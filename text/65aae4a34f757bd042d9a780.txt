Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a review of budget closeout transactions at the Maryland
Department of Health (MDH), the Department of Human Services (DHS), and the
Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2023. Our review disclosed certain transactions made by each of the three
agencies were either not in compliance, or otherwise represented significant
conditions that warrant disclosure in this report. A summary of our findings, by
agency, is included in Exhibit 1.
Our review disclosed that MDH, DHS, and MSDE could not provide
documentation to support the propriety of significant accrued federal fund
revenue transactions. As explained further in this report, the agencies recorded
the accrued revenues based on the balance in the accounts at year-end without
verifying that the transactions accurately represented amounts collectible from the
federal government and could not readily demonstrate that the funds were
subsequently recovered.
Certain of the amounts accrued did not seem reasonable. For example, the net
accrued federal revenues recorded by MSDE represented more than 30 percent of
its 2023 federal expenditures when they recovered federal funds on a monthly
basis. In addition, MDH’s accrued revenues for certain accounts were identical to
those in one or more prior years. While some or all of these amounts may
ultimately be recovered by the three departments, to the extent that the federal
funds are not available, State general funds may be needed to cover any related
deficits.

--- Page 4 ---
We also identified certain transactions recorded by DHS and MSDE whereby
these agencies avoided reverting unused general fund appropriations totaling $17
million and $1.4 million, respectively.
MDH had unprovided for payables and other general fund liabilities totaling $123
million as of June 30, 2023, which included obligations related to certain
disallowed claims for federal funds and unfulfilled spending requirements. These
potential liabilities represent longstanding unresolved conditions that were
disclosed in one or more of our preceding closeout reports. Depending on the
resolution of these matters with the federal government, the expenditures related
to these liabilities may have to be funded with subsequent year appropriations, or
through a deficiency appropriation. MDH also did not properly disclose
unrecoverable federal funds potentially totaling $8.8 million, as required.
Finally, MSDE did not always properly account for special fund revenue.
Consequently, MSDE reported inaccurate fund balances to the Comptroller of
Maryland’s General Accounting Division (GAD) at year-end, including several
significant deficit balances that could not be readily explained, such as a $230
million deficit for the Maryland Education Trust Fund.
The primary objective of this annual review is to alert the Maryland General
Assembly to significant financial and budgetary closeout transactions that do not
comply with applicable laws, regulations, and policies or otherwise represent
significant matters relating to closeout that we noted and which we believe
warrant disclosure in this report. Nevertheless, we advised the appropriate
agencies of our findings, and formal responses were not requested since this
report contains no recommendations. The issues identified during this review will
be fully addressed, as appropriate, in our fiscal compliance audit reports on the
applicable agencies, which will include relevant recommendations.
Since this report contains no recommendations, formal responses were not
requested. However, given the significance and repeat status of certain MDH
findings from the prior fiscal year 2022 report, MDH requested the opportunity to
provide written comments to be included in the current report. Although this was
an unusual request and was contrary to our historical presentation, we agreed to
include MDH’s comments as an addendum to this report. Since MDH’s
comments do not constitute a formal response, we did not review the comments
further.

Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closeout transactions that have not been previously recorded in the
State’s accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Annual Comprehensive
Financial Report.
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report, which, as of January 3, 2024, had not yet been
finalized for fiscal year 2023. The firm will determine whether the State’s
financial statements have been presented fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the State of Maryland as of June 30, 2023, and the
respective changes in the financial position and cash flows, for the year then
ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (referred to as GAAP).

Introduction, Objective, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2023. This review was conducted under the authority of the
State Government Article, Section 2-1220 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
The objective of our review was to determine whether budget closeout
transactions processed by the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), the
Department of Human Services (DHS), and the Maryland State Department of
Education (MSDE), for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, were properly
supported and made in accordance with State budgetary laws, regulations, and
accounting policies and to determine if other significant liabilities or conditions
relating to closeout existed at fiscal year-end.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end transactions for MDH, DHS,
and MSDE, based on our assessment of risk and materiality, to ascertain if the
transactions were properly supported and made in accordance with State
budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies and to determine if other
significant liabilities or conditions relating to closeout existed at fiscal year-end.
We reviewed, on a limited basis, transactions processed subsequent to June 30,
2023 to determine if the transactions were properly recorded (such as charged or
credited to the proper fiscal year).
Our review was limited to MDH, DHS, and MSDE based our professional
judgment as to the overall significance and potential impact on the State’s General
Fund of those three departments’ year-end closing activity in relation to the State
as a whole. We also determined that two of the findings included in this report
were conditions repeated from our January 26, 2023 report entitled Statewide
Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2022 (see Exhibit 1).
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
reported. We advised MDH, DHS, and MSDE of our findings. Formal responses
were not requested since this report contains no recommendations. MDH’s
comments were included as an addendum to this report, but do not constitute a
formal response. Our fieldwork was conducted during the period from September
2023 to December 2023.

Change in Scope and Methodology
During our current review we focused on MDH, DHS, and MSDE closeout
transactions. This change in approach was the result of concerns related to
MDH’s federal fund accounting procedures raised during our Statewide Review of
Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2022 and subsequent fiscal
compliance audit report of the MDH - Office of the Secretary and Other Units
(dated October 19, 2023). Accordingly, we chose to focus our current year’s
review on MDH, DHS, and MSDE, which collectively accounted for $16.4 billion
(81 percent) of the State’s $20.3 billion in federal fund expenditures during fiscal
year 2023.
Federal fund expenditures are generally recovered on a reimbursable basis (the
State incurs the costs and then is reimbursed by the federal government). As a
result, agencies generally have a federal fund receivable at year end for amounts
expended for which the related federal revenue has not yet been recovered.

Findings
Accrued Revenue Transactions
Background
The Comptroller of Maryland - General Accounting Division (GAD) requires all
federal fund accounts to be zeroed out at year-end. To accomplish this, agencies
must record an accrued revenue for any amounts due or defer any balances to the
next year (such as by recording a negative accrued revenue transaction) as further
described in Figure 1.

Explanation
Balance Revenue
 Expenditures exceed the revenue recorded in the account.
 A positive accrued revenue entry is recorded to close the
Deficit Positive
account at zero, with the expectation that the funds will be
received in the next fiscal year.
 Revenues exceed the expenditures recorded in the account.
 A negative accrued revenue entry is recorded to close the
Surplus Negative
account at zero, deferring the recognition of revenues, for funds
already received, to the next fiscal year.
GAD year-end closing instructions provide that these transactions should reflect
amounts that are collectable within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year and that
revenue should be recognized in the same fiscal year the expenditure is made.
The closing instructions also require that detail documentation to support the
transactions be maintained.
At the end of fiscal year 2023, MDH, DHS, and MSDE recorded accrued federal
fund revenue entries totaling $10.5 billion, comprised of positive accrued revenue
entries totaling $6 billion (recording a receivable for anticipated future funds due)
and negative accrued revenue entries totaling $4.5 billion (deferring revenue
received to the subsequent year) (see Figure 2 on the following page). The net
10

--- Page 13 ---
entries, totaling $1.5 billion, represent the amount needed to offset deficit account
balances at year-end.

Finding 1
MDH could not provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued
federal fund revenue totaling approximately $2.3 billion or the subsequent
recovery of the funds.
Analysis
MDH was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of
approximately $2.3 billion in accrued federal fund revenue or the subsequent
recovery of the funds. At the end of fiscal year 2023, MDH recorded 1,221
accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $7.9 billion, including 794 positive
accrued revenue entries totaling $4.3 billion (recording a receivable for
anticipated future funds due) and 427 negative accrued revenue entries totaling
$3.6 billion (deferring revenue received to the subsequent year).
1The net accrued revenue recorded at the end of fiscal year 2023 decreased significantly from
2022. The decrease was the result of MDH recovering approximately $973 million after we
notified them of missing reconciliations subsequent to the 2022 closeout. In addition, MDH,
with the support and assistance of the Department of Budget and Management, transferred funds
between accounts with longstanding surplus balances to accounts with longstanding deficit
balances. While MDH could not provide definitive documentation that the funds in these
accounts were related, the transfers did have the desired effect of eliminating longstanding
account balances. We acknowledge that obtaining such support may not be possible or cost
effective due to the longstanding nature of the associated balances.
11

--- Page 14 ---
MDH Could Not Support Accrued Revenue Entries Tested
We selected 8 of the positive journal entries totaling $2.5 billion, including a
$230.7 million accrued revenue journal entry posted to a federal funds clearing
account in the Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA). MDH could not
readily document that 5 of the positive entries (totaling $2.3 billion) accurately
reflected amounts collectable from the federal government. MDH used an
automated script to record year-end revenue entries to offset positive and negative
account balances at year-end without verifying that the amounts recorded were
valid and collectable.
An evaluation of these year-end account balances at year-end is critical because of
the significant amount of federal funds MDH receives each year, which may mask
unrecovered expenditures. Deficit balances would be expected at year-end (or on
any given date) since MDH program costs are generally recovered on a
reimbursable basis. However, the aforementioned $230.7 million deficit balance
in the clearing account is questionable since the account is only used to record and
account for federal revenues until allocation to the appropriate accounts and
therefore, should not have a negative balance. In this context, the entry recorded
for this account represents a $230.7 million shortfall in Medicaid reimbursements
as of June 30, 2023.
Furthermore, our analysis of all 1,221 accrued revenue entries disclosed that 408
entries (33 percent) related to accounts that had no expenditure activity recorded
during fiscal year 2023, including 202 positive entries made to eliminate deficit
balances totaling $619.3 million. In addition, 48 percent (197) of the 408 entries
were identical to automated entries made in one or more prior fiscal years dating
as far back as June 30, 2015 (see Figure 3 on the following page).

Source: State accounting records
Accrued revenue entries that are identical to entries made in previous fiscal years
or for accounts without related current year expenditures raise concerns that
federal reimbursement for previous State payments may not have been requested
or may no longer be available. Although MDH senior fiscal management
personnel advised that many of these positive entries (deficit account balances)
were offset by negative entries (surplus account balances), as of December 2023,
MDH had not offset these amounts and could not document the extent to which
the underlying account balances were related.
MDH Could Not Document it Recovered the Recorded Accrued Revenue
As of December 2023, MDH could not document that 5 of the aforementioned
accrued revenue entries tested had been recovered from the federal government.
For example, two of the accrued revenues totaling $1.99 billion were to offset
longstanding Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) balances for
which MDH believes the funds had been collected and allocated to other accounts
but could not provide documentation for this assertion. Another entry was for an
account used for COVID relief funds that were advanced to MDH and per MDH
management had been overspent by $53 million. MDH management believe this
amount is recoverable under a federal FEMA grant but had not yet attempted to
recover the funds. For another $44.9 million accrued revenue entry related to
Medicaid funds, MDH management acknowledged that $15.6 million is related to
13

--- Page 16 ---
prior years and needs further analysis to determine whether funds were collected
and misallocated, or if the amount was not recovered.
While some or all of these amounts may ultimately be recovered, to the extent
that the federal funds are not available, State general funds may be needed to
cover any related deficits. Similar conditions were noted during our Statewide
Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2022 and our subsequent
fiscal compliance audit report of the MDH – Office of the Secretary and Other
Units (dated October 19, 2023). MDH advised that it had not fully implemented
corrective action in response to these prior findings.
Finding 2
The Department of Human Services (DHS) could not provide documentation
to support the propriety of its accrued federal fund revenue entries or the
subsequent recovery of the funds.
Analysis
DHS was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of its accrued
federal fund revenue entries. At the end of fiscal year 2023, DHS recorded 21
accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $1.3 billion, consisting of 18
positive accrued revenue entries totaling $781.4 million and 3 negative accrued
revenue entries totaling $543.3 million.
DHS Could Not Support Accrued Revenue Entries
DHS maintains a database (outside of the State’s accounting records) to track
expenditures and revenues received for each of its federal grant programs. DHS
advised us that the accrued revenue entries recorded in the State’s accounting
records equaled the net amount receivable for all of its federal grants according to
this database. However, DHS did not analyze the accrued revenue entries (which
reflected combined activity for multiple federal grants) to ensure the amounts
were related to current (fiscal year 2023) expenditures and to identify variances
indicative of errors in the underlying account balances.
An evaluation of the balances at year-end is critical because of the significant
amount of federal funds DHS receives each year, which may mask unrecovered
expenditures or errors in DHS’ accounting records. Specifically, we noted that
DHS did not identify certain questionable accrued revenue transactions, including
a $292.1 million entry to eliminate the deficit balance in an account that only had
expenditures of $22.2 million during fiscal year 2023. We compared this entry to
the accrued revenue entries for the account during prior years and noted that the
amount had increased from $10.9 million in fiscal year 2020 to $223.4 million in
14

--- Page 17 ---
fiscal year 2022, even though the annual expenditures for this account on DHS’
accounting records never exceeded $27 million.
DHS did not consider these questionable balances until we brought the matter to
its attention during our current closeout review. In response to our inquiry, DHS
advised that the deficit balance in this account was the result of certain journal
entries recorded since fiscal year 2021 that erroneously allocated revenue from
the account to offset expenditures in other unrelated accounts. DHS further
advised that it had received the entire amount accrued and that the $292.1 million
entry was offset by one of the negative entries (surplus account balance) for
another account. However, as of December 7, 2023, DHS had not corrected the
erroneous journal entries and consequently could not readily document the extent
to which the underlying account balances were related.
DHS Could Not Document it Recovered the Recorded Accrued Revenue
DHS could not readily support that the June 30, 2023 fiscal year-end accrued
revenues were received in the subsequent fiscal year. DHS advised that
approximately half of the amount accrued was received in fiscal year 2024 and
the remaining accrued revenue was related to accrued expenditures recorded at
year end that will be recovered once the expenses are realized. As of December
2023, DHS had not allocated funds from the accounts where the revenues were
initially credited by the Office of the State Treasurer2 to the accounts where the
related accrued revenue entries were recorded.
As a result, we could not readily determine whether the funds received in the
subsequent year were related to the amounts accrued. While some or all of these
amounts may ultimately be recovered, to the extent that the federal funds are not
available, State general funds may be needed to cover any related deficits.
Finding 3
MSDE could not provide documentation to support the propriety of
approximately $1.3 billion in accrued federal fund revenue or the subsequent
recovery of the funds.
Analysis
MSDE could not support the propriety of approximately $1.3 billion in accrued
federal fund revenue. At the end of fiscal year 2023, there were 41 accrued
federal fund revenue transactions recorded in MSDE financial records totaling
$1.3 billion, consisting of 24 positive accrued revenue entries (recording a

related State agency’s accounts to reflect the receipt of funds.
15

--- Page 18 ---
receivable for anticipated future funds due) totaling $951.9 million, and 17
negative accrued revenue entries (deferred revenue) totaling $346.5 million. Even
if the aforementioned balances are related, the net receivable of $604.6 million
represents 35 percent of MSDE’s fiscal year 2023 expenditures that totaled $1.73
billion (see Figure 2). Given that MSDE’s practice is to recover federal funds
monthly, the amount recorded could indicate untimely recovery or uncollectable
federal funds.
MSDE Could Not Support Accrued Revenue Entries Tested
MSDE recorded accrued revenues based on the balances for each budgetary
appropriation number, each of which included multiple federal grants, without
reviewing the entries to ensure the accruals represented amounts due for each
grant. MSDE did not analyze the accrued revenue entries (which reflected
combined activity for multiple federal grants) to ensure the amounts were related
to current expenditures and to identify any variances indicative of errors in the
underlying account balances. Consequently, this process did not ensure that the
accrued revenue entries were proper and represented amounts that were actually
collectable in the subsequent year.
Our review of certain of these accrued revenue entries identified amounts that
appeared improper or otherwise unsupportable. For example, in one clearing
account, MSDE recorded a negative accrued revenue which deferred federal fund
revenues totaling $181.7 million to fiscal year 2024. However, MSDE
management could not document that the $181.7 million in federal revenue was
related to fiscal year 2024 expenditures to justify the transaction. Since federal
funds are generally received subsequent to the expenditures being incurred,
MSDE should have allocated the funds to offset any deficit balances in other
accounts in fiscal year 2023.
MSDE Could Not Document it Recovered the Recorded Accrued Revenue
MSDE could not readily demonstrate that the accrued revenues were received in
the subsequent fiscal year. MSDE management advised us that they track
revenue by federal grant rather than the specific accrual. We selected federal fund
recoveries associated with six grants to see whether the amounts accrued, totaling
$519.2 million, were subsequently recovered. Our review disclosed that as of
December 1, 2023 MSDE had only recovered $263.1 million during fiscal year
2024 related to these accrued revenues3 and was unable to provide support for the
remaining $256.1 million (see Figure 4 on the following page).
3 Other federal funds received were related to fiscal year 2024 expenditures.

Certain of the amounts that had not been collected date back to fiscal year 2022.
For example, $40 million of the $80 million outstanding for COVID Grant -
Healthy School Facilities Fund was carried over from the fiscal year 2022
closeout. MSDE management advised us that this grant is administered by the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for the Interagency Commission
on School Construction (IAC).5 Although this entry was made by MSDE, MSDE
had not pursued the matter with DBM to determine the reason for the lack of
recovery of these funds from the federal grantor. While some or all of these
amounts may ultimately be recovered, to the extent that the federal funds are not
available, general funds may be needed to cover any related deficits.
4 MSDE accounted for this grant in separate phases.
5 Chapter 679, Laws of Maryland 2023, established the IAC as an independent unit of State
Government effective July 1, 2023. Previously, the IAC operated as an independent unit of the
Maryland State Department of Education.

Expenditure Transactions
Finding 4
DHS did not revert unused general fund appropriations totaling $17 million
as required by State law.
Analysis
DHS did not revert unused general fund appropriations totaling $17 million in
accordance with State law.
 At fiscal year-end, DHS recorded accrued expenditures totaling $20.4 million
related to estimated foster care payments for the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2023 and subsequently realized all of these expenditures in fiscal year 2024.
However, our review disclosed that according to DHS records actual foster
care expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled only $18.6 million and
therefore, the remaining $1.8 million should have been reverted to the State’s
General Fund. Our further review disclosed a similar transaction made in
fiscal year 2023 whereby DHS improperly retained $506,000 of its fiscal year
2022 foster care appropriation.
 DHS could not provide support for the transfers of unspent general funds from
fiscal years 2021 ($2.3 million) and 2022 ($12.4 million) totaling $14.7
million that were used to offset fiscal year 2023 budget shortfalls in various
programs such as child welfare services. DHS advised that the expenditures
were related to accrued expenditures or encumbrances recorded during those
prior fiscal years; however, as of December 2023, DHS could not provide
documentation to support this assertion.
Finding 5
MSDE transferred federal fund expenditures totaling approximately $1.4
million to the General Fund to avoid reverting unspent general fund
appropriations at fiscal year-end.
Analysis
MSDE transferred federal fund expenditures totaling approximately $1.4 million
to the General Fund to avoid reverting unspent general fund appropriations at
year-end. MSDE received a federal grant in fiscal year 2023 for the development
or subsequent implementation of standards-based State academic assessments.
MSDE recorded related grant expenditures as federal expenditures as they
occurred during the year. However, rather than use the federal grant funds for the
18

--- Page 21 ---
purpose intended, and to avoid reverting any unspent general fund appropriation
to the State at fiscal year-end, MSDE processed a journal entry to reclassify
approximately $1.4 million of these federal expenditures as general fund
expenditures. The use of general funds when federal funds are available is a
violation of State law. Specifically, Chapter 484, Laws of Maryland 2022 (Fiscal
Year 2023 Budget Bill) states that federal funds shall be charged before State
funds are charged.
Other Liabilities
Finding 6
MDH reported $123 million in unprovided for general fund payables and
other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2023.
Analysis
MDH reported unprovided for payables and other potential general fund liabilities
totaling approximately $123 million as of June 30, 2023. As detailed below, this
amount consists of three different components: $34.2 million in unresolved
longstanding disallowed federal fund claims related to the DDA residential
habilitation add-on services under its Community Pathways waiver program (a
Medicaid funded program), $32.8 million related to estimated reimbursements to
Medicaid providers that exceeded the appropriation for MCPA, and a potential
liability to the federal government of approximately $56 million for an obligation
relating to the Rebalancing Fund Demonstration which is associated with the
MCPA Money Follows the Person (MFP) program.
Disallowed DDA Claims
In June 2018, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
notified MDH that it was disallowing claims made between July 1, 2010 and June
30, 2013, totaling $34.2 million, related to add-on services for certain consumers
that DDA approved without considering the consumers’ level of need. The
Maryland Office of Attorney General, on behalf of MDH and DDA, appealed
CMS’ decision to the federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
Departmental Appeals Board; however, as of November 2023, DHHS had not
responded to this appeal.
CMS will assess interest accrued on any amounts it determines were properly
disallowed beginning on the date of initial disallowance (June 2018).
Consequently, the total federal liability may exceed $34.2 million. Comments
regarding this matter have been made in our eight preceding Statewide Review of
Budget Closeout Transactions reports.
19

--- Page 22 ---
Unprovided For Medicaid Payments
MDH reported an unprovided for payable of $32.8 million related to estimated
reimbursements to Medicaid providers for services rendered during fiscal year
2023 that had not been billed to MCPA as of June 30, 2023. Consequently, these
expenditures may have to be funded with subsequent year appropriations (or
through a deficiency appropriation).
Potential Liability for Unspent MFP Funds
MDH reported a potential liability to the federal government of approximately
$56 million as of June 30, 2023 for an obligation related to enhanced funding
received under the MCPA MFP program. Specifically, the State agreed to accept
federal funds covering 75 percent of its MFP program expenditures instead of the
more traditional 50 percent federal funding arrangement used in many other
federal assistance programs. The 25 percent savings that the State realized from
the enhanced federal reimbursement rate is required to be spent on additional
MFP program expenditures.
As noted in in our Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal
Years 2021 and 2022 reports, MDH had continuously failed to spend the savings
on MFP program expenditures resulting in a growing potential liability.
Specifically, the potential liability reported by MDH for fiscal years ending 2021,
and 2022 totaled $49.3 million and $52 million, respectively, and as of June 30,
2023 was $56 million. MDH has until September 30, 2025 to spend the savings
on MFP program expenditures or the remaining unspent savings will need to be
returned to the federal government.
Finding 7
MDH did not properly report unrecoverable federal funds totaling up to $8.8
million to GAD.
Analysis
MDH did not properly report unrecoverable federal funds potentially totaling $8.8
million to GAD. Our October 26, 2022 DDA report noted that DDA did not
recover federal fund expenditures totaling $8.8 million related to provider
payments made in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. In April 2023, MDH, on behalf of
DDA, advised that these funds were no longer recoverable. 6. However, in
response to our inquires during the current closeout review, MDH advised that
DDA was still investigating the matter and had determined that certain payments
included in the $8.8 million were never eligible for federal reimbursement based
6 Federal regulations require claims to be submitted for reimbursement within two years after the
calendar quarter in which the expenditures were made.

--- Page 23 ---
on the type of service provided. MDH maintains that these costs were properly
charged as general fund expenditures so the amount of actual unrecoverable
federal funds is less than $8.8 million.7
MDH advised that it would disclose the results of the investigation to the
Department of Budget and Management and GAD when it was completed, but
acknowledged that at least some of the aforementioned $8.8 million is no longer
recoverable. As a result, State general funds may have been used to cover any
related deficits.
Special Funds
Finding 8
MSDE did not always properly allocate special fund revenue, resulting in
inaccurate fund balances being reported to GAD at year-end, including
deficit balances that could not be readily explained.
Analysis
MSDE did not always properly allocate special fund revenue, resulting in
inaccurate fund balances being reported to GAD at year-end, including deficit
balances that could not be readily explained. Consequently, to the extent that
special funds are not available for the aforementioned deficit balances, general
funds may be required. MSDE accounted for each of its special funds in one or
more appropriation numbers and at year end reported net balances totaling
approximately $2.43 billion. We reviewed four special fund balances (see Figure
5 on the following page) that were accounted for under several appropriation
numbers.
7 Due to the timing constraints of this review, our Office will analyze any additional support
provided by MDH or DDA on this matter during our next fiscal compliance audit of DDA.

Source: State accounting records
Our review disclosed that MSDE did not allocate special fund revenues resulting
in deficit account balances in certain appropriation numbers for the Blueprint for
Maryland’s Future and the Maryland Education Trust Fund totaling $1.35 billion
and $230 million, respectively. Subsequent to our review, MSDE investigated the
Blueprint for Maryland’s Future balances and processed a journal entry in
December 2023 to eliminate the deficits. MSDE advised us that it still needs to
research the reported activity for the Maryland Education Trust Fund to determine
if similar entries can be made to eliminate the deficit balances.
For two other special funds, Dedicated Purpose Fund and Cigarette Restitution
Fund, the net ending balance resulted in a deficit that could not readily be
explained. Our review disclosed deficit year-end net balances totaling
approximately $10.9 million in these two special funds (Dedicated Purpose Fund
totaling $10.2 million and the Cigarette Restitution Fund totaling $721,000).
MSDE receives revenue for these funds from other State agencies to support
MSDE activities. After we brought this to MSDE’s attention, it began
investigating these balances, but as of November 2023 it had not determined a
resolution.

ADDENDUM
January 17, 2024
Mr. Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor
Office of Legislative Audits
The Warehouse at Camden Yards
351 West Camden Street, Suite 400
Baltimore, MD 21201
Dear Mr. Hook:
The Maryland Department of Health (Department) appreciates the steadfast work of the Office
of Legislative Audits (OLA) to identify critical fiscal processes and controls in need of
improvement at the Department. We remain committed to addressing the severe audit findings
contained in this report, as well as OLA’s findings and recommendations issued in calendar
2023.
The Department recognizes that the fiscal year 2023 closeout findings document continued fiscal
challenges, and we have made strides to improve fiscal accountability in several areas. The
Department has engaged an external accounting firm to support the Department’s efforts to
improve fiscal practices. Working with this external firm, the Department has made progress in
several areas, including:
• Performing a reconciliation between the Department’s main payment and fiscal systems. A
standardized reconciliation methodology is being used across all relevant fiscal years.
• Updating fiscal standard operating procedures (SOPs) and business process flows.
• Performing a current state assessment to identify operational and organizational opportunities
to optimize the future state of the Department’s Office of Finance. This will strengthen our
ability to quickly identify and mitigate future risks including improvement of internal
controls and increase the accuracy of financial reporting.
Next steps will include updating and enhancing business processes that enable consistency in
execution and generate auditable supporting documentation. We also plan to develop dashboards
and analytical reports to monitor reconciliations more easily and identify variances.

--- Page 27 ---
The Moore-Miller Administration is committed to service, transparency, and accountable
stewardship of taxpayer dollars. My leadership team is dedicated to improving processes within
the Department that will ultimately result in better service to Marylanders.
We look forward to our continued work with OLA to correct these findings. If you have any
questions, please contact Frederick D. Doggett at 410-767-0885 or email at
frederick.doggett@maryland.gov.
Sincerely,
Laura Herrera Scott, MD, MPH
