Mr. Karl S. Aro, Executive Director

Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we have performed desk reviews of the audit reports filed by each county,
incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2009. The desk reviews consisted of assessments of compliance with
accounting and auditing standards, evaluations of compliance with certain State
laws, and analyses of selected financial data to identify potential financial
problems.
Most of the local governments and their independent auditors substantially
complied with accounting and auditing standards for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2009. Nevertheless, we identified instances of noncompliance with certain
requirements of our audit guidelines, generally accepted accounting principles,
and/or generally accepted auditing standards. Letters were sent to 46 local
governments and to their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies
disclosed by our reviews so that corrective actions could be taken to help ensure
future compliance.

--- Page 4 ---
The financial statements disclosed 11 local governments with uninsured or
uncollateralized bank deposits, which is an area of noncompliance with State law.
In addition, our desk reviews identified 9 local governments with potential
financial problems, including deficit fund balances and unfavorable financial
trends. Where appropriate, letters were sent to these local governments, and to
their legislative representatives, to communicate their noncompliance or potential
financial problems, and to request that the local governments advise us of the
corrective actions that will be taken.
Respectfully submitted,
Bruce A. Myers, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Introduction and Scope
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires each
county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland to file annual
(once every four years under specified conditions) audit reports. There were 192
local government audit reports due for fiscal year 2009 (24 counties, 152 cities
and towns, and 16 taxing districts). The reports are to include financial
statements with accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions
as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented. The financial
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. We have prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide
additional information regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing
requirements.
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code requires the Office of Legislative Audits to
perform a desk review of each local government’s annual audit report for
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards.
Subsections (b) through (f) of Section 40 specify the reporting and review
requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by the counties. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is required to
review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2009 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as seven fiscal year 2008 reports (Town of Capitol Heights, Town of Deer
Park, Town of Forest Heights, City of Hyattsville, Town of Lonaconing, Town of
Westernport, and the Washington Suburban Transit Commission) and one fiscal
year 2007 report (Town of Forest Heights) received subsequent to our previous
review. The desk reviews were performed to accomplish the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and accounting and
auditing standards, using a checklist for governmental audits published by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits).

 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances, underfunded pension plans, or unfavorable trends and ratios,
based on analyses of financial data over the most recent five-year period (July
1, 2004 through June 30, 2009).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2009 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
Nine local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal year 2009, as of
June 23, 2010. Twenty-eight local governments submitted audit reports after
the required filing date.
Nine local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal year 2009.
Furthermore, 28 local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date. The failure of a local government to file an audit report, or a delay in
filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The submission
of audit reports after the required filing date was also noted for 19 of these 28
local governments during our preceding year’s review. Article 19, Section 40(a)
of the Annotated Code of Maryland generally requires audit reports to be filed by
November 1 after the close of the fiscal year, or by January 1 after the close of the
fiscal year for those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 had not been received, as of
June 23, 2010, for the following nine local governments:
1. Town of Capitol Heights
2. Town of Eagle Harbor
3. Town of Fairmount Heights
4. Town of Forest Heights
5. City of Hyattsville
6. Town of Lonaconing
7. Town of Sharptown
8. Town of Westernport
9. Mount Savage Special Taxing Area
We will review these fiscal year 2009 audit reports and take any follow-up action
necessary when the reports are received. The results of these reviews will be
included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2010 local government audit
reports.

The towns of Brookview, Church Creek, Eldorado, Galestown, Goldsboro,
Henderson, Hillsboro Mardela Springs, and Queen Anne requested and were
granted a waiver from filing an audit report in fiscal year 2009 because the towns
met the conditions for filing an audit report every fourth year as provided for
under Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code. These towns will next be required to
file an audit report for fiscal year 2012. The Town of Barclay, the Village of Port
Tobacco, and the Ellerslie Special Taxing Area had previously requested and
were granted waivers from filing audit reports. These entities will next be
required to file an audit report for either fiscal year 2010 or fiscal year 2011.
The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion on
one opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit, and one
other local government’s report contained a qualified opinion on certain
opinion units.
The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion on one
opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit, and one other local
government’s report contained a qualified opinion on certain opinion units. The
following is a summary of these opinions:
The audit report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion (a
statement that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles) on the discretely presented component
unit opinion unit because of the omission of financial data for the Town’s legally
separate component unit. The Town’s audit report also contained a qualified
opinion (statement that, except for the effects of the matter to which the
qualification relates, the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles) on the governmental activities
opinion unit because the Town had not measured the effect of Government
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 49 entitled “Accounting and
Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligations.”. Thus, the Town’s
financial statements were not presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles as required by State law.
The audit report for the City of Westminster contained a qualified opinion on the
business-type activities and Water Fund opinion units because City management
had not measured the effect of the Government Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 42 entitled “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Impairment
of Capital Assets and for Insurance Recoveries.” Thus, the City’s financial
statements were not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles as required by State law.

Auditors’ reports for nine local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for nine local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The following is a
summary of these deficiencies:
Number of Audit
Area of Noncompliance
Reports
Auditor’s report did not properly report on all required 4
information (for example, supplemental information
accompanying the basic financial statements).
Auditor did not express an opinion(s) on all opinion units 3
or on all financial statements.
Auditor’s report did not include all basic elements of an 2
audit report (for example, auditor did not sign the audit
report).
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires that audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. These
standards require, in part, that the auditor express an opinion(s) as to whether the
basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position, the respective changes in financial position, and cash flows,
where applicable, of the local government in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Financial statements submitted by 18 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 18 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of one of these local governments included two such deficiencies, and
the financial statements of two of these local governments included a deficiency
that was also cited during our preceding year’s review. The following is a
summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of instances:

Number of
Deficiency
Instances
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 13
presentation of Statement of Cash Flows was
improper).
All required financial statements were not presented or 6
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.
Financial statements and accompanying notes for six local governments did
not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or in
the accompanying notes, for six audit reports. Adequate disclosure is necessary to
facilitate the understanding of, and to provide for fair presentation of, the financial
information. The following is a summary of these areas of insufficient disclosure
and the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Area of Insufficient Disclosure
Instances
Long-term debt 4
Cash deposits with financial institutions 2
Noncompliance with State Law
Financial statements of 11 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law.
Financial statements of 11 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by State
law (Exhibit A). Article 95, Section 22 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires that deposits with financial institutions by local governmental units be
fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes the risk of loss of deposits in
the event the financial institution defaults.

Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for six local
governments as of June 30, 2009.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for six local governments as
of June 30, 2009 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of the
current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem. Four of these local governments also had a general
fund deficit as of June 30, 2008, including one that has had such a deficit since
June 30, 2006.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for three local
governments as of June 30, 2009.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for three local governments
as of June 30, 2009 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local governments had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures. Significant unfavorable trends and ratios
were also noted for two of these local governments in the preceding year’s
review.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Code. Subsections (b) through (f) of this Section require that certain types of
special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the county in
which the districts are located within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year, in
accordance with the rules and regulations established by the applicable county.
The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each district’s compliance with
the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting copies of these reports to
the Office of Legislative Audits.

The required reports have not been filed for eight special taxing districts as
of June 23, 2010.
As of June 23, 2010, we had not received the required reports for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2009 for eight special taxing districts, seven of which are located
in Anne Arundel County and one is located in Baltimore City. Anne Arundel
County and Baltimore City advised us that they were in the process of pursuing
compliance with applicable filing requirements for these districts and that
appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding funds).
