Report Overview

MDH is responsible for promoting the health of the public and for
strengthening partnerships between State and local governments,
the business community, and all health care providers in
Maryland.

The audit report covers the period from February 12, 2019 to June
30, 2022. The report contains 17 findings, including 2 repeat
findings from the prior audit report.

We determined that MDH’s accountability and compliance level
was unsatisfactory in accordance with the rating system we
established in conformity with State law. The primary factors
contributing to this rating were the number and significance of the
audit findings.

Federal Funds (Finding 1)
MDH did not have procedures to ensure MDH units properly entered
all provider payments into MMIS II and resolved any rejected claims
to enable timely and complete recovery of the funds. As a result,
certain claims were not entered into or were rejected by MMIS II, and
therefore the related federal funds were not recovered.

Four of our most recent five DDA audit reports have noted
instances in which federal funds were not recovered because the
payments were not recorded in MMIS II. Most recently, our
October 26, 2022 report noted that $8.8 million was not recorded
in MMIS II and the funds are no longer recoverable.

Our October 25, 2022 BHA – ASO report disclosed that BHA had
unresolved denied claims totaling approximately $106.7 million
that had not been investigated as of September 2021.

Federal Funds (Finding 2)
MDH did not ensure critical quarterly reconciliations were performed,
resulting in the failure to recover $973.3 million of federal funding
and lost investment income totaling $6.4 million.

In August 2022, we noted that MDH had not conducted
reconciliations for activity during the period from October 2019 to
June 2022. These reconciliations ensure that amounts requested
from the federal government agreed to MDH’s actual expenditures
and are used to adjust subsequent reimbursement requests.

After bringing this to MDH’s attention, MDH performed the
reconciliations and identified and recovered $973.3 million.

We estimated the failure to recover these funds timely resulted in
lost investment income of $6.4 million.

Federal Funds (Finding 3)
MDH did not have procedures to ensure requests for federal fund
reimbursement were subsequently received.

MDH did not verify the receipt of federal fund reimbursements for
the Medicaid, MCHIP, and MFP grants that collectively accounted
for 96 percent ($10.2 billion) of MDH’s $10.6 billion in federal
fund expenditures in fiscal year 2022.

Although our testing did not identify any instances in which federal
fund reimbursement requests were not received, given the
significant amount of federal funds associated with these grants,
MDH should establish a documented procedure to ensure each
federal fund request is received.

Office of Legislative Audits
Federal Funds (Finding 4)
MDH did not have procedures to ensure federal fund reimbursements
were properly allocated to the appropriate accounts and could not
determine whether all federal funds had been recovered.

MDH allocated federal funds from the Medicaid clearing account to
the related expenditure accounts without considering the amount of
revenue available for distribution. As of June 30, 2022, the
Medicaid clearing account reflected a $1.1 billion deficit balance.

As of June 30, 2022, federal fund revenues totaling $2.8 billion had
not been allocated from the DDA, MCHIP, and MFP subsidiary
accounts to the related expenditure accounts.

MDH did not update its procedures to reflect changes in the DDA
federal fund accounting process. While federal funds totaling $301
million were likely allocated to non-DDA expenditure accounts (such
as Medicaid), MDH could not determine the disposition of the funds.

Federal Funds (Finding 4 continued)
MDH could not determine the extent to which numerous positive and
negative account balances were related. Our analysis disclosed that
33 percent of the 2022 FY-end account balances were identical to
balances in one or more prior years dating back to FY 2015.

Budgetary and Year-End Closing (Finding 5)
MDH used an automated script to record year-end revenue entries
without verifying the amounts recorded were valid and collectable.

At the end of fiscal year 2022, MDH recorded 1,250 accrued
federal fund revenue entries totaling approximately $10.2 billion.

517 entries (41 percent) related to accounts that had no
expenditure activity recorded during fiscal year 2022.

361 of the 517 entries (70 percent) were identical to entries
made in one or more prior fiscal years dating back to 2015.

The lack of current year expenditures and the age of these entries
raises concerns that federal reimbursement for previous State
payments may not have been requested and may no longer be
available.

Procurements and Disbursements (Finding 6)
MDH used an emergency contract for services unrelated to the
original procurement without sufficient documentation that the
services were received and the payments were proper.

MDH could not justify three contract modifications that increased
the scope and cost of the contract by $62 million.

MDH could not document that it requested, reviewed, and
approved the work the vendor performed.

MDH did not obtain statements of work for each vendor employee
as required by the contract.

Vendor invoices did not include documentation that would allow
MDH to verify the billings were proper.

Other Financial-Related Findings
Finding 7 – Procurements and Disbursements (Repeat Finding)
MDH did not always comply with State procurement regulations
when procuring goods and services via sole source and emergency
contracts and did not always publish contract solicitations and
awards as required.
Finding 13 – Accounts Receivable
MDH was eight months behind on billing for services rendered at
MDH inpatient facilities, which could total approximately $45.4
million.

Other Financial-Related Findings (continued)
Finding 14 & 15 – Payroll

MDH did not ensure the propriety of biweekly payroll payments,
leave balances, and timesheets. (Repeat Finding)

MDH did ensure that employees who were terminated or left State
service were promptly removed from payroll, resulting in improper
payments to at least 45 former employees totaling $151,000.
Finding 16 – Cash Receipts
MDH did not timely endorse and deposit collections, verify collections
were deposited, and require electronic submission of large payments.
Finding 17 – Executive Oversight
MDH did not ensure that appropriate corrective actions were
implemented to address prior findings from our Office’s fiscal
compliance audits of the other MDH units.

Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2023
Background

OLA conducts an annual review of budget closeout transactions,
for the general purpose of alerting the Maryland General Assembly
of issues that could impact the State’s budget.

Our review of the 2022 closeout and fiscal compliance audit of
MDH (noted in our earlier slides) identified significant concerns
with MDH’s year-end entries for federal funds.

During FY 2023 MDH worked with DBM and contracted with an
accounting firm to help improve its fiscal practices. MDH also
made adjusting entries to eliminate certain longstanding deficit
balances.

Corrective action is still ongoing and our review of MDH’s FY 2023
closeout transactions noted similar concerns to those in 2022.

Accrued Revenue Transactions (Closeout Finding 1) Repeat Finding
MDH continued to record year-end revenue entries without verifying
that the amounts recorded were valid and collectable. At the end of
fiscal year 2023, MDH recorded 1,221 accrued federal fund revenue
entries totaling approximately $7.9 billion.

Our test of 8 entries totaling $2.5 billion disclosed MDH could not
document that 5 entries (totaling $2.3 billion) accurately reflected
amounts collectable from the federal government or the
subsequent recovery of the funds.

Our analysis disclosed that 408 of the 1,221 entries related to
accounts with no expenditure activity during fiscal year 2023,
including 197 entries that were identical to entries made in one or
more prior fiscal years dating back to 2015.

Other Liabilities (Closeout Finding 6) Repeat Finding
MDH reported $123 million in unprovided for payables and other
general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2023 comprised of the
following:

Disallowed federal fund claims totaling $34.2 million for services
which DDA approved without considering the level of need.

Estimated reimbursements to Medicaid providers for services
rendered during fiscal year 2023 that exceeded MCPA’s
appropriation by $32.8 million.

A potential liability totaling $56 million that must be spent on the
MCPA Money Follows the Person program by September 30, 2025
or returned to the federal government.

Office of Legislative Audits
Other Liabilities (Closeout Finding 7)
MDH did not properly report to the General Accounting Division
unrecoverable federal funds potentially totaling $8.8 million noted in
our October 26, 2022 audit report of DDA.

Although MDH previously advised that these funds were no longer
recoverable due to the age of the expenditures, during the current
closeout review MDH advised that the unrecoverable amount is
less than $8.8 million because certain payments were not eligible
for federal reimbursement.

As of December 2023, MDH was still investigating the matter but
acknowledged that at least some portion of the $8.8 million is
unrecoverable.
