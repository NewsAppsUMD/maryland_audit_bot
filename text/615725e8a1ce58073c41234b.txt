AUDIT FINDING AND RECOMMENDATION
Continue to Develop and Implement Information Security Policies and Procedures
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (First Issued in 2019)
Prior Title: Develop and Implement Information Security Policies and Procedures
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission (Commission) does not have information security
policies and procedures to support its information security program. In addition, the Commission has
not adopted an information security standard. Industry best practices suggest that entities prepare,
disseminate, and maintain information security policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures to
facilitate effective implementation of an information security program.
Without documented and formally approved information security policies and procedures, the
Commission cannot effectively communicate and implement information security requirements to
protect and mitigate risks to sensitive data. Additionally, the Commission may inconsistently address
security needs in the information technology (IT) environment, increasing the potential of unauthorized
access to data and reducing the ability to recover from system outages timely, among other risks.
The Commission has not adopted an information security standard and lacks documented and
approved information security policies and procedures due to a lack of sufficient financial resources to
hire full-time IT personnel. Additionally, the Commission uses outside contractors to help manage and
maintain its IT operations, and the contractors may not understand the Commission’s security needs.
The Commission is currently in discussion with the Virginia Information Technologies Agency
(VITA) for VITA to provide required IT services. The Commission should consider finalizing negotiations
with VITA or dedicate the necessary resources to select a security standard, develop and formally
approve information security policies and procedures, and implement them into their information
security program. Selecting an information security standard and developing and implementing
information security policies and procedures will help to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of data.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
When compared to the previous fiscal year, Commission revenues increased by three percent;
expenses decreased by fifteen percent; and net income increased overall by 178 percent. The
Commission’s revenue increase was due primarily to a new grant from the Maryland Department of
Transportation for moving oyster beds due to construction of a new bridge over the Potomac River.
Expense decreases and the net income increase were primarily due to the absence of oyster plantings
during fiscal year 2021.

Fiscal Year
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission closed fiscal year 2021 with an overall cash balance of $1,362,130 in six different
bank accounts, which was a 27 percent or $287,878 increase, over fiscal year 2020 levels. The cash
balance includes $792,870 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts to fund future oyster
work and supplement operating expenses and $511,865 in a separate Virginia investment pool account
for retiree health care reserves. The remaining three accounts include three operating accounts. The
retiree healthcare account is managed by a trust and legally cannot be used to fund operations. The
Commission earmarked two accounts for the Reserve and Harvest programs, and the Commission no
longer uses these reserves to supplement operating cash. As shown in Chart 2, as of June 30, 2021, the
Commission’s operating cash coverage remains at a positive rate of 9 months coverage of operating
expenses as the Commission continues to restrict contributions to the oyster programs.

The Honorable Ralph S. Northam
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Kenneth R. Plum
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
Commissioners
Potomac River Fisheries Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2021. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commission’s financial system; review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls; test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and review corrective
actions of audit findings from the prior year report.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances.

Information system security
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also tested details of
transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The financial information presented in this report
came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted one matter involving internal control and its operation that requires management’s
attention and corrective action. The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are
required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. The matter is described in the section
entitled “Audit Finding and Recommendation.”
The Commission has not taken adequate corrective action with respect to audit finding reported
in the prior year.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on September 14, 2021. Management’s response to
the finding identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did not
audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
