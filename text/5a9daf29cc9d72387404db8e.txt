Overview of Repeat Audit Findings
(cid:190) OLA issues about 70 fiscal compliance audit
reports each year, containing more than 300
recommendations.
(cid:190) Virtually all recommendations are accepted by
agencies.
(cid:190) As of June 2002, 43% of findings were repeated in
the first subsequent audit report.
(cid:190) As of June 2008, 35% of findings were repeated in
the first subsequent audit report, indicating
improvement since the process was implemented.
(cid:190) As of June 2008, 16% of findings were repeated
after the second subsequent audit.
(cid:190) The goal of the follow-up process is to have
agencies focus on audit issues and increase their
commitment to resolving audit findings by
requiring them to periodically report their
implementation efforts.

Follow-up Process 2002 - 2006
(cid:190) To address the high repeat finding rate, OLA
initiated its first follow-up process in calendar
year 2002.
(cid:190) During the 2002 to 2006 period, status reports
were received from 67 agencies.
(cid:190) 40 agencies reported achieving full or
substantial progress.
(cid:190) The remaining 27 agencies reported that
implementation of the audit recommendations
was still in process.
(cid:190) The subsequent audits generally showed a
reduction in the number of repeat findings for
these agencies.

Follow-up Process October 2006 to Present
(cid:190) Chapter 512, Laws of Maryland 2006,
addressed the issue of repeat audit findings
within the judicial and executive branches.
(cid:190) Agencies with five or more repeat audit findings
are now required, by law, to provide status
reports to OLA on corrective actions taken on all
audit findings within nine months of the related
audit reports.
(cid:190) Updated status reports must be provided
quarterly until OLA determines that satisfactory
progress has been made on all findings, or until
the next audit begins.
(cid:190) The law became effective October 1, 2006.

Results of Current Follow-up Process
(cid:190) To date, 20 agencies have submitted one or
more quarterly reports under the new law to
collectively report the status of 297 audit
findings.
(cid:190) 5 more agencies will be submitting their first
status reports over the next nine months. These
agencies collectively had 50 audit findings.
(cid:190) The status report process has concluded for 10
agencies.

Results of Current Follow-up Process (continued)
(cid:190) For the 10 agencies for which the status report
process has concluded
(cid:131) 3 agencies reported that satisfactory
progress had been achieved on all 34
findings, and
(cid:131) 7 agencies collectively reported that
satisfactory progress had been achieved on
74% of their findings. Although full
compliance had not been achieved, status
reports were discontinued because the
subsequent audits had begun.
(cid:190) The subsequent audits have been completed
for 3 of these 7 agencies.
(cid:190) These subsequent audits generally showed that
agencies’ progress in implementing audit
recommendations was somewhat less than
what was reported.

Conclusion
(cid:190) OLA implemented the new “repeat finding” law
in October 2006. Additional time is needed to
better assess its impact.
(cid:190) Overall results indicate that increased emphasis
on implementing audit recommendations has
been effective.
(cid:190) Since 2002, the percentage of repeat audit
findings has decreased from 43% to 35% in
2008.
(cid:190) OLA will continue to monitor and evaluate the
impact of the repeat finding law on future
audits.
