Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closeout transactions that have not been previously recorded in the
State’s accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR).
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the CAFR. In its
audit report dated December 14, 2018, applicable to the fiscal year ended June 30,
2018, the firm stated that the State’s financial statements presented fairly, in all
material respects, the respective financial position of the State of Maryland as of
June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in the financial position and cash flows,
for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (referred to as GAAP).
The State’s CAFR states that, on a budgetary basis, the General Fund had an
unencumbered balance of approximately $589.6 million as of June 30, 2018. This
represents an increase of approximately $331.0 million from the balance reported
at the preceding fiscal year-end ($258.6 million). The CAFR also states that the
State Reserve (primarily the Revenue Stabilization Account) balance totaled
$883.6 million as of June 30, 2018.
The budgetary General Fund balance does not reflect the effect of year-end
GAAP adjustments made to the State’s financial statements that were prepared on
a modified accrual basis of accounting. Certain GAAP adjustments, if recognized
on the budgetary basis, would have reduced the unencumbered budgetary General
Fund balance of $589.6 million. For example, two GAAP adjustments reduced
the Fund balance by $899.7 million for income tax collections that are owed to
local jurisdictions as of June 30, 2018. These adjustments were a total of $204.6
million less than similar adjustments made for the fiscal year 2017 CAFR. Other
GAAP adjustments totaling $110.6 million were made for general fund liabilities
incurred by State agencies during fiscal year 2018 for which general fund
appropriations were not available to finance the expenditures at the time the
adjustments were reported (see Exhibit 2).

Introduction, Objectives, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2018. This review was conducted under the authority of the
State Government Article, Section 2-1220 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
The objective of our review was to determine whether budget closeout
transactions, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, were properly supported and
made in accordance with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting
policies and to determine if other significant liabilities existed at fiscal year-end.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end transactions, based on our
assessment of risk and materiality, for 18 departments and independent agencies
to ascertain if the transactions were properly supported and made in accordance
with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies and to determine
if other significant liabilities existed at fiscal year-end. We reviewed, on a limited
basis, transactions processed subsequent to June 30, 2018 to determine if the
transactions were properly recorded (such as charged or credited to the proper
fiscal year).
As part of our current review, we contacted various officials of State agencies.
Our review excluded public colleges and universities and transactions processed
through the Transportation Trust Fund because the related financial activity does
not involve the State’s General Fund and/or because agencies have the authority
to retain unspent funds at year-end. Our conclusions for the aforementioned
objective are contained on page 7 of this report.
We also assessed the status of the six issues identified in our January 24, 2018
report entitled Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year
2017. We determined four of the six issues were resolved. The remaining two
issues are repeated in this report (see Exhibit 1).
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
reported. We advised the appropriate agencies of our findings. Formal responses
were not requested since this report contains no recommendations. Our fieldwork
was conducted during the period from July 2018 to January 2019.

Findings
Conclusion
Our review of State agencies’ budget closeout transactions disclosed that such
transactions were generally properly supported and made in accordance with State
budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies. However, we determined
that five departments or agencies were not in compliance primarily because
certain year-end transactions were not properly recorded, could not be
substantiated, or did not comply with budget closeout requirements. Additionally,
we determined that five agencies or departments had significant payables or
liabilities at June 30, 2018 that may require general funds.
Revenue Transactions
Three agencies reported various improper revenue transactions such as
unsubstantiated accruals and retaining funds without proper authority. For
example, one agency recorded unsubstantiated revenues to offset federal fund
deficits. Specifically, the agency recorded federal fund revenues totaling
approximately $6.4 million to cover expenditures even though the revenues are
not likely to be recovered. In addition, one State agency had $1.8 million of
reimbursable fund receivables that is not collectable and an additional $800,000
may not be collected due to length of reimbursement delays. To the extent these
funds are not received, general funds will likely be required to eliminate the
deficits resulting from these transactions.
Expenditure Transactions
One agency did not revert or cancel certain unused general fund appropriations in
accordance with budgetary law language. Specifically, $750,000 in general funds
restricted for the implementation of an opioid risk reduction pilot program was
retained by the agency even though the program was not implemented.
Other Liabilities
Four agencies or departments reported a total of $110.6 million in unprovided for
general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2018. For
example, one agency, which had a similar issue in our three preceding closeout
reports, may require general funds of approximately $34.2 million to cover an
unfunded liability attributable to the disallowance of certain claims. Furthermore,
another agency had a potential $28.4 million liability to the federal government
related to certain misallocated expenditures.
According to an opinion of the Attorney General, unprovided for payables are not
a violation of State law if the General Assembly enacts a budget bill for the
7

--- Page 10 ---
subsequent year containing an appropriation that can be used to fund these
expenditures.
A summary of our findings, by agency, is included in Exhibit 1.
Revenue Transactions
Finding 1
Federal fund revenues totaling approximately $6.4 million recorded by one
agency at fiscal year-end are not likely to be recovered.
Analysis
The Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation (DLLR) had
unsubstantiated accrued federal fund revenues totaling $6.4 million. These
accrued revenues related to the recovery of past DLLR indirect costs to administer
certain federal programs. Consequently, general funds (such as a deficiency
appropriation) may be needed to the extent federal funds are not available for
DLLR’s indirect costs.
The recordation of these unsubstantiated federal fund revenues was previously
disclosed in our Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal
Year 2016 and 2017 reports dated January 25, 2017 and January 24, 2018,
respectively, and our fiscal compliance audit report on the DLLR’s Office of the
Secretary dated August 7, 2017. We continue to note that there is no indication of
forthcoming federal approval to recover these costs.
Finding 2
Reimbursable fund revenues totaling $1.8 million recorded by one agency at
fiscal year-end are not collectable and recovery of an additional $800,000 is
uncertain.
Analysis
The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) had unsubstantiated
accrued reimbursable fund revenues totaling $1.8 million that are not collectable
and recovery of an additional $800,000 is uncertain. These accrued revenues
related to the recovery of costs incurred (accounts receivable) for DoIT’s
oversight of information technology projects dating back to fiscal year 2011.
DoIT recorded revenue accruals totaling $1.4 million for unpaid obligations from
other State agencies from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2015 and another $1.2
million for fiscal year 2016. After our inquiries regarding the support for the
8

--- Page 11 ---
collectability of the accruals, DoIT officials informed us that the $1.4 million and
a portion of the $1.2 million ($400,000) should be deemed uncollectable. Our
review to determine if DoIT had collected any revenues relating to the fiscal year
2016 accrual found that no revenues had been collected as of January 3, 2019.
Because of the length of the reimbursement delays, the extent to which the
amounts outstanding will be received is uncertain. If DoIT is unable to recover
these funds, general funds may be needed to eliminate the resulting deficits.
Finding 3
One agency retained $173,000 in funds without legal authority, in order to
reduce an $830,000 special fund deficit.
Analysis
The Department of State Police (DSP) retained $173,000 in funds collected for
the salvage vehicle inspection program, without legal authority, in order to reduce
an $830,000 special fund deficit. After retaining the funds, DSP recorded special
fund revenue accruals totaling $657,000 at June 30, 2018 to eliminate a remaining
special fund deficit balance without regard to the ultimate collectability of those
revenues. We were advised that this deficit was the result of DSP’s efforts to
address unexplained deficit special fund balances identified in our fiscal
compliance audit report dated November 23, 2015.
In fiscal year 2017, DSP began recording salvage vehicle inspection program
activity (revenues and expenditures) to this fund, with the intent of using it as a
source to eventually eliminate the deficit special fund balance, even though the
program activity could not be specifically linked to the special fund. For
example, during fiscal year 2018, salvage vehicle inspection program revenues
exceeded expenditures by approximately $173,000. DSP applied the $173,000
surplus to the deficit special fund balance, which reduced the June 30, 2018
deficit balance to the aforementioned $657,000. State law does not identify
salvage vehicle inspection program revenue as special non-lapsing funds.
Finding 4
One agency did not revert non-budgeted funds totaling $821,000 to the
State’s General Fund at year-end.
Analysis
DSP did not revert non-budgeted funds totaling $821,000 to the State’s General
Fund at year-end. Specifically, DSP did not determine the composition of a non-
budgeted fund clearing account’s June 30, 2018 balance or the proper disposition
9

--- Page 12 ---
of the funds. DSP could not explain the fund’s intended purpose, and minimal
activity was recorded to the fund during fiscal years 2015 through 2018. If the
disposition of the funds cannot be determined, DSP should revert the funds to the
State’s General Fund, or if determined to be permissible, request an appropriation
to use the funds.
The closing instructions issued by the Comptroller of Maryland – General
Accounting Division (GAD) require clearing accounts with positive year-end
balances to be reported to GAD and that clearing accounts exceeding $100,000 be
analyzed and adjusted to a zero balance. As of November 15, 2018, DSP had not
reported the balance in the non-budgeted fund clearing account to GAD.
Expenditure Transactions
Finding 5
One agency did not revert or cancel certain unused general fund
appropriations in accordance with budgetary law language.
Analysis
The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) did not implement an opioid risk
reduction pilot program as required by budgetary law language nor revert or
cancel the related general fund appropriation. Chapter 150, Laws of Maryland,
2017 provided that $750,000 of the fiscal year 2018 appropriation made for
medical care provider reimbursements may not be spent for that purpose and
instead shall be expended only to implement an opioid risk reduction pilot
program. Funding not used for this restricted purpose may not be transferred or
otherwise expended and shall revert to the General Fund and/or be cancelled.
We were advised by MDH that the pilot program was not implemented, and we
found that rather than revert or cancel the $750,000 appropriation, during the
fiscal year 2018 budgetary closeout process, MDH accrued all of the remaining
medical care provider reimbursement general fund appropriations for services
provided for in fiscal year 2018 that had not yet been paid. MDH advised us that
it intended to revert $750,000 of its year-end accrued appropriation as part of the
fiscal year 2019 year-end closeout process.

Other Liabilities
Finding 6
Four agencies or departments reported a total of $110.6 million in
unprovided for general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of
June 30, 2018, although there are indications based on subsequent financial
reporting that for one agency, the actual unprovided for amount could be
lower by several million dollars than reported.
Analysis
Four agencies or departments reported a total of $110.6 million in unprovided for
general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2018 (see
Exhibit 2), although there are indications that the amount reported by one agency
could be actually lower by several million dollars. The actual expenditures
related to these liabilities may have to be funded with subsequent year
appropriations (or through a deficiency appropriation).
For example, at fiscal year-end, MDH reported estimated unprovided for payables
and other general fund liabilities totaling $104.1 million.1 Although MDH
reported unprovided for payables which totaled $68.7 million to GAD, there are
indications based on subsequent financial reporting that the unprovided for
payables may be several million dollars less than originally reported (the amount
cannot be reasonably determined at this time). Additionally, MDH reported a
liability to the federal government of approximately $34.2 million for a
disallowed claims related to Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA)
residential habilitation add-on services under its Community Pathways waiver
program (a Medicaid funded program). The federal Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) – Office of the Inspector General (OIG), in its June 2015
audit report, disallowed these claims and recommended that DDA refund the
overbilled amount to the federal HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS).
In MDH’s September 24, 2015 response to the audit report and to CMS, MDH
disagreed with the OIG’s interpretation of waiver requirements and urged CMS to
reconsider requiring MDH to refund the $34.2 million in disallowed claims. In a
letter dated June 26, 2018, CMS issued a formal disallowance letter requiring the
refund of the identified $34.2 million. On August 23, 2018, MDH issued a
Request for Reconsideration letter to HHS to begin the appeals process related to
CMS' determination. The CMS disallowance letter provided that MDH could
1 MDH reported the potential liabilities of $104.1 million to GAD, and GAD recorded a decrease
to the General Fund in the State’s fiscal year 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report to
recognize these disallowances.
11

--- Page 14 ---
elect to either retain or return the funds in question during the appeals process;
however, should HHS confirm CMS' decision, any amount retained by MDH
would be subject to interest. MDH's Request for Reconsideration, stated that it
had elected to retain the funds during the appeals process; therefore, dependent on
the HHS’ final determination, MDH could be liable to refund the federal
government the original $34.2 million in disallowed claims and any accrued
interest.
Furthermore, in our DDA fiscal compliance audit report dated November 18,
2016 we disclosed that DDA had improperly instructed providers to collect fees
from consumers to contribute to their cost of care, referred to as Contribution to
Care, that otherwise would have been paid from State and federal funds. The
annual improperly collected fees were estimated to be $4.2 million. In fiscal year
2018, DDA recorded $3.0 million of accrued expenditures to partially cover the
refund of one year’s fees to consumers. However, the remaining $1.2 million was
reported as a liability.
Comments regarding similar federal disallowances were made in our three
preceding budgetary closeout reports.
Finding 7
We identified one agency that had a potential $28.4 million liability to the
federal government related to certain misallocated expenditures.
Analysis
The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE) had a potential liability to
the federal government related to certain misallocated expenditures. Specifically,
MHBE did not report a potential federal liability totaling approximately $28.4
million to GAD. In March 2015 the federal Department of Health and Human
Services – Office of the Inspector General (HHS - OIG) released a report on the
audit of establishment grants for Maryland’s Health Insurance Marketplace (that
is, MHBE) that recommended that MDH refund $28.4 million of misallocated
expenditures (MDH was the lead agency responsible for the Maryland
marketplace establishment grants and responsible for complying with applicable
federal requirements). Since the inception of MHBE, MDH has processed grant
allocation and reimbursement requests on its behalf. MDH and MHBE responded
to the federal report that the State did not concur with the findings and
recommendations to repay the $28.4 million. However, after considering the
response, HHS-OIG concluded that all of its findings/recommendations were
valid.
12

--- Page 15 ---
In July 2018, the HHS-OIG released an annual report of the top unimplemented
HHS-OIG recommendations that would most positively affect HHS programs in
terms of cost savings, program effectiveness and efficiency, and public health
safety. This report included the outstanding refund due from MHBE of the $28.4
million of misallocated expenses noted in the aforementioned report. At the time
of our review, we were unable to obtain any further clarifying documentation
from HHS-OIG, MDH, or MHBE on this issue (beyond the July 2018 HHS-OIG
report). However, neither MDH nor MHBE reported the $28.4 million liability to
GAD, and MHBE advised us that it believes the potential liability will be resolved
without the need for State funds. Depending on the resolution of this issue, State
general funds may be needed to repay the federal government.
