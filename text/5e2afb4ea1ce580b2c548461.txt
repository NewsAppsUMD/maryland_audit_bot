Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closeout transactions that have not been previously recorded in the
State’s accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR).
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the CAFR. In its
audit report dated December 16, 2019, applicable to the fiscal year ended June 30,
2019, the firm stated that the State’s financial statements presented fairly, in all
material respects, the respective financial position of the State of Maryland as of
June 30, 2019, and the respective changes in the financial position and cash flows,
for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (referred to as GAAP).
The State’s CAFR states that, on a budgetary basis, the General Fund had an
unencumbered balance of approximately $974.2 million as of June 30, 2019. This
represents an increase of approximately $384.6 million from the balance reported
at the preceding fiscal year-end ($589.6 million). The CAFR also states that the
State Reserve (primarily the Revenue Stabilization Account) balance totaled
$890.7 million as of June 30, 2019.
The budgetary General Fund balance does not reflect the effect of year-end
GAAP adjustments made to the State’s financial statements that were prepared on
a modified accrual basis of accounting. Certain GAAP adjustments, if recognized
on the budgetary basis, would have reduced the unencumbered budgetary General
Fund balance of $974.2 million. For example, two GAAP adjustments reduced
the Fund balance by $1.0 billion for income tax collections that are owed to local
jurisdictions as of June 30, 2019. These adjustments were a total of $104.6
million greater than similar adjustments made for the fiscal year 2018 CAFR.
Four agencies or departments reported a total of $92.5 million in unprovided for
general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2019 (see
Exhibit 2). GAD recorded GAAP adjustments for certain of these liabilities for
which general fund appropriations were not available to finance the expenditures
at the time the adjustments were reported (see Exhibit 2).

Introduction, Objectives, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2019. This review was conducted under the authority of the
State Government Article, Section 2-1220 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
The objective of our review was to determine whether budget closeout
transactions, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, were properly supported and
made in accordance with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting
policies and to determine if other significant liabilities existed at fiscal year-end.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end transactions, based on our
assessment of risk and materiality, for 15 departments and independent agencies
to ascertain if the transactions were properly supported and made in accordance
with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies and to determine
if other significant liabilities existed at fiscal year-end. We reviewed, on a limited
basis, transactions processed subsequent to June 30, 2019 to determine if the
transactions were properly recorded (such as charged or credited to the proper
fiscal year).
As part of our current review, we contacted various officials of State agencies.
Our review excluded public colleges and universities and transactions processed
through the Transportation Trust Fund because the related financial activity does
not involve the State’s General Fund and/or because agencies have the authority
to retain unspent funds at year-end. Our conclusions for the aforementioned
objective are contained on page 7 of this report.
We also assessed the status of the seven issues identified in our January 15, 2019
report entitled Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year
2018. We determined five of the seven issues were resolved. The remaining two
issues are repeated in this report (see Exhibit 1).
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
reported. We advised the appropriate agencies of our findings. Formal responses
were not requested since this report contains no recommendations. Our fieldwork
was conducted during the period from September 2019 to January 2020.

Findings
Conclusion
Our review of State agencies’ budget closeout transactions disclosed that such
transactions were generally properly supported and made in accordance with State
budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies. However, we determined
that four departments or agencies were not in compliance primarily because
certain year-end transactions were not properly recorded, could not be
substantiated, or did not comply with budget closeout requirements. Additionally,
we determined that four agencies or departments had significant payables or
liabilities at June 30, 2019 that may require general funds.
Revenue Transactions
In the prior closeout report, we commented that one department had recorded
unsubstantiated revenues to offset federal fund deficits. Specifically, the
department recorded federal fund revenues totaling approximately $6.4 million to
cover certain expenditures. The department has now determined that these
revenues are not likely to be recovered. Although the department has advised the
Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division of its plan to fund these
expenditures using future sources of revenue, to the extent these funds are not
received, general funds will be required to eliminate the deficits resulting from
these transactions.
Expenditure Transactions
One department recorded unsubstantiated accrued expenditures totaling $420,436
for which goods or services had not been received.
Special Funds
One department retained $569,000 in special funds without legal authority. Since
the department did not have authority to retain the funds, the funds should have
been reverted to the State’s General Fund. One other department had a year-end
special fund deficit balance totaling $485,000.
Other Liabilities
Four agencies or departments reported a total of $92.5 million in unprovided for
general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2019. For
example, one agency, which had a similar issue in our four preceding closeout
reports, may require general funds of approximately $34.2 million to cover an
unfunded liability attributable to the disallowance of certain federal
reimbursement claims. Furthermore, another agency had a potential $28.4 million
liability to the federal government related to certain misallocated expenditures.

--- Page 10 ---
According to an opinion of the Attorney General, unprovided for payables are not
a violation of State law if the General Assembly enacts a budget bill for the
subsequent year containing an appropriation that can be used to fund these
expenditures.
Other Issues
One department potentially overspent fiscal year 2019 appropriated funding for
one program and additional general funds may be needed to eliminate any
resultant deficit.
A summary of our findings, by agency, is included in Exhibit 1.
Revenue Transactions
Finding 1
The Maryland Department of Labor has determined that $6,375,000 in
previously recorded federal fund revenues have now been deemed
unrecoverable.
Analysis
Our January 15, 2019 report on the Statewide Review of Budget Closeout
Transactions for Fiscal Year 2018 noted that the Department of Labor, Licensing,
and Regulation, now the Maryland Department of Labor (MDL)1, had
unsubstantiated accrued federal fund revenues totaling $6.4 million. That report
further noted that these accrued revenues related to the projected recovery of past
indirect costs incurred to administer certain federal programs, but also stated that
general funds may be needed to the extent federal funds are not available for these
costs.
During our current closeout review, MDL advised us that these costs have since
been deemed unrecoverable by MDL. In an August 14, 2018 letter to the
Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) confirming the
unrecoverable nature of the costs, MDL indicated that it will offset these
unrecovered costs over several years by an indirect cost surcharge to most MDL
programs of up to $500,000 per year until recovered. The funding source was
anticipated to be split between general funds and special funds from MDL’s
Special Administrative Expense Fund. During fiscal year 2019, MDL advised us
that $25,000 had been applied reducing the unrecoverable amount to $6,375,000.
1 Chapter 91, Laws of Maryland 2019, effective July 1, 2019, renamed the Department of Labor,
Licensing and Regulation to the Maryland Department of Labor.

--- Page 11 ---
However, during the current closeout review, neither MDL nor GAD were able to
specifically identify the remaining debt of $6,375,000 in State records, although
MDL management contends that it existed and will be subject to future reduction,
using the method previously described.
The recording of these unsubstantiated federal fund revenues was also disclosed
in our Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2016
and 2017 dated January 25, 2017 and January 24, 2018, respectively, and our
fiscal compliance audit report on the Department of Labor, Licensing and
Regulation’s Office of the Secretary dated August 7, 2017.
Expenditure Transactions
Finding 2
The Maryland Department of Health improperly recorded certain
expenditures on behalf of the Opioid Operational Command Center (OOCC)
retaining general fund appropriations for future years.
Analysis
The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) improperly recorded certain
expenditures at the end of fiscal year 2019, on behalf of OOCC, allowing general
fund appropriations to be retained for future years. Specifically, expenditures
totaling $420,436 were accrued at year-end although no goods or services had
been received. This practice violated GAD’s annual closing instructions since the
reported expenditures did not represent actual expenditures for goods or services
received during fiscal year 2019 that remained outstanding (or unpaid) as of fiscal
year-end. GAD’s annual closing instructions state that all fund balances carried
into the next fiscal year be done so in accordance with State statute, regulation, or
policy. The State Policy on Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenditures, and
Encumbrances, which is included in the closing instructions, states that
expenditures should be accrued only when goods or services have been received
prior to fiscal year-end, but not invoiced.

Special Funds
Finding 3
The Maryland State Department of Education retained $569,000 in special
funds without legal authority.
Analysis
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) retained $569,000 in
special funds, primarily collected for Medical Assistance Administration
Recoveries, without legal authority. This includes balances carried over from
fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2019. Although MSDE reported the balance
to GAD as exempt from reversion to the State’s General Fund, MSDE did not
have legal authority to retain the funds (that is, the funds were not exempt from
reversion).
Finding 4
The Department of the State Police had a year-end special fund deficit
balance totaling $485,000.
Analysis
The Department of State Police (DSP) had a special fund deficit totaling
approximately $485,000 within its Operations Bureau at June 30, 2019. We were
advised that this deficit amount was the remainder after DSP’s efforts to address
long-standing unexplained deficit special fund balances first identified in our
fiscal compliance audit report dated November 23, 2015. Since then, the deficit
has been reported in our subsequent budgetary closeout reports and our fiscal
compliance audit report dated September 23, 2019. In the June 30, 2018 closeout
report (and the September 23, 2019 fiscal compliance report), we noted that the
deficit as of June 30, 2018 was $657,000, and that DSP had retained, without
legal authority, $173,000 in funds collected for the salvage vehicle inspection
program to reduce the deficit from a previous balance of $830,000. At that time,
DSP had not consulted with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)
regarding the use of these collections to assist in resolving the deficit, and State
law does not identify revenue from the salvage vehicle inspection program as
special non-lapsing funds.
For fiscal year 2019, DSP again used funds ($172,000) collected for the salvage
vehicle inspection program to reduce the year-end deficit from $657,000 to
$485,000. However, during our current review, DBM confirmed to us that it had
authorized DSP to use collections for the inspection program to reduce the deficit.
DBM also advised DSP that, as part of the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle, it would
10

--- Page 13 ---
work with DSP to consider the best way to address the remaining deficit balance
going forward.
Other Liabilities
Finding 5
Four agencies or departments reported a total of $92.5 million in unprovided
for general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2019.
Analysis
Four agencies or departments reported a total of $92.5 million in unprovided for
general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2019 (see
Exhibit 2). The actual expenditures related to these liabilities may have to be
funded with subsequent year appropriations (or through a deficiency
appropriation).
The largest amount of fiscal year-end unprovided for payables related to MDH,
which reported estimated unprovided for payables and other general fund
liabilities totaling $58.8 million. This amount consists of three different
components, including a liability to the federal government of approximately
$34.2 million for disallowed claims related to Developmental Disabilities
Administration (DDA) residential habilitation add-on services under its
Community Pathways waiver program (a Medicaid funded program). The federal
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – Office of the Inspector
General (OIG), in its June 2015 audit report, disallowed these DDA claims and
recommended that DDA refund the overbilled amount to the federal HHS -
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
In MDH’s September 24, 2015 response to the audit report and to CMS, MDH
disagreed with the OIG’s interpretation of waiver requirements and urged CMS to
reconsider requiring MDH to refund the $34.2 million in disallowed claims. In a
letter dated June 26, 2018, CMS issued a formal disallowance letter requiring the
refund of the identified $34.2 million. On August 23, 2018, MDH issued a
Request for Reconsideration letter to HHS to begin the appeals process related to
CMS’ determination. The CMS disallowance letter provided that MDH could
elect to either retain or return the funds in question during the appeals process;
however, should HHS confirm CMS’ decision, any amount retained by MDH
would be subject to interest. MDH’s Request for Reconsideration, stated that it
had elected to retain the funds during the appeals process; therefore, depending on
HHS’ final determination, MDH could be required to pay the federal government
the original $34.2 million in disallowed claims and any accrued interest. Since the
11

--- Page 14 ---
August 2018 Request for Reconsideration letter, there has been no further action
or correspondence regarding HHS’ final determination.
Comments regarding similar federal claims disallowances were made in our four
preceding Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions reports.
Furthermore, MDH also reported an additional liability to the federal government
of approximately $20.9 million for an obligation relating to the Rebalancing Fund
Demonstration which is associated with the Medical Care Programs
Administration Money Follows the Person (MFP) program. The MFP
Rebalancing Fund Demonstration is a part of a comprehensive, coordinated
strategy by CMS to assist States, in collaboration with stakeholders, to make
widespread changes to their long-term care support systems. A major objective of
the MFP Rebalancing Fund Demonstration is to increase the use of home and
community-based services rather than institutional, long-term care services.
By participating in the Rebalancing Fund Demonstration, the State agreed to
accept federal funds covering 75 percent of its MFP program expenditures, with
the remaining 25 percent supported by State funds, instead of the more traditional
50/50 funding split used in many other federal programs. However, the 25
percent savings that the State realized from the enhanced federal reimbursement
rate is required to be spent on additional MFP program expenditures and not used
for other purposes. The aforementioned $20.9 million represents this enhanced
funding for which the required additional MFP expenditures had not been made as
of June 30, 2019.
The Rebalancing Fund Demonstration was to end June 30, 2019, however CMS
extended the program until September 30, 2020. As of December 19, 2019, MDH
had no further updates on whether the Rebalancing Fund Demonstration program
would be extended beyond its current end date of September 30, 2020, nor could
MDH provide guidance on what, if any, actions the federal government may take
if MDH has not satisfied the aforementioned program requirements by that date.
However, GAD did not record this amount as a liability since it is in fact a
contingent liability, as federal funds remain available to fund the liability.
Specifically, MDH continues to have an opportunity to expend the grant funds
through September 30, 2020. The actual liability, if any, will not be determined
until after the close of the project period.
Another agency, the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE), had a $28.4
million potential liability to the federal government related to an audit finding by
the HHS – OIG of certain misallocated expenditures. This issue was detailed
further in finding seven of our January 15, 2019 report on the Statewide Review of
12

--- Page 15 ---
Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2018. In a letter dated September
1, 2019 to the Chairs of the Senate Budget and Taxation and House
Appropriations Committees, MHBE noted that the HHS – Office of General
Counsel had recommended that MHBE rely on a previous determination by HHS’
CMS that MHBE followed CMS’ guidance when allocating establishment grant
expenditures. However the letter also stated that, in response to MHBE’s
inquiries regarding the status of this matter, MHBE was advised that no formal
resolution was yet available.
Other Issues
Finding 6
MSDE potentially overspent fiscal year 2019 appropriated funding for its
Students with Disabilities – Aid to Education program.
Analysis
MSDE potentially overspent fiscal year 2019 appropriated funding for its
Students with Disabilities – Aid to Education program. During the year-end
closeout process, after allowing for certain recorded encumbrances related to the
program, MSDE anticipated sufficient appropriated funds to cover the related
expenditures in the program that had been incurred but not paid as of June 30,
2019. However, subsequent to the year-end close process and over the
intervening six months, funding now appears to be inadequate, as our review
determined that as of January 14, 2020, MSDE has obligated funds that exceeded
its fiscal year 2019 appropriations by approximately $1.1 million.
Consequentially, depending on the action taken and dollar activity involved,
additional State general funds may be needed to eliminate any resultant deficit.
