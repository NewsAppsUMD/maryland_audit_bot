Reports Recommended for Committee Action
November 16, 2021 to October 31, 2022
The following audit reports have been recommended for follow-up action by the Joint
Audit and Evaluation Committee (JAEC). The basis of the recommendation could
include the number and significance of the audit findings, the agency receiving an
“unsatisfactory” rating (which will necessitate future OLA follow-up), and/or contentious
or controversial issues that remain unresolved or have related recommendations in a
state of implementation (that is, are “in–progress” by the agency). The determination of
whether to recommend a JAEC follow-up letter (letter of concern) or hearing, is based
on a subjective determination by the OLA using professional judgment. The purpose of
a “follow-up letter” from the Committee is to convey the Legislature’s formal concern
and reinforce the Committee’s commitment to ensure appropriate accountability is
established (via the audit recommendations) for those audits or findings that do not rise
to the level of a hearing.
1) Maryland Department of Health – Regulatory Services (1/19/21 – 7 findings,
including a number of repeats)
2) Baltimore City Community College (2/09/22 – 8 findings)
3) Department of Human Services – Social Services Administration – Follow-up
Review (of Unsatisfactory Audit Report) (Special Reports and Letters) (7/06/22)
4) Maryland Department of Health – Developmental Disabilities Administration
(DDA) (10/26/22 – 8 findings, including a number of repeats; DDA’s
accountability and compliance level remains unsatisfactory due to significance
of audit findings)
