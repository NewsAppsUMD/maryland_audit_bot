AGENCY HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership
consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
The Commission has the following responsibilities:
1. Adopting the rules and regulations for the recreational and commercial taking or catching
of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams from the Potomac River;
2. Issuing licenses for the taking or catching of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams and for
boats, vessels, and related equipment;
3. Imposing an inspection tax on oysters caught in the Potomac River; and
4. Reseeding and replanting oyster bars.
The Commission’s regulations carry the full force and effect of law, and the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission jointly enforce the regulations.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the following
sources.
2011 2010
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 175,000
Federal grant 109,348 79,495
Sport fishing licenses 129,528 109,615
Commercial fishing licenses 76,215 76,185
Commercial crab licenses 71,825 72,870
Commercial oyster licenses 3,695 3,945
Commercial clam licenses - -
Oyster bushel tax 209 401
Interest and miscellaneous 15,406 15,808
Total revenue $694,976 $682,069
The Commission saw a slight increase in total revenue for fiscal year 2011, which was the net result
of a decrease in Maryland’s appropriations with increases in the sales of licenses and additional grant funding
from the Atlantic Coast Fisheries Cooperative Management Act grant. The Commission performed more
work on this federal grant in fiscal year 2011, resulting in the additional funding from the grant.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:
2011 2010
Personnel services $375,857 $363,228
Federal grant 106,772 74,730
Contractual services 77,266 86,901
Development and repletion - 8,774
Materials and supplies 46,482 46,192
Insurance 6,846 6,629
Fixed assets 2,901 5,846
Operating Expenses 616,124 592,300
Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Oyster development 15,000 100,000
Retiree health care 50,000 50,000
Reserve Expenses 65,000 150,000
Total Expenses $681,124 $742,300
Operating expenses increased by $23,824 from fiscal year 2010. The increase is mainly due to
increased Federal grants to support fish sampling. Personnel expenses increased due to the December 2010
three percent bonus and leave payouts for retiring personnel. Contractual service expenses decreased due to
funding certain fish studies with Federal grants rather than general operating funds in fiscal year 2011. Other
expense categories remained relatively unchanged.
In addition, the Commission continues to retain funds in order to support future oyster work in the
Potomac River and support retiree health care costs. The Commission is attempting to determine the best way
to develop a self-sustaining oyster industry in the Potomac, and they intend to use reserve funds to support
this cause.
The Commission changed its method of funding health insurance benefits. Traditionally, the
Commission provided 80 percent of the health insurance cost for employees and employees contributed 20
percent. The Board adopted a resolution in June 2010 for the employees to contribute 90 percent of the cost
and the Commission would pay 10 percent of the cost for 36 months. The benefit to the employee is a salary
increase, which not only defrays the cost of the additional 70 percent insurance deduction but also augments
the employee’s salary for retirement benefit analysis, which has a net zero cost to the Commission.
During fiscal year 2011, the Commission set aside an additional $15,000 to fund future oyster work
and $50,000 to fund retiree health insurance. The chart on the next page shows the continued growth of the
reserve funds for use in future fiscal years. Interest accrues on these accounts at the market rate.

The Commission closed fiscal year 2011 with an operating gain of $78,852. After factoring in the
reserve expense of $65,000, the Commission’s operating gain was $13,852.
The ability of the Commission to continue to retain more cash each year is due to the fact that they
performed no major projects in either fiscal year 2010 or 2011. The Commission closed fiscal year 2011 with
a cash balance of $358,889 to include $155,500 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts and a
separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree health care reserves, with a balance of $125,828 as of
June 30, 2011.

The Honorable Robert F. McDonnell
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Charles J. Colgan
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission
for the year ended June 30, 2011. We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our
audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions in the
Commission’s accounting system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls, and test compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal control
and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and
efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual, sufficient to
plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of our audit
procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of transactions,
and account balances.
Capital assets Cash receipting
Contractual services expenses License revenues
Payroll expenses Federal grant revenues and expenses
Appropriations
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had been placed
in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with provisions of applicable
laws and regulations. Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents,

records, and contracts, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We tested transactions and performed
analytical procedures, including budgetary and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded and reported
in the Commission’s accounting system. The Commission records its financial transactions on the cash basis of
accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The financial information presented in this report came directly from the
Commission’s accounting system.
We noted no matters involving internal control and its operation that we consider necessary to be reported
to management. The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations disclosed no instances
of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on May 21, 2012.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly, management,
and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the state of Maryland and is a public record.
