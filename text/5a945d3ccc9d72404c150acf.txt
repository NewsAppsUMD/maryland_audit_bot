Introduction and Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires each county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in
Maryland to file annual (or once every four years under specified conditions)
audit reports. There were 194 local government audit reports due for our fiscal
year 2015 review (25 counties, 155 cities and towns, and 14 taxing districts). The
reports are to include financial statements, with accompanying notes, and
auditors’ reports that express opinions as to whether the financial statements are
fairly presented. The financial statements are required to be prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and audited in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. We have prepared and
distributed audit guidelines to provide additional information regarding the
accounting, reporting, and auditing requirements.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-307 of the Code requires the Office of
Legislative Audits to perform a desk review of each local government’s annual
audit report for compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and
auditing standards. As part of the desk review process, we also addressed other
attributes as described below. Section 16-308 of the Article specifies the
reporting and review requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by
the counties. The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special
taxing district’s compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for
submitting the districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is
required to review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2015 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as four fiscal year 2014 reports (Baltimore City, City of Glenarden, City of
Hyattsville, and Town of Morningside) and three fiscal year 2013 reports (City of
Glenarden, City of Hyattsville, and Town of Morningside). The desk reviews
consisted of reading each audit report in order to accomplish the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and certain
accounting and auditing standards pertaining to the presentation of the
financial statements and auditors’ reports.
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits, timely filing of audit reports).
5

--- Page 8 ---
 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances or unfavorable trends and ratios, based on analyses of financial
data over the most recent five-year period (July 1, 2010 through June 30,
2015).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2015 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.
At the conclusion of our review, letters are sent to applicable local governments
and their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies disclosed during
the review so that corrective actions can be taken to help ensure future
compliance. Additionally, as appropriate, letters are also sent to local
governments, and to their legislative representatives, to communicate
noncompliance with State law or potential financial problems. For these issues,
the local governments are asked to advise us of corrective actions that will be
taken.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
Finding 1
A number of local governments had not filed the required audit reports or
had filed after the required filing date.
As of July 29, 2016, two local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal
years 2013, 2014, and 2015, and seven other local governments had not filed audit
reports for fiscal year 2015. Furthermore, 31 local governments submitted audit
reports after the required filing date. The submission of audit reports after the
required filing date was also noted for 11 of these 31 local governments during
our preceding year’s review. The failure of a local government to file an audit
report, or a delay in filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its
citizens. The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code
of Maryland generally requires audit reports to be filed on or before October 31
after the close of the fiscal year or on or before December 31 after the close of the
fiscal year for those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, June 30, 2014, and June
30, 2015 had not been received, as of July 29, 2016, for the Town of Deer Park
and the Town of Marydel. Budget language adopted during the 2016 Session of
the Maryland General Assembly (Chapter 143, 2016 Laws of Maryland) has
resulted in the withholding of certain transportation aid from these two local
governments pending receipt of their audit reports for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and
2015. Furthermore, failure to file a required report with the Department of
Legislative Services for three successive years provides the Executive Director
with reasonable cause to suppose that the municipality is no longer actively
operating under its charter which could cause these towns to have their charter
repealed. The failure of these two local governments to submit audit reports has
been reported to the Executive Director.
Additionally, audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 had not been
received, as of July 29, 2016, for the following seven governments:
1. Baltimore City
2. City of Glenarden
3. City of Hyattsville
4. Town of Morningside
5. City of Mount Rainier
6. Bel Air Special Taxing Area
7

--- Page 10 ---
7. Mount Savage Special Taxing Area
Budget language adopted during the 2016 session of the Maryland General
Assembly provided that $1.0 million appropriated for the purpose of a disparity
grant to Baltimore City not be expended until the City submits its fiscal year 2015
and 2016 audit reports to the Department of Legislative Services.
Subsequently, the City of Mount Rainier submitted its audit report for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2015. We will review all fiscal year 2013, 2014, and 2015
audit reports and take any follow-up action necessary when the reports are
received. The results of these reviews will be included in the report on our review
of fiscal year 2016 local government audit reports.
The towns of Barclay, Brookview, Church Creek, Eldorado, Galestown,
Goldsboro, Henderson, Highland Beach, Hillsboro, Mardela Springs, Port
Tobacco, Queen Anne and Templeville had previously requested and were
granted waivers from filing audit reports. These local governments met the
conditions for filing an audit report every fourth year as provided for under the
Local Government Article, Section 16-305 of the Code and, depending on the
waiver period, will be required to file its next audit report for either fiscal year
2016, 2017, or 2018.
Finding 2
The auditor’s report for one local government contained an adverse opinion
on one opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit, and one
other local government auditor’s report contained a qualified opinion on one
opinion unit.
The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion on one
opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit and one other local
government report contained a qualified opinion on a certain opinion unit. The
following is a summary of these opinions.
The auditor’s report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion (a
statement that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles) on the discretely presented component
unit opinion unit because of the omission of financial data for the Town’s
component unit. Specifically, financial data related to a development corporation
that is a component unit of the Town had not been audited and was not included
in the Town’s financial statement.
8

--- Page 11 ---
The Town’s audit report also contained a qualified opinion (a statement that,
except for the effects of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial
statements are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles) on the governmental activities opinion unit because the Town had not
measured the effect of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
49 entitled “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation
Obligations.” According to the report, certain buildings of the development
corporation contained asbestos and, although deemed improbable, the Town could
become liable for the cost of abatement.
As a result, the Town’s financial statements were not presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required by State law. The
Town’s audit reports for each fiscal year since 2009 also contained an adverse
opinion and a qualified opinion due to these situations.
The audit report for Baltimore City for fiscal year 2014 contained a qualified
opinion on the City’s Grant Revenue Fund opinion unit because, the auditor was
unable to obtain sufficient evidential matter that supported approximately $24
million of the unearned revenue reported in the fund.
Although required by our audit guidelines, the auditors for the Baltimore City did
not submit a separate letter to the Office of Legislative Audits explaining the
reason for the qualified opinion, and the City’s plans to rectify the problem to
enable the auditors to express an unqualified opinion in the future. Subsequently,
we spoke with a representative of Baltimore City who stated that the City was
working to rectify the situation. The auditor for the Town of Sykesville submitted
a letter providing explanations regarding the opinions that were not unqualified as
required, but the resolution of the applicable conditions is uncertain.
Finding 3
Auditors’ reports for eight local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for eight local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards. The following is a
summary of these deficiencies:
9

--- Page 12 ---
Number of
Area of Noncompliance
Audit Reports
Auditor’s report did not report on all required 5
information (for example, supplemental information
accompanying the basic financial statements).
Auditor’s report did not include all basic elements (for 2
example, auditor did not include explanatory
language related to the omission of certain
information).
Auditor did not express an opinion on all opinion units. 1
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires that audits be performed in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. These standards require, in part, that the auditor express an
opinion(s) as to whether the basic financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the respective financial position, the respective changes in
financial position, and cash flows, where applicable, of the local government in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Financial Statements
Finding 4
Financial statements submitted by 19 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 19 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of three of these local governments included two such deficiencies and
the financial statements of one of these local governments included three such
deficiencies. Furthermore, the financial statements of 3 of these 19 local
governments included one or more deficiencies that were also cited during our
preceding year’s review. The following is a summary of the deficiencies and the
corresponding number of instances:
10

--- Page 13 ---
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
All required financial statements were not presented or 7
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.
Governmental fund balances were not properly 6
classified.
Items reported as assets, deferred outflows of resources, 6
liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources were
not properly displayed.
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 5
presentation of net position was improper).
Finding 5
Financial statements and accompanying notes for five local governments did
not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or in
the accompanying notes, for five audit reports. Specifically, the local
governments did not include certain disclosures regarding long-term debt.
Adequate disclosure is necessary to facilitate the understanding of, and to provide
for fair presentation of, the financial information.
Noncompliance with State Law
Finding 6
Financial statements of 12 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required
by State law.
Financial statements of 12 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law (Exhibit A). The Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland requires that deposits with financial institutions by
local governmental units be fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes
the risk of loss of deposits in the event the financial institution defaults. In
addition, this law requires that collateral be of the types specified in the State
Finance and Procurement Article, Section 6-202 of the Code.

Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.
Finding 7
An unrestricted general fund deficit balance was noted for one local
government as of June 30, 2015.
An unrestricted general fund deficit balance was noted for one local government
as of June 30, 2015 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of
the current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem. This local government also had a general fund deficit
at June 30, 2014.
Finding 8
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local
governments as of June 30, 2015.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local governments as
of June 30, 2015 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local governments had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures. Significant unfavorable trends and ratios
were also noted for one of these local governments in the preceding year’s review.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Article,
Section 16-306 of the Code. Section 16-308 of this Article requires that certain
types of special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the
county in which the districts are located not later than 90 days after the close of
the fiscal year, in accordance with the rules and regulations established by the
applicable county. The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each
12

--- Page 15 ---
district’s compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting
copies of these reports to the Office of Legislative Audits.
Finding 9
The required reports had not been filed for four special taxing districts as of
July 29, 2016.
As of July 29, 2016, we had not received the required reports for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2015 for four special taxing districts which are located in Anne
Arundel County. Anne Arundel County advised us that they were in the process
of pursuing compliance with applicable filing requirements for these districts and
that appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding
funds).
