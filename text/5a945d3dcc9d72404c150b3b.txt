Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closing transactions that have not been previously recorded in the State’s
accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR).
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the CAFR. In its
audit report dated December 12, 2012, applicable to the fiscal year ended June 30,
2012, the firm stated that the State’s basic financial statements presented fairly, in
all material respects, the respective financial position of the State of Maryland as
of June 30, 2012, and the respective changes in the financial position and cash
flows, for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (referred to as GAAP).
The State’s CAFR states that, on a budgetary basis, the General Fund had an
unencumbered balance of approximately $551.2 million as of June 30, 2012. This
represents a decrease of approximately $438.9 million from the balance reported
at the preceding fiscal year-end ($990.1 million). The CAFR also states that the
State Reserve (Revenue Stabilization Account) balance totaled $674.4 million as
of June 30, 2012.
The budgetary General Fund balance does not reflect the effect of year-end
GAAP adjustments made to the State’s financial statements that were prepared on
a modified accrual basis of accounting. The net effect of the GAAP adjustments
recorded for fiscal year 2012, if they had been recognized on a budgetary basis,
would have been to reduce the aforementioned unencumbered budgetary General
Fund balance of $551.2 million. For example, year-end GAAP adjustments
included $77.4 million recorded for liabilities incurred by State agencies during
fiscal year 2012 for which general fund appropriations were not available to
finance the expenditures (see Exhibit 2). Other GAAP adjustments that would
have reduced the budgetary General Fund balance included an estimated $210
million additional liability for the State’s share of Medicaid costs for services
rendered during fiscal year 2012 and a $408 million reduction for State and local
income tax collections that were recorded as revenue for fiscal 2012 but were
applicable to future fiscal years.

Introduction, Objectives, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2012. This review was conducted under the authority of the
State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
The objective of our review was to determine whether budget closeout
transactions, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, were properly supported and
made in accordance with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting
policies.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end transactions for 30
Departments and independent agencies to ascertain if the transactions were
properly supported and made in accordance with State budgetary laws,
regulations, and accounting policies. We reviewed, on a limited basis,
transactions processed subsequent to June 30, 2012 to determine if the
transactions were properly recorded (such as charged or credited to the proper
fiscal year). We also reviewed the disposition of selected accrued expenditure and
encumbrance transactions from the fiscal year 2011 closing to ensure they were
appropriately paid and remaining balances, if any, were cancelled. As part of our
current review, we contacted various officials of State agencies, as well as the
independent accounting firm under contract with the State to express an opinion
on its financial statements. Our review excluded public colleges and universities
and transactions processed through the Transportation Trust Fund because the
related financial activity does not involve the State’s General Fund and/or because
agencies have the authority to retain unspent funds at year-end. Our conclusions
for the aforementioned objective are contained on page 9 of this report.
We also assessed the status of the findings identified during our review of the
budget closeout transactions for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, which were
reported to the Joint Audit Committee in a special report dated January 18, 2012.
Our follow-up review of the seven findings from the Statewide Review of Budget
Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2011 determined that two of the seven
findings had not been resolved and are repeated in this report.
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
7

reported. We advised the appropriate agencies of our findings. Formal responses
were not requested since this report contains no recommendations. Our fieldwork
was conducted during the period from August 2012 to January 2013.

Findings
Closeout Transactions
Conclusion
Our review of State agencies’ budget closeout transactions disclosed that such
transactions were generally properly supported and made in accordance with State
budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies. However, we determined
that seven departments or units thereof were not in compliance primarily because
certain year-end transactions were not properly recorded, could not be
substantiated, or did not comply with budget closeout requirements.
Revenue Transactions
Six State agencies recorded accrued federal fund revenues totaling $32.2 million
to cover expenditures even though related federal funds were not available (for
$23.9 million) or it was uncertain that the federal funds would be available (for
$8.3 million). Federal fund revenue can be accrued when agencies have incurred
expenditures for federal programs for which funding is still available, but have
not yet requested or received reimbursement. In addition, accrued special fund
revenues for one State agency had been recorded to cover special fund
expenditures totaling approximately $11.5 million, although collection was
questionable. Finally, one State agency maintained a special fund deficit balance
of $5.1 million as a result of an improper closing transaction recorded in a prior
year. The use of general funds will likely be required to eliminate the deficits
resulting from these transactions.
Expenditure Transactions
One State agency inappropriately recorded accrued general fund expenditures
totaling $446,445 at fiscal year-end to avoid reverting unused appropriations.
A summary of our findings, by agency, is included in Exhibit 1 on page 15 of this
report.
Prior Year Closing Encumbrances and Accrued Expenditures
Our review of the disposition of selected accrued expenditure and encumbrance
transactions totaling $319 million from the fiscal year 2011 closing disclosed that
the transactions were properly liquidated or adequate documentation existed
justifying why the transaction had not been liquidated.

Revenue Transactions
Finding 1
Accrued federal fund revenues totaling approximately $23.9 million were
recorded even though related federal funds were not available.
Analysis
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), the Department of
Human Resources (DHR), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA)
recorded federal fund revenues of approximately $12.9 million, $9.6 million, and
$1.4 million, respectively, even though federal funds were not available. These
revenues related to unreimbursed federal fund expenditures for several federal
programs. Since revenues are not available for these accruals, which were
recorded to cover federal fund expenditures that had been incurred, general fund
appropriations in subsequent years (or deficiency appropriations) will be needed
to eliminate the resulting deficit.
MSDE
MSDE recorded accrued revenue totaling approximately $12.9 million for which
MSDE failed to recover federal funds for expenditures incurred during fiscal
years 2002 and 2003 in relation to the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families
(TANF) grant. DHR, which processes the federal fund recoveries, advised us that
the TANF federal fund grants for those years have already been fully used and are
no longer available to reimburse the MSDE expenditures. A deficiency
appropriation has been requested to eliminate the outstanding $12.9 million
deficit. This issue has been commented upon in our six preceding annual budget
closeout reports.
DHR
DHR recorded accrued federal fund revenue totaling approximately $9.6 million
to cover a deficit related to disallowances by the United States Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS), which DHR was informed of in fiscal year
2009. The disallowances, related to certain Title IV-E grant expenditures from
the quarters ended September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008, were principally
based on a lack of a Title IV-E foster care pre-placement provision in DHR’s cost
allocation plan. DHR appealed the disallowances and, effective October 10,
2010, entered into a settlement agreement with DHHS to resolve all outstanding
appeals related to these disallowances. Under the agreement, DHR will not be
reimbursed by the federal government for the $9.6 million of disallowances,
which will therefore need to be paid with State general funds. A deficiency
appropriation has been requested to eliminate the outstanding $9.6 million deficit.
This issue has been commented upon in our three preceding annual budget
closeout reports.

DVA
DVA had unsubstantiated federal fund accrued revenues totaling $1.4 million,
which had been recorded on their behalf by the Comptroller of Maryland –
General Accounting Division (GAD). These revenues were recorded to eliminate
deficit balances that existed in several federal programs as of June 30, 2012.
Officials at DVA and GAD could not provide any documentation supporting that
federal funds would be received for these accrued revenues. According to GAD,
these deficits resulted from federal fund expenditures incurred during prior years.
This issue was commented upon in our preceding annual budgetary closeout
report.
GAD was aware of the unavailable federal fund receivables for MSDE and DHR
totaling $22.5 million, which were recorded as a decrease to general fund revenue
by GAD in the State’s fiscal year 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
Nevertheless, general funds are needed to offset the expenditures incurred.
Finding 2
The recovery of accrued federal revenues totaling approximately $8.3 million
is uncertain.
Analysis
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), the Department of
Aging (DOA), and the Military Department could not substantiate their ability
to recover accrued federal fund revenues of approximately $4.7 million, $2.9
million, and $700,000 respectively, as of June 30, 2012. If these agencies are
unable to recover these federal grant funds, general funds may be needed to
eliminate the resulting deficit.
MSDE
MSDE accrued revenue totaling $4.7 million related to Library Services
Technology Act (LSTA) grant expenditures made during fiscal years 2009 to
2012. MSDE has been unable to satisfy the documentation requirements for
reimbursement requests established by the federal grantor agency subsequent to
an audit conducted of MSDE’s fiscal year 2008 and 2009 LSTA grant
expenditures. The report issued by the audit firm engaged by the grantor agency
questioned costs previously reimbursed to MSDE totaling $783,866 due to lack of
adequate procedures and/or documentation to support amounts charged to the
grant for subgrantees, fringe benefit costs, other direct costs, and administrative
costs.
11

DOA
DOA recorded unsubstantiated federal fund accrued revenues of approximately
$2.9 million at June 30, 2012. These accrued revenues relate to unreimbursed
federal fund expenditures for the Money Follows the Person grant and Medicaid
Waiver that were incurred during fiscal year 2012 and prior years for which
requests for reimbursement had never been prepared.
Military
The Military Department recorded unsubstantiated federal fund accrued revenues
of $701,318 at June 30, 2012. These revenues relate to requests for federal
reimbursement for National Guard expenditures dating back to fiscal year 2010
that were denied for payment by the federal granting agency. This unsubstantiated
accrual revenue was recorded to eliminate a federal fund deficit balance at year-
end. We were advised by Department management that it believed that it will
ultimately be able to obtain federal funding to cover certain of these accruals.
Finding 3
Accrued special fund revenues related to assistance payments totaling
approximately $11.5 million could not be substantiated.
Analysis
The Department of Human Resources (DHR) recorded unsubstantiated special
fund accrued revenues of approximately $11.5 million at June 30, 2012 for Local
Department Operations Assistance Payments. DHR’s unsubstantiated special
fund accrued revenues were recorded to eliminate the deficit balance in the
assistance program special funds as of June 30, 2012. The deficit resulted from
special fund expenditures that exceeded the available special fund revenues
during fiscal years 2010 through 2012 (including $9,494,672 for 2012). A
deficiency appropriation has been requested to eliminate the outstanding deficit.
Finding 4
A general fund deficiency appropriation may be required to eliminate a
special fund deficit balance of $5.1 million.
Analysis
The Department of State Police (DSP) may require a general fund deficiency
appropriation to eliminate a special fund deficit balance totaling $5.1 million that
existed as of June 30, 2012. Specifically, DSP mistakenly recorded certain
transactions as both accrued revenue and actual revenue during fiscal year 2005.
This resulted in a special fund surplus of $5.6 million being reflected in the
records. DSP then transferred what appeared to be excess funds to the general
fund during the fiscal year 2005 closeout since it did not have legal authority to
12

--- Page 15 ---
retain any remaining balance in this special fund. When this mistake was
discovered during fiscal year 2006, DSP was left with a special fund deficit
balance of $5.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2006 due to the transfer of the
apparent surplus to the general fund and the subsequent automatic reversal of the
previously recorded accrued revenue transaction at the beginning of fiscal year
2006. Since fiscal year 2006, excess revenues of $500,000 were retained in the
fund, which reduced the negative balance to the current $5.1 million. A
deficiency appropriation has been requested to eliminate the outstanding $5.1
million deficit. This issue has been commented upon in our six preceding annual
budget closeout reports.
Expenditure Transactions
Finding 5
Excess general fund appropriations totaling $446,445 were not cancelled at
fiscal year-end.
Analysis
The Executive Department - Governor’s Office of Crime Control and
Prevention (GOCCP) did not cancel excess general fund appropriations totaling
$446,445 at fiscal year-end. Instead, GOCCP inappropriately recorded accrued
expenditures for the unused appropriation so that it could be retained and used in
future years. This practice violated the yearly closing instructions of the
Comptroller of Maryland - General Accounting Division (GAD) since the accrued
expenditures did not represent actual expenditures by the State for goods or
services and consequently would not qualify as valid accrued expenditures.
