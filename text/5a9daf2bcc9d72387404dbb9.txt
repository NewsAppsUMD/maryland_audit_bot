Key Findings – Internal Controls
Procurement – (p. 17)
(cid:131) CCPS had not evaluated the propriety of user
assigned capabilities to perform functions on the
automated procurement and payment system for
over 20 years. Due to the lack of system reports
of the capabilities assigned to users, there was no
assurance that appropriate controls were in place.
DPCS acknowledged that some employees were
provided with unnecessary or improper system
access.
Payroll – (p.23)
(cid:131) Because of the lack of system reports (similar to
the payment system), the propriety of the payroll
system capabilities assigned to employees could
not be determined.
(cid:131) Employees responsible for making adjustments
impacting payroll also approved such
adjustments. There was no process in place that
ensured an independent review of adjustments.

Key Findings – Other Issues
Transportation – (pgs. 37-40)
(cid:131) Although CCPS made significant payments to bus
contractors for employee benefits (such as health
care, leave and retirement), it had not evaluated
the costs and benefits of its current bus
contracting practices since 1995.
(cid:131) Payments to bus contractors were based on
criteria that may result in unnecessary payments
of $8 million over the useful life of the buses.
Food Services – (pg. 49)
(cid:131) CCPS used full-service kitchens in each of its 37
schools, which may contribute to higher food
service costs.
Health Care Costs – (pg.58)
(cid:131) CCPS did not verify the authenticity of health care
program participants and dependents, nor audit
health care claims paid.
