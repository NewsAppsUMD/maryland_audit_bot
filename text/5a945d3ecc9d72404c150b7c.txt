Mr. Karl S. Aro, Executive Director
Department of Legislative Services
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we have performed desk reviews of the audit reports filed by each county,
incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2007. The desk reviews consisted of assessments of compliance with
accounting and auditing standards, evaluations of compliance with certain State
laws, and analyses of selected financial data to identify potential financial
problems.
Most of the local governments and their independent auditors substantially
complied with accounting and auditing standards for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2007. Nevertheless, we identified instances of noncompliance with certain
requirements of our audit guidelines, generally accepted accounting principles,
and/or generally accepted auditing standards. Letters were sent to 62 local
governments and to their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies
disclosed by our reviews so that corrective actions could be taken to help ensure
future compliance.

--- Page 4 ---
The financial statements disclosed 26 local governments with uninsured/
uncollateralized bank deposits, which is an area of noncompliance with State law.
In addition, our desk reviews identified 6 local governments with potential
financial problems (such as deficit fund balances or unfavorable financial trends).
Where appropriate, letters were sent to these local governments, and to their
legislative representatives, to communicate their noncompliance or potential
financial problems, and to request that the local governments advise us of the
corrective actions that will be taken.
Respectfully submitted,
Bruce A. Myers, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Introduction and Scope
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires each
county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland to file annual
(once every four years under specified conditions) audit reports. There were 190
local government audit reports due for fiscal year 2007 (24 counties, 148 cities
and towns, and 18 taxing districts). The reports are to include financial
statements with accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions
as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented. The financial
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. We have prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide
additional information regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing
requirements.
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code requires the Office of Legislative Audits to
perform a desk review of each local government’s annual audit report for
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards.
Subsections (b) through (f) of Section 40 specify the reporting and review
requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by the counties. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is required to
review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2007 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as of three fiscal year 2006 reports (Towns of East New Market and Forest
Heights and the City of Glenarden) received subsequent to our previous review.
The desk reviews were performed to accomplish the following tasks:
• Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and accounting and
auditing standards, using a checklist for governmental audits published by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
• Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits).

• Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances, underfunded pension plans, or unfavorable trends and ratios,
based on analyses of financial data over the most recent five-year period (July
1, 2002 through June 30, 2007).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2007 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
One local government had not filed audit reports for fiscal years 2006 and
2007, and one other local government had not filed an audit report for fiscal
year 2007 only. Thirty-three local governments submitted audit reports after
the required filing date.
One local government had not filed audit reports for fiscal years 2006 and 2007,
and one other local government had not filed an audit report for fiscal year 2007
only. Furthermore, 33 local governments submitted audit reports after the
required filing date. The failure of a local government to file an audit, or a delay
in filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The
submission of audit reports after the required filing date was also noted for 13 of
these 33 local governments during our preceding year’s review. Article 19,
Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires audit reports to be filed
by November 1 after the close of the fiscal year, or by January 1 after the close of
the fiscal year for those local governments with a population of more than
400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2007 had not
been received, as of August 28, 2008, for the Mount Savage Special Taxing Area
local government entity. The failure of this taxing district to submit audit reports
has been reported to the Executive Director of the Department of Legislative
Services. If these reports are not filed, the State Comptroller, acting upon the
advice of the Executive Director, is authorized by law to discontinue the payment
of all funds, grants, or State aid to which the taxing district is entitled.
Additionally, an audit report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 had not been
received for the Town of Forest Heights as of August 28, 2008.
We will review these fiscal year 2006 and 2007 audit reports and take any follow-
up action necessary when they are received. The results of these reviews will be
included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2008 local government audit
reports.
The Town of Barclay and the Village of Port Tobacco requested and were granted
waivers from filing audit reports in fiscal year 2007 because they met the
conditions for filing an audit report every fourth year as provided for under
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code. These entities will next be required to file
an audit report for fiscal year 2010. The Towns of Brookview, Church Creek,
Eldorado, Galestown, Henderson, Hillsboro, Marydel, Queen Anne, and
Templeville had previously requested and were granted waivers from filing audit
6

reports. These towns will next be required to file an audit report for either fiscal
year 2008 or fiscal year 2009.
The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion.
The audit report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion related
to the discretely presented component unit for fiscal year 2007 due to the
omission of financial data for the Town’s legally separate component unit.
Specifically, the Warfield Development Corporation was determined to be a
component unit of the Town based on criteria established by generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, financial data for the Corporation should be
reported as part of the Town’s financial reporting entity. However, the
Corporation’s financial statements were not included in the Town’s financial
statements because audited financial statements were not available for the
Corporation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The Town’s audit report for
fiscal year 2006 also contained an adverse opinion due to this situation.
An adverse opinion states that the financial statements for an opinion unit (or for
the financial statements taken as a whole) do not present fairly the financial
position, changes in financial position or, where applicable, cash flows in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Auditors’ reports for 16 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for 16 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The auditors’ reports for
8 of these local governmental units included a deficiency that was also cited
during our previous year’s review. The following is a summary of these
deficiencies:
Number of Audit
Area of Noncompliance
Reports
Auditor did not express an opinion(s) on all opinion units 10
or on all financial statements or information.
Auditor’s report did not include all basic elements of an 5
audit report (for example, report was not presented in
accordance with the State and Local Governments
Audit Guide published by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants).
Auditor’s report did not report on all prior-period financial 1
information presented.

Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires that audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. These
standards require, in part, that the auditor express an opinion(s) as to whether the
basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position, the respective changes in financial position, and cash flows,
where applicable, of the local government in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Financial statements submitted by 24 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 24 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of 2 of these local governments included two or more such
deficiencies, and the financial statements of 8 of these local governments included
one or more deficiencies that were also cited during our preceding year’s review.
The following is a summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of
instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 15
presentation of Statement of Cash Flows was
improper).
All required financial statements were not presented or 12
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.
Financial statements and accompanying notes for 11 local governments did
not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or in
the accompanying notes, for 11 audit reports. The financial statements of 3 of
these local governments included two or more areas of insufficient disclosure, and
the financial statements for 8 of these local governments included an area of
insufficient disclosure that was also cited during our preceding year’s review.
Adequate disclosure is necessary to facilitate the understanding of, and to provide
for fair presentation of the financial information. The following is a summary of
these areas of insufficient disclosure and the corresponding number of instances:

Noncompliance with State Law
Financial statements of 26 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law.
Financial statements of 26 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by State
law (Exhibit A). Article 95, Section 22 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires that deposits with financial institutions by local governmental units be
fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes the risk of loss of deposits in
the event the financial institution defaults.
Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for three local
governments as of June 30, 2007.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for three local governments
as of June 30, 2007 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of
the current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem. All three of these local governments also had a
general fund deficit as of June 30, 2006.

Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local
governments as of June 30, 2007.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local governments as
of June 30, 2007 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local governments had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures.
The pension plan for one local government was significantly underfunded.
One local government had a pension plan that was significantly underfunded.
Specifically, members of the Fire and Police Departments of Baltimore City, who
were hired prior to January 1, 1947, were eligible for coverage under a defined
benefit retirement plan. All employees eligible under the plan have retired.
The City funds pension benefits under this plan on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.
During fiscal year 2007, the City contributed approximately $2.2 million to the
plan. The present value of future benefits related to this plan was approximately
$9.3 million as of June 30, 2007.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Code. Subsections (b) through (f) of this Section require that certain types of
special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the county in
which they are located within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year in accordance
with the rules and regulations established by the applicable county. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each district’s compliance with the
applicable provisions of the law and for submitting copies of these reports to the
Office of Legislative Audits.
The required reports have not been filed for three special taxing districts.
As of August 28, 2008, we had not received the required reports for three special
taxing districts located in Anne Arundel County for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007. The County advised us that they were in the process of pursuing
compliance with applicable filing requirements for these districts and that
appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding County
funds).
