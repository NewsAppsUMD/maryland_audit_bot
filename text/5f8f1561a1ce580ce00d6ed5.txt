Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020
1) Department of Information Technology (DoIT) (5/1/20 – 29 pages – 10 findings, including
2 repeats)
 OLA’s audit disclosed certain deficiencies with DoIT’s processes for overseeing the State’s
major information technology development projects (MITDPs). DoIT lacked sufficient
documentation that it effectively monitored MITDPs through its review of annual status
reports and other monthly monitoring activities. For example, our test of fiscal year 2019
annual status reports for four projects estimated to cost $645.7 million disclosed that DoIT
did not document its review and approval of any of these reports, and critical information
had not been updated in the annual status reports from the preceding year for three of the
projects estimated to cost $471.1 million.
 DoIT had not established a process to independently evaluate the performance of oversight
project managers supplied by its third-party vendor to oversee MITDPs. For one of these
projects, the Shared Human Services Platform (MD THINK), we noted certain issues
regarding project costs and timeliness.
 DoIT contracted with a vendor to design and implement the Maryland First Responders
Interoperable Radio System Team (Maryland FiRST), but did not ensure that the vendor
met certain contractual requirements prior to paying vendor invoices.
 Certain security control deficiencies relating to the networks and computer resources under
DoIT’s responsibility were identified. For example, intrusion detection and prevention
system coverage did not exist for a substantial amount of untrusted network traffic flowing
into the DoIT internal network. In addition, DoIT, in conjunction with the Comptroller of
Maryland and the Department of Budget and Management, did not ensure that personally
identifiable information (PII) for State vendors stored in the State’s Financial Management
Information System (FMIS) was adequately restricted. The PII was accessible to thousands
of State employees.
 Deficiencies in a number of other areas of DoIT responsibilities were identified. For
example, DoIT did not sufficiently control equipment and the monitoring of its contractor for
the State’s high-speed data network. DoIT also lacked formal written agreements with the
29 State agencies to clarify responsibilities for services it provides to them through the
Enterprise Technology Support Services Initiative.

Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020
2) Maryland Public Broadcasting Commission (MPBC) (6/25/20 – 16 pages – 4 findings,
including 1 repeat)
 MPBC did not establish formal policies and procedures to address revenue generating
activities of its affiliated foundation. MPBC also did not effectively monitor the affiliated
foundation and could not document that it received and reviewed conflict of interest
disclosures for foundation board members and officers. The audit report included a number
of recommendations regarding the comprehensiveness of the agreement between MPBC’s
affiliated foundation and MPBC, and regarding the adequacy of the procedures to ensure
and document that potential or actual conflicts of interest existing for foundation board
members and officers were identified and properly resolved. MPBC initially disagreed with
the analysis and recommendations of this finding based primarily on the premise that the
foundation is an independent legal entity. Notwithstanding the aforementioned
disagreement, MPBC subsequently indicated that it would (1) review the policies of the
foundation to determine if any new ones need to be created, (2) continually monitor the
foundation’s revenue generating activities, and (3) document the receipt and review of the
annual conflict of interest disclosures by foundation board members and officers.
Considering the significant revenue provided to MPBC by the foundation from corporate
underwriters and sponsors, MPBC needs to ensure comprehensive and appropriate
documented oversight of the foundation’s activities is in place. Our report highlighted areas
where MPBC’s policies and procedures could be enhanced for that purpose.
 MPBC’s procurement policies and procedures were not sufficiently comprehensive and
certain critical provisions were not approved by MPBC’s governing Commission. In
addition, MPBC did not obtain approval for certain exempt procurements and did not publish
certain non-exempt contract awards on eMaryland Marketplace, as required.
 MPBC did not obtain and review the required independent control review of its fundraising
services vendor and, as a result, certain security concerns over fundraising data were not
identified by MPBC and addressed with the vendor timely.
 MPBC had either not performed or did not adequately perform monthly reconciliations of its
donor collections to its donor database for the period from August 2018 to August 2019.

Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020
3) Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City (BLLC) (Performance)
(5/11/20 – 35 pages – 8 findings, including 1 repeat)
This audit report contained a number of recommendations related to the eight report findings.
Although BLLC agreed to implement the majority of the recommendations, BLLC continues to
disagree with two recommendations. Since we believe all report recommendations are
appropriate and necessary, we attempted to obtain BLLC concurrence on these two issues
through the OLA’s routine audit follow-up process. Unfortunately, OLA was unable to persuade
BLLC to implement the recommended necessary controls.
State Government Article, Section 2-1224(g)(1)(v) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires
the OLA to advise the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee (JAEC) when the response by the
agency is not considered appropriate to carry out an audit recommendation. For that reason,
OLA recommends, as a first step, that the JAEC issue a letter of concern to the BLLC
requesting implementation of the recommended corrective action for the following items.
 BLLC’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) did not include certain critical aspects of the
inspection process, including if and when follow-up inspections should be conducted after
issues or violations are noted. The audit report recommended that BLLC enhance its SOPs
to address the critical aspects of the inspection process enumerated in the report finding. In
a recent follow-up letter response, BLLC indicated it had made policy enhancements
regarding follow-up inspections and included references to specific sections of the SOPs.
However, the referenced sections did not relate to follow-up inspections related to
violations. We continue to believe that the standard operating procedures should specify
when follow-up inspections are performed on licensees with violations.
 BLLC inspectors did not always follow up on inspections violations and did not always
document conclusions when conducting inspections. The audit report recommended that
BLLC conduct follow-up inspections or take other appropriate actions to ensure violations
noted during inspections are resolved. In a recent follow-up letter response BLLC stated
that it continues to disagree with this recommendation because it lacks the capacity to
conduct these follow-up investigations independently. BLLC’s response also stated that the
Baltimore Police Department (BPD) determines when and where these follow-up
inspections can be conducted. Based on the nature of the violations, we continue to believe
it is both reasonable and appropriate to conduct follow-up inspections to determine if noted
violations or issues have been resolved. However, we acknowledged that there may be
reasons why a follow-up inspection is not practical or cannot be performed, and in those
instances, we countered that BLLC document the reason(s) why follow-up inspections
cannot be performed, such as the unavailability of BPD resources. BLLC disagreed with
OLA suggested accommodation.
