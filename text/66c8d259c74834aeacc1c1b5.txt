Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a review of data provided to us by the Comptroller of Maryland – Office of
the Comptroller and the Comptroller’s Revenue Administration Division (RAD) relating to tax
year 2021 individual income tax returns that included a claim for a Pass Through Entity (PTE)
tax credit.1 Our review was conducted as a follow-up to our most recent audit report on RAD
dated January 22, 2024 which included an informational comment addressing an allegation
received through our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline regarding extensive delays in refunds
claimed on personal income tax returns that included a PTE credit.
We conducted the review under the authority of State Government Article, Section 2-1220 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland. This review was not an audit, and we made no recommendations
related to our review. Our RAD audit report noted a September 19, 2023 letter from the Office
of the Comptroller to tax professionals acknowledging challenges in processing returns claiming
the PTE credit. The letter attributed the delays to the complexity of returns filed, lack of staff,
and outdated technology and outlined the steps being taken and the progress being made to
address these challenges and delays, as well as steps that tax professionals can take to help
expedite return processing.
During our audit, RAD advised us that as of October 2023, the majority of the outstanding
credits for tax year 2021 had been resolved. We requested detailed documentation from RAD to
support the number of returns with PTE credits received and the number that were still not
processed. RAD was unable to provide the requested information prior to the issuance of our
1 State law provides that a member of a PTE, such as a partner in a partnership, may claim a credit on their personal
income tax return for taxes paid by the PTE attributable to the member’s share of the PTE’s taxable income.

report. As a result, we were unable to determine the disposition of the PTE credits to determine
the veracity and disposition of the allegation.
In April 2024, RAD provided us with a report which indicated that, as of April 4, 2024, a total of
76,684 individual income tax returns claiming PTE credits totaling $1.9 billion had been
received for tax year 2021. According to the report, of

and the taxpayer’s timeliness in submitting any Total 76,110
required follow-up information and supporting Source: RAD provided report of all Tax Year
2021 returns that included PTE credits
documentation requested by RAD.
During our current review, we inquired as to whether RAD had addressed the staffing and
technology issues noted in the Comptroller’s letter, which contributed to the delayed processing
of the PTE credits. RAD advised us that it enhanced its automated system to more efficiently
process the PTE credits and reduce the staff resources needed.
We did not test the functionality of the enhancements claimed by RAD, but did request and
receive data on tax year 2022 individual income tax returns claiming a PTE credit. We
performed various tests of the data and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable.
According to the data, as of May 8, 2024, RAD had received, 80,989 returns that claimed PTE
credits totaling $1.6 billion, of which 80,293 had been fully processed, and 696 with PTE credits
totaling $1.1 million were still pending. The aforementioned 80,293 returns were processed
within 440 days according to the report, with approximately 93 percent processed within 180
days or 6 months.
