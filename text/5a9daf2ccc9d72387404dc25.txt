Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012
1) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) – Department of Human Resources
(DHR) – Medical Assistance Program – Using the Federal Death Master File to Detect
and Prevent Medicaid Payments Attributable to Deceased Individuals (Performance)
(12/02/11 – 15 pages – 3 findings)
We conducted a performance audit to evaluate whether the Social Security Administration’s
Death Master File (DMF) was an efficient and effective tool for detecting and preventing
Medicaid payments made to service providers for deceased persons. We also reviewed the
case files for certain matched cases to identify factors that suggest system or process
changes that may be needed to prevent or detect improper payments.
• Performing periodic computerized matches of the Medicaid eligibility file to the DMF
appears to be a practical and cost-effective tool to help detect and prevent certain
improper Medicaid payments. Although DHMH performs certain matches of Medicaid
files against the Maryland Vital Statistics Administration death database, such matches
only include individuals who die in Maryland. The DMF contains nationwide death data.
• We matched the DMF to the DHMH file of Medicaid-eligible persons and subsequently
determined if any payments were made attributable to matched persons after their
reported dates of death. These procedures disclosed payments totaling $2.5 million
attributable to 323 individuals after their reported date of death.
• We judgmentally selected 20 of the matched individuals with such payments for further
testing and determined that improper payments totaling $426,000 were made after the
actual dates of death of 10 of these individuals. At the time of our review, DHMH had
recovered $115,000 of these overpayments.
• Our match based on social security number only disclosed 1,582 individuals reflected
as eligible for Medicaid services that were listed as deceased on the DMF. Medicaid
payments totaling $7.5 million were attributable to 532 of these individuals from January
1, 2008 to March 10, 2011 for services rendered after their dates of death reported on
the DMF. Even if these individuals are not deceased, the results suggest there could be
other data inaccuracies involving social security numbers, birth dates, and names within
DHR and DHMH computer systems.
• We noted other factors that contributed to the failure to detect the payments made for
the aforementioned 10 cases, such as inconsistencies between DHMH and DHR
systems’ records and between agency files and system records. DHMH and DHR
should institute system or procedural changes to resolve discrepancies timely.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012
2) Department of Transportation – Maryland Transit Administration (2/17/12 – 28 pages –
11 findings)
• MTA’s monitoring of a vendor contracted to administer and pay healthcare claims on
behalf of its union employees and retirees was insufficient. For example, MTA paid for
claim reimbursements invoiced by the vendor without any verification that the amounts
invoiced were proper and did not conduct claims reviews to ensure that the vendor only
paid claims for services provided to eligible individuals. MTA also did not verify that
administrative fees invoiced and paid for each individual were consistent with the
coverage selected. During FY 2009 through FY 2011, MTA paid the vendor $112.7
million ($104.4 million in claims reimbursements and $8.3 million in administrative fees).
• MTA lacked adequate procedures and controls to ensure that amounts paid under a
$10 million consulting services contract were proper. MTA could not document that it
approved increases in direct labor rates paid to the contractor, nor did MTA compare
the direct labor rates on the invoices with the related contract. MTA also paid overhead
rates based on estimated rates because actual audited overhead rates were not
provided, as required.
• MTA lacked sufficient procedures and controls over the eligibility process for the
federally mandated Mobility Paratransit Program (MPP) for individuals who are unable
to use fixed route services. For example, eligibility determinations were not subject to
independent review and approval and there was no formal guidance to assist MTA staff
in determining applicant eligibility. In addition, MTA did not adequately monitor
payments made under one MPP contract selected for review. The vendor had a three-
year contract totaling $57 million.
• MTA did not attempt to obtain refunds of excise taxes paid to the MPP vendors for fuel
used in State vehicles. OLA determined that MTA paid the three MPP vendors
approximately $744,000 for federal and State excise taxes during fiscal year 2011.
• The Reduced Fare Program (RFP) application process for disabled individuals who use
the fixed route system was not sufficiently controlled and lacked formal guidance to
assist MTA staff in determining applicant eligibility. For example, one individual had
unilateral control over the RFP application process without any independent review and
approval. According to MTA records, the value of RFP discounts provided totaled $10.8
million during calendar year 2010.
• Internal control and procedural deficiencies were noted with respect to disbursements,
payroll, bus inspections, materials and supplies, and equipment.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012
3) Department of Human Resources (DHR) – Local Department Operations (5/16/12 – 19
pages – 6 findings)
In accordance with State law, DHR’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) performed the
required audits of the 24 local departments of social services (LDSS) during our audit period.
To avoid duplication of work, we relied on the audit work performed by the OIG. The findings
in this report are primarily based on the OIG’s audit reports.
• The OIG audits of the LDSSs contained a significant number of reportable conditions,
including many repeat findings. The audits resulted in 373 findings, with 77, or 21%, of
them being repeat findings. Although the OIG has an established corrective action
monitoring process, the number of repeat findings indicates that more active oversight
by DHR management is needed.
• The LDSSs had a significant number of deficiencies over critical activities subject to
Social Services Administration (SSA) oversight. Specifically 101 findings for 23 LDSSs
related to SSA activities – primarily foster care. Foster care case files could not always
be located or did not include all required documentation and the eligibility of certain
children in foster care for federal aid was not determined timely.
• The OIG reported numerous deficiencies by the LDSSs related to critical areas subject
to the policies of the Family Investment Administration (FIA), such as ensuring eligibility
for public assistance and food benefits. OIG audit reports contained 79 findings for 20
LDSSs related to FIA policies for public assistance programs.
• Controls and procedures were inadequate over certain LDSS budget and financial
activities. OIG audit reports resulted in 114 findings in budget and finance-related areas
such as bank accounts, corporate purchasing cards, prepaid gift cards, small
procurement, and cash receipts.
• Users’ access to certain key computer systems was not properly restricted or
monitored. OIG audit reports identified 36 findings for 17 LDSSs related to computer
security.
• OIG audit reports identified 43 findings in other areas. These areas include certain
administrative operations and child care subsidy activities overseen by the Maryland
State Department of Education.
