AUDIT FINDING AND RECOMMENDATION
Improve Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission (Commission) does not have an adequate business impact
analysis, risk assessment, continuity of operations plan or disaster recovery plan for its sensitive and mission
critical applications. In our review of the documentation, we identified the following concerns:
• The Commission has not documented basic steps for their disaster recovery plan.
• The Commission has not documented the role and expectations of their
computer/software support company with the company, to establish steps in the event of
some disaster.
Inadequate documentation of the Commission's continuity of operations and disaster recovery plans
places the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Commission's sensitive and mission critical
information at risk. Industry best practices require that agencies develop business impact analysis, risk
assessments, continuity of operations plans, and disaster recovery plans for sensitive and mission critical
applications. Additionally, agencies must perform annual tests of these plans.
The Federal Information Systems Controls Audit Manual section 3.6 – Service Continuity states:
“Losing the capability to process, retrieve, and protect information maintained electronically can significantly
affect an agency’s ability to accomplish its mission. For this reason, an agency should have (1) procedures in
place to protect information resources and minimize the risk of unplanned interruptions and (2) a plan to
recover critical operations should interruptions occur. These plans should consider the activities performed at
general support facilities, such as data processing centers and telecommunications facilities, as well as the
activities performed by users of specific applications. To determine whether recovery plans will work as
intended, they should be tested periodically in disaster simulation exercises.”
The Commission should apply the industry best practices consistently to all applications housing
sensitive and mission critical information. The Commission should start this process by dedicating the
necessary resources to review and remediate the risks to their sensitive and mission critical applications.

AGENCY BACKGROUND AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership
consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
The Commission has the following responsibilities:
1. Reseeding and replanting oyster bars;
2. Prescribing the type, size, and description of seafood available for fishing;
3. Issuing licenses for the taking of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams and for boats, vessels, and
related equipment; and
4. Imposing an inspection tax on oysters caught in the Potomac River.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the following
sources.
2007 2006
Virginia appropriations $175,000 $155,000
Maryland appropriations 175,000 155,000
Federal grant 104,772 82,365
Special grant 22,500 5,000
Sport fishing licenses 93,148 90,643
Commercial fishing licenses 61,010 62,425
Commercial crab licenses 57,985 61,685
Commercial oyster licenses 13,845 13,780
Oyster bushel tax 4,795 4,073
Interest and miscellaneous 13,248 13,152
Total revenue $721,303 $643,123
The Commission experienced a revenue increase for fiscal year 2007, as a result of a significant
increase in the Virginia and Maryland appropriations, as well as federal and special grants contributed to this
increase. As of July 2006, the Commission obtained a multi-year federal grant to support management and
analysis of fishery data; fishery research including biological and socioeconomic research; and fishery
management planning. The multi-year grant made federal funds more readily available, allowing the
Commission to use federal grant funds to the fullest extent possible, increasing grant funds during fiscal year
2007.
The Commission increased its funding of a special grant to support a contract for technical services of
the "Eco-risk Assessment of Asian Oyster Introduction to Chesapeake Bay" project. The funding helped
cover the Ecological Risk Assessment and Analysis portion of the Environmental Impact Study for this
project.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years.
2007 2006
Personnel services $ 350,887 $ 298,489
Federal grant 99,265 78,151
Contractual services 70,140 82,476
Development and repletion 55,568 49,728
Materials and supplies 46,432 41,337
Insurance 5,481 8,122
Fixed assets 2,819 3,086
Total expenses $ 630,592 $ 561,389
Expenses increased by $69,203 from fiscal year 2006. During fiscal year 2007, personnel expenses
increased because the Commission hired an additional staff member, an assistant executive secretary, at the
end of fiscal year 2006. The assistant executive secretary provided continuity of services and operations as
the current executive secretary neared retirement. Federal grant expenses increased because the Commission
received a multi-year federal grant, making funds readily available resulting in the Commission spending
more federal funds faster.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2006 with an overall operating gain of $81,734. The Commission
closed fiscal year 2007 with an overall operating gain of $90,711, which is consistent with operations in
previous years.
Prior to and during construction of the new office building, the Commission set aside funds in a
capital account to pay for the building construction. Upon completion of the building, total cost for the
building was $811,500. The Commission did not have adequate funds in the capital account to pay all
construction expenses. As a result, the Commission obtained a bank loan for $165,000 to cover the remaining
construction costs. The 5.75 percent interest note has minimum monthly payments of $1,811 with a final
balloon payment due on January 3, 2009. The Commission made $3,000 monthly payments during fiscal
year 2006 towards the loan balance and an additional $50,000 principal-only payment June 2006 with the
approval of the Board of Commissioners. This lump sum payment brought the June 30, 2006 loan balance
down to $72,445. Beginning in fiscal year 2007, the Commission made $4,000 monthly payments toward the
loan balance and a $31,336 payment in June 2007 to pay the note in full.
The Commission continues to place any excess cash into both the Maryland and Virginia Local
Government Investment Pools. These accounts represent just over $117,672 in investment funds.

We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac Rivers Fisheries Commission
for the year ended June 30, 2007. We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our
audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions in the
Commission’s accounting records, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls, and test for
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal control
and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and
efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
We gained an understanding of the relevant internal controls, both automated and manual, sufficient
to plan the audit. We considered materiality and control risk in determining the nature and extent of our audit
procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of transactions,
and account balances.
Cash and investments Federal grant revenues and expenses
License revenues Payroll
Operating and capital expenses Information Security
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had been
placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with provisions of
4

applicable laws and regulations. Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection
of documents and records, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We tested transactions and
performed analytical procedures, including budgetary and trend analysis. We confirmed bank balances with
outside parties.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded and
reported in the Commission’s accounting records. The Commission records its financial transactions on the
cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information presented in this report came
directly from the Commission’s accounting records.
We noted a certain matter involving internal control and its operation that requires management’s
attention and corrective action. This matter is described in the section entitled “Audit Finding and
Recommendation.” The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations disclosed no
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing
Standards.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on July 1, 2008. Management agreed to implement the
recommendation but chose not to include a response in this report.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the state of Maryland and is a public record.
