Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland Department of
Labor (MDL) – Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) for the period beginning
January 3, 2020 and ending January 15, 2024. OFR is the primary regulator for
financial institutions chartered in Maryland, including banks, credit unions, and
State-licensed financial entities, including mortgage lenders. OFR is responsible
for licensing and supervising these businesses to ensure compliance with laws and
regulations of Maryland.
Our audit disclosed that annual business license renewals were not being
reviewed by OFR supervisory personnel during our audit period to ensure only
qualified applicants had their licenses renewed.
Our audit also included a review to determine the status of the finding contained
in our preceding audit report. We determined that OFR did not satisfactorily
address this finding, which is repeated in this report.
MDL’s response to this audit, on behalf of OFR, is included as an appendix to this
report. We reviewed the response to our findings and related recommendations,
and have concluded that the corrective actions identified are sufficient to address
all audit issues. In accordance with our policy, we have redacted any vendor
names or products mentioned by MDL in this document.

--- Page 4 ---
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the audit by OFR.
We also wish to acknowledge MDL’s and OFR’s willingness to address the audit
issues and implement appropriate corrective actions.
Respectfully submitted,
Brian S. Tanen

Background Information
Name Change and Agency Responsibilities
Chapter 28, Laws of Maryland 2023 effective July 1, 2023, changed the name of
the Maryland Department of Labor (MDL) – Office of the Commissioner of
Financial Regulation to Office of Financial Regulation (OFR). OFR is
responsible for chartering and supervising Maryland state-chartered banks, credit
unions, and trust companies; licensing and supervising state-licensed financial
institutions including mortgage lenders, mortgage brokers, mortgage servicers,
mortgage loan originators, affiliated insurance producer-originators, check
cashers, money transmitters, consumer debt collection agencies, consumer
lenders, installment lenders, sales finance businesses, credit services businesses,
debt management companies; and registering and supervising credit reporting
agencies and debt settlement companies, to ensure compliance with the laws and
regulations of Maryland.
OFR issues licenses for non-depository institutions after investigation of each
applicant and approves charters for banking institutions and credit unions to form
new institutions, open branches, make stock acquisitions, form affiliates, and
merge with other financial institutions. OFR also serves as a resource to
consumers and to the entities and individuals that it supervises and regulates by,
for example, investigating consumer complaints, providing guidance to regulated
entities and individuals as to their responsibilities under the law, and connecting
citizens to effective financial education. According to the State’s records, during
fiscal year 2023, OFR’s expenditures totaled approximately $12.1 million (see
Figure 1 on the following page).

Status of Finding From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the finding contained in our
preceding audit report dated April 16, 2020. We determined that OFR did not
satisfactorily address that finding, which is repeated in this report.
1 Prior to December 1, 2021, a hiring freeze resulted in certain positions being frozen. Frozen
positions were unauthorized to be filled according to budgetary instructions from the Department
of Budget and Management. Any position that is currently marked as frozen has not been filled
since the freeze was lifted; however, these positions now are available to be filled.

Findings and Recommendations
License Renewals
Finding 1
The Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) did not have procedures for
supervisory reviews of business license renewals to ensure that only qualified
applicants had their licenses renewed.
Analysis
OFR did not have procedures for review and approval of annual business license
renewals by supervisory personnel to ensure that only qualified applicants had
their licenses renewed. According to OFR’s records, 20,224 business licenses
were issued in fiscal year 2023 to various institutions and entities, such as
mortgage lenders, collections agencies, check cashing outlets, and credit service
businesses; of which 16,148 were license renewals that could be unilaterally
processed by any of 10 OFR employees.
Applicants for a license renewal must submit evidence of required continuing
education, a statement of business volume and proof of the required surety bond if
the entity does not already have the maximum bond required, as well as the
required license fee. Our arbitrary test of 20 licenses that were renewed in
calendar year 2023 without independent review and approval disclosed 2 that
lacked the required documentation of continuing education or surety bond. As a
result, there was a lack of assurance that these applicants had the necessary
qualifications for the license.
A similar condition regarding the issuance of initial and renewal license
applications was commented upon in our preceding audit report. Although OFR
established certain procedures to review initial license applications on a test basis,
no procedures were established for review of renewal licenses.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that OFR
a. establish procedures to require supervisory review and approval of
business license renewals, at least on a test basis, to help ensure that all
required documentation is provided and that license renewals are only
issued to qualified applicants (repeat); and
b. obtain the required support for the aforementioned applications that did
not have the required documentation and take any necessary corrective
action.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland Department of
Labor (MDL) – Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) for the period beginning
January 3, 2020 and ending January 15, 2024. The audit was conducted in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine OFR’s financial
transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance with
applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included consumer credit and oversight of financial
institutions, including examinations and licensing. We also determined the status
of the finding contained in our preceding audit report.
Our audit did not include certain support services provided to OFR by MDL –
Office of the Secretary. These support services (such as payroll, purchasing,
maintenance of accounting records, and related fiscal functions) are included
within the scope of our audits of MDL – Office of the Secretary.
Our assessment of internal controls was based on agency procedures and controls
in place at the time of our fieldwork. Our tests of transactions and other auditing
procedures were generally focused on the transactions occurring during our audit
period of January 3, 2020 to January 15, 2024, but may include transactions
before or after this period as we considered necessary to achieve our audit
objectives.
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, tests of transactions,
and to the extent practicable, observations of OFR’s operations. Generally,
transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgment, which primarily
considers risk, the timing or dollar amount of the transaction or the significance of
the transaction to the area of operation reviewed. As a matter of course, we do
not normally use sampling in our tests, so unless otherwise specifically indicated,
6

--- Page 9 ---
neither statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was used to select the
transactions tested. Therefore, unless sampling is specifically indicated in a
finding, the results from any tests conducted or disclosed by us cannot be used to
project those results to the entire population from which the test items were
selected.
We also performed various data extracts of pertinent information from the State’s
Financial Management Information System (such as revenue data). The extracts
are performed as part of ongoing internal processes established by the Office of
Legislative Audits and were subject to various tests to determine data reliability.
We determined that the data extracted from this source was sufficiently reliable
for the purposes the data were used during this audit. Finally, we performed other
auditing procedures that we considered necessary to achieve our audit objectives.
The reliability of data used in this report for background or informational
purposes was not assessed.
OFR’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records;
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including safeguarding of assets; and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved. As
provided in Government Auditing Standards, there are five components of
internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities,
information and communication, and monitoring. Each of the five components,
when significant to the audit objectives, and as applicable to OFR, were
considered by us during the course of this audit.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes a finding relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect OFR’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. This finding is also considered a significant instance of
7

--- Page 10 ---
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Other less significant
findings were communicated to OFR that did not warrant inclusion in this report.
MDL’s response, on behalf of OFR, to our finding and recommendations, is
included as an appendix to this report. As prescribed in State Government
Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we will advise MDL
regarding the results of our review of its response.

Agency Response
Analysis
Please provide OFR understands the importance of maintaining the integrity of its
additional comments as licensing processes and believes its automated and manual procedures
deemed necessary. limit the risk of unqualified applicants receiving licenses. It developed
and implemented a set of quality control policies and procedures to test
the approval process for new business license applicants to ensure
statutory compliance in response to the 2020 audit. Those changes did
not extend to renewal applications. OFR will correct the omission and
develop and implement appropriate policies and procedures to review
renewal applications.
Recommendation 1a Agree Estimated Completion Date: 10/31/2024

of testing and troubleshooting new policies prior to final
implementation. This draft includes procedures for the supervisory
review of sample batches of renewal business license applications to
ensure statutory compliance. The Licensing Unit also began adding
internal notes to its licensing system during the pre-renewal process to
provide more information for supervisors during the renewal review
