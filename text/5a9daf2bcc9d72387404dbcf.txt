Audit Overview
 DDA plans, develops policies and regulations, and
funds a statewide system of services for individuals
with developmental disabilities and their families.
 Through private contractors, DDA funds services to
the developmentally disabled, various community-
based programs that include community residential
services, day habilitation services, and vocational
training.
 The report included 14 findings, 4 of which were
repeated from the preceding audit report. These
four repeated findings appear as five findings in
this report.

Key Audit Issues
 DDA did not maximize its ability to obtain federal
funds. For example, the opportunity was lost to obtain
$3 million in federal funds due to the failure to submit
rejected claims identified during the prior audit.
 DDA lacked documentation supporting the waiting list
information reported to the General Assembly.
 Inadequate monitoring of contractors/providers
resulted in certain clients losing Medicaid eligibility
(resulting in the State paying all service costs) and in
payments for services provided after certain clients’
dates of death.
 DDA did not take timely collection action to recover
funds totaling $3.6 million from providers related to
the Wage Disparity Initiative.

Federal Funds
 DDA lost the opportunity to obtain federal funds
totaling approximately $3 million, because claims
identified in our prior audit were not corrected and
resubmitted within required federal timeframes.
(Finding 1)
 DDA did not investigate the cause of claims
rejected for eligibility reasons (e.g., a client not
eligible on the date of service). During December
2008, such rejected claims totaled $1.5 million.
(Finding 2)
 Federal funds totaling $433,000 were not
recovered due to the improper application of a
DHMH Medicaid edit to DDA claims. (Finding 2)
 DDA did not have adequate processes to ensure
that certain provider claims were submitted for
Federal reimbursement processing. (Finding 3)

Waiting List Initiative
DDA did not maintain adequate documentation
supporting waiting list information reported to the
General Assembly in January 2009 and certain
inaccuracies with the list were identified. (Finding 4)
 DDA could not provide detail for the reported
17,250 individuals waiting for one or more
services as of January 2008, which was the date
of the information used to prepare the January
2009 report.
 DDA did not perform a review of the waiting list
during our audit period to ensure that the
individual's needs and priority categories reflect
current health and home conditions. Beginning
in December 2008, DDA initiated such a review
and it noted that 250 individuals who had been
on the waiting list were actually deceased and
should have been removed from the list.

Client Resource Coordi n ators (CRCs)
DDA did not ensure that CRCs performed required
eligibility assessments for certain clients, resulting in
lost federal Medicaid eligibility and in certain instances
payments for deceased clients. (Finding 6)
 An OLA test of a DDA report of clients who lost their
Medicaid eligibility identified 72 clients who lost
eligibility because the CRCs did not perform the
required reassessment. These clients were
subsequently funded solely with State funds.
 DDA also did not monitor the CRCs to ensure that
they met with clients, as required by State
regulations. Had DDA ensured that such meetings
occurred, it could have been alerted to certain
improper provider billings and payments. For
example, (as noted in Finding 7) we identified 7
providers that received $235,000 for 8 clients who
were deceased on the dates services were
reportedly provided.

Wage Disparity Initiativ e
DDA did not take timely action to recover $3.6
million from providers for its Wage Disparity Initiative.
(Finding 10)
 For fiscal years 2005 – 2007, DDA annually
obtained reports of the amount spent to increase
wages of direct service workers for private
providers to determine whether the funding was
used for its intended purpose. However, DDA did
not take any action to recover funds not used for
the Initiative’s purpose until December 2008. At
such time, DDA billed providers for $3.6 million.
As of May 2009, $2.9 million remained
uncollected.
 Legislation passed in 2001 required DDA to
increase private provider rates to reduce the
disparity between direct service workers for
private providers compared to similar employees
in State institutions. The increased funds were to
be used exclusively for this purpose.

Other Issues
A DDA report to the General Assembly did not
disclose that, after completing the Transitioning
Youth Program, clients received full DDA services,
bypassing individuals that had been on the
waiting list for longer periods of time (e.g., over 20
years) and with potentially more severe needs.
(Finding 5)
DDA did not have adequate procedures to verify
that clients in the Family and Support Services
and the Individual Family Care programs received
required services. Programs for these programs
during FY 2009 totaled $41 million, primarily from
general funds. (Finding 8)
Proper security had not been established to
control access to DDA’s provider consumer
information system (PCIS2) as well as to restrict
the capabilities of users. (Findings 11 – 12)

Conclusion
DDA needs to:
maximize the recovery of federal funds, promptly
investigate and resubmit rejected claims, and
ensure that assessments of client Medicaid
eligibility are conducted, as appropriate.
maintain documentation to support information
reported to the General Assembly and ensure the
accuracy of the reported information.
monitor the work of contractors and the services
performed by providers for compliance with
related legal requirements.
collect amounts due from providers and establish
proper controls over its automated provider
consumer information system (PCIS2).
