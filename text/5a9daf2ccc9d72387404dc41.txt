Overview of Repeat Audit Findings
 OLA issues about 50 fiscal compliance audit
reports each year containing about 150
recommendations.
 Virtually all recommendations are accepted by
agencies.
 As of June 2006, 40% of findings were repeated
in the first subsequent audit report.
 As of June 2018, 24% of findings were repeated
in the first subsequent audit report, indicating
significant improvement since 2006. Since 2013,
the overall repeat percentage has been relatively
stable; the number of repeat findings, which had
been declining the past few years, also appears
to have recently stabilized (See Exhibit).
 As of June 2018, 6% of findings were repeated
after the second subsequent audit, which
represents no change from the previous year.

Follow-up Processes for Repeat Audit Findings
 State Government Article, §2-1224(h) requires
agencies with 5 or more repeat audit findings to
provide
• an initial status report to OLA on corrective
actions taken on all findings within 9 months of
the related audit reports and, thereafter,
• quarterly status reports until satisfactory
progress has been made on all findings, or until
the next audit begins.
 Budget bill language and committee narrative (Joint
Chairmen’s Report), instituted annually since the
2013 Session, has restricted the appropriations for
agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings until
• Corrective action has been taken by the agencies
for the repeat findings, and
• OLA submits reports on its determination
regarding the actions taken.

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process
 From 2006 to October 2010, 38 audit reports
(involving 28 agencies) had five or more repeat
findings, requiring these agencies to submit
quarterly status reports, which are subject to OLA
desk review.
 From October 2010 through December 2016, for 3
of the 4 audit reports that had five or more repeat
findings, the status report process has concluded.
• For those 3 audits, the agencies collectively
reported that 3 of the 36 findings had not been
resolved; the subsequent audits found that 5
findings were actually unresolved.
• For the 4th report, the next fiscal compliance
audit report is being drafted, which will identify
the actual resolution status of all prior findings.
 During calendar years 2017 and 2018, 4 audit
reports had five or more repeat findings and have
also been subject to the more comprehensive JCR
follow-up process and/or the OLA follow-up review
process for agencies with unsatisfactory ratings.

JCR Follow-up Process - Background
 Beginning with the April 2013 Joint
Chairmen’s Report, in response to JAC
concerns, the Chairmen of the Senate Budget
and Taxation Committee and the House
Appropriations Committee instituted a
process to restrict funding for agencies with
four or more repeat audit findings, until the
submission of a report by OLA on the status of
related corrective actions.
 The annual amount of funds restricted for
each agency generally is $100,000, but has
recently ranged from $50,000 to $250,000.
 The determination of whether to release
funding is at the sole discretion of the budget
committees.

JCR Follow-up Process – Recent Results
 The April 2017 Joint Chairmen’s Report (JCR)
contained budget bill language restrictions for 2
agencies with four or more repeat audit findings.
• Based on OLA’s review, the 2 agencies
collectively addressed 7 of the 8 findings.
• The restricted funds were fully released for both
agencies.
 The April 2018 JCR contained budget language
restrictions for 6 agencies (see chart on page 7).
• Presently, all 6 agencies have submitted the
required status reports.
• OLA will review these reports and will report our
conclusions regarding the corrective actions
taken on the collective 33 repeat findings to the
budget committees within 45 days prior to the
end of fiscal year 2019.

4 findings.

Conclusion
 We believe that the various follow-up processes
provide useful tools to compel State agencies to
generally take meaningful corrective action to
implement audit recommendations.
 Since 2006, the overall percentage of repeat
audit findings has decreased from 40% to 24%
in 2018. Since 2013, the percentage of repeat
findings has remained virtually unchanged. The
number of repeat findings had been declining
but has leveled out.
