Audit Overview
(cid:190) OPSB directs the development of State personnel
policies, administers the health care benefit
programs for State employees and retirees, and is
responsible for other personnel-related programs.
(cid:190) Health benefit payments have increased from $890
million to $993 million from FY 05 to FY 08.
(cid:190) The State pays claims for participants enrolled in
health care plans administered by PPO’s, certain
services rendered by point of service (POS) providers,
prescription drug and mental health plans. For all
other POS services and services provided by HMO’s,
the State is fully insured and pays a premium (such
as a capitation fee) for medical costs.
(cid:190) The report included 14 findings, 5 of which were
repeated from the preceding audit report.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) OPSB did not adequately administer the contract
with its former pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).
Certain discounts and rebates totaling as much as
$10.8 million were not received by the State.
(cid:190) OPSB had not taken actions to determine whether its
former PBM, which had engaged in “drug switching”
activities for other insurance plans, had conducted
such activities under the State’s prescription drug
plan, thus leading to higher and unnecessary costs.
(cid:190) OPSB had not pursued recovery from one of its third-
party plan administrators of potentially fraudulent
health care claim payments totaling $534,000, nor
resolved certain claim payments with various
administrators totaling $3.7 million that OPSB
subsequently identified as potentially ineligible.
(cid:190) OPSB did not receive timely certain final reports
prepared by a private firm hired by OPSB to audit the
State’s health plan benefit administrators.
(cid:190) Certain IT controls were not sufficient.

Inadequate Oversight of Prescription Drug Program
(cid:190) OPSB did not ensure it received all contractual drug
discounts from its former pharmacy benefit
manager. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) OPSB’s audit firm issued a draft report in March
2008 which stated that for Plan Years (PY) 2005
and 2006, the State only received discounts
from the average wholesale drug prices of
46.7% and 48.7%, respectively, instead of the
required discounts of 56% and 50%.
(cid:131) Although these differences represented drug
overpayments, the firm did not calculate or
quantify the overpayment amounts in its report.
After OLA brought this matter to OPSB’s
attention, the firm advised OPSB that the State
made overpayments totaling as much as $10.1
million.
OPSB advised that it will not attempt recovery until
the firm issues its final report. A similar finding was
included in our prior report.

Oversight of Prescription Drug Program
(cont’d)
(cid:190) OPSB’s former PBM did not provide the State with
required drug manufacturer rebates totaling
approximately $700,000 for PY 2006. (Finding 2)
A report from OPSB’s contract auditor incorrectly
concluded that the State received all rebates for
PY 2006. OLA review of the contract audit report
found that the State received rebates for mail
order and retail prescriptions, totaling $6.6 million,
but not an additional $700,000 representing the
guaranteed minimum rebate for each prescription
filled.
OPSB and its contract audit firm agreed with the
OLA analysis and in September 2008, OPSB billed
the prior PBM $700,000, which had not yet been
collected as of December 1, 2008.

Oversight of Prescription Drug Program
(cont’d)
(cid:190) OPSB had not taken action to determine whether its
former PBM had engaged in drug switching activities
with respect to Maryland’s prescription drug plan.
(Finding 3)
Specifically, OPSB had not pursued this issue even
though legal action was taken by Maryland’s Attorney
General (AG) in this area. AG’s from Maryland and
other states reached a legal settlement with the PBM
for allegedly engaging in such activities with respect
to other insurance plans. The PBM was required to
pay $38.5 million to the participating jurisdictions
(including $2.4 million to Maryland).
It was alleged that drug switching increased patient
co-pays and prescription claim costs to health benefit
plans by encouraging physicians to change patients’
prescriptions.

Inadequate Monitoring of Claim Payments
(cid:190) OPSB did not adequately pursue recovery for
claims paid totaling $534,000 related to apparent
fraudulent medical claims submitted by certain
State employees. (Finding 6)
In August 2007, OPSB’s third party administrator
(TPA) acknowledged that its claims processing
system failed to flag these claims for investigation
prior to payment.
An investigative firm hired by the TPA concluded
that 21 claims were paid, totaling $534,000,
related to claims submitted by four State
employees during periods of travel outside of the
USA from January 2000 through December 2005.
OPSB terminated health care benefits for the
three individuals still employed, but it did not
pursue recovery from the TPA until OLA brought
this matter to OPSB’s attention nor verify the TPA
corrected the related claim processing problems.

Inadequate Monitoring of Claimant Eligibility
(cid:190) OPSB did not adequately follow up and resolve
certain claim payments identified as potentially
ineligible. (Finding 7)
(cid:131) During its automated post claim review process,
OPSB identified $146 million in potentially
ineligible claim payments during PYs 2005
through 2008. OPSB reviewed $46.3 million of
such claims, without concluding as to the
eligibility of $3.7 million (8%). From that 8%, OLA
reviewed claims totaling $883,000 and found 47
paid claims totaling $131,000 for ineligible
participants.
(cid:131) No reviews were conducted for the remaining
$100 million. In this regard, potentially ineligible
claims reviewed by OPSB were not selected
based on materiality, which could improve
effectiveness and efficiency.
Similar conditions have been commented on in
reports dating back to 1997.

Audits of Health Plan Administrators
(cid:190) OPSB did not receive timely and complete audit
reports related to the State’s health benefit plan
administrators. (Finding 8) For example,
(cid:131) As of June 30, 2008, OPSB had not received
final audit reports for any of the State’s 13
health benefit plans applicable to the years
ended June 30, 2005 and 2006 which were due
to OPSB no later than January 31, 2008.
(cid:131) Draft audit reports contained various errors and
omissions. In one report, the auditor had not
calculated, and did not disclose, significant
overpayments made by OPSB’s pharmacy
benefits manager, as identified in Finding 1.
(cid:190) OPSB did not adequately monitor the qualifications
of personnel assigned to the audits and, on several
occasions the audit firm replaced, without OPSB’s
approval, certain personnel (including the Audit
Manager) with lesser-qualified personnel. (Finding 9)

IT Security Issues /Inadequate Cash Controls
(cid:190)Controls over key OPSB information systems were not
sufficient to protect sensitive employee and systems’
information.
(cid:131) For the Benefits Administration System - used to
support health care benefits provided to over
110,000 employees, retirees, etc. – certain actions
were not taken to monitor security events, such as
failed access attempts. (Finding 10)
(cid:131) Certain personnel data and user authentication
information were transmitted by the OPSB’s web-
enabled personnel transaction application (PTA) in
an unencrypted format, and operating system
passwords and account controls for the PTA server
did not meet the minimum State requirements.
(Finding 11).
(cid:190)Cash receipts, which totaled $50.8 million in FY 2008,
were not adequately controlled. For example, certain
duties were not separated and deposits were not
independently verified. (Finding 13)

Conclusion – OPSB should…
(cid:190)Improve monitoring of the PBM contract to ensure
that all contractually required discounts and
rebates are obtained timely. Determine whether the
former PBM engaged in drug switching activities.
(cid:190)Establish appropriate procedures to ensure that
claim payments are made only for eligible plan
participants and costs, and take action to recover
overpayments.
(cid:190)Ensure that audits of the State’s health benefit
plan administrators are completed and the results
are reported in accordance with contract terms.
(cid:190)Establish appropriate controls over its automated
information systems to safeguard operations and
sensitive data.
(cid:190)Ensure that adequate procedures and controls are
in place over cash receipts.
