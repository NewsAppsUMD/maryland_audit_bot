REPORTS FOR WHICH COMMITTEE ACTION IS RECOMMENDED
SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
JANUARY 1, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2008
1) University System of Maryland – Bowie State University (BSU) (1/17/08 – 26 pages – 15
findings)
• Sufficient access and security controls were not in place over significant computer
applications, including academic and financial systems. For example, critical network
devices were not adequately secured, computer access to sensitive personal and
financial information of students and employees was not sufficiently restricted, critical
software supporting significant BSU systems was out of date, and adequate back-up
procedures were not in place for critical devices.
• Certain students with outstanding balances were permitted to attend classes in violation
of Board of Regents policy.
• BSU did not always transfer delinquent student accounts to the State’s Central
Collection Unit in accordance with specific regulations established for BSU.
• Adequate procedures and controls were not established over non-cash credit
adjustments, student refund payments, and electronic transfers of federal funds.
• BSU did not always comply with the State’s corporate purchasing card policy
requirements. In addition, BSU lacked adequate documentation to support purchases
totaling approximately $131,000 that were made using corporate purchasing cards.
• BSU did not investigate equipment items totaling $1.9 million that were not located
during a 2006 physical inventory.

REPORTS FOR WHICH COMMITTEE ACTION IS RECOMMENDED
SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
JANUARY 1, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2008
2) Department of the Environment (MDE) (1/18/08 – 28 pages – 15 findings)
• MDE did not fully disclose to the General Assembly’s budget committees significant
computer system development and implementation issues, the existence of three
additional contracts, and significant project cost overruns related to the Enterprise
Environmental Management System contract that could ultimately reduce the system’s
functionality. In addition, project scope modifications were not referred to the Board of
Public Works.
• MDE, in conjunction with the Maryland Environmental Trust, deposited funds in a bank
that loaned funds to a private foundation for the purchase of land without obtaining two
property appraisals. The loan agreement did not require the foundation to immediately
record a conservation easement and did not provide appropriate legal remedies if the
easement was not eventually recorded.
• Certain special fund programs were not adequately monitored to ensure compliance
with applicable State laws and regulations. For example, MDE had not established
procedures to periodically reevaluate exemptions granted to wastewater facilities under
State law pertaining to the Bay Restoration Fund and did not update its database with
revisions to property and owner information for lead paint properties.
• Security standards for hazardous material facilities had not been established timely, as
required by State law. Due to the untimely adoption of these standards, MDE incurred
delays in obtaining and reviewing security audits of the facilities.
• MDE did not ensure that a strategic plan to enhance protection of the State’s public
drinking water systems was developed timely.
• Numerous computer security weaknesses were identified. For example, MDE’s internal
network was not adequately secured and controls on its firewall need improvement.

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
JANUARY 1, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2008
3) Morgan State University (MSU) (2/9/08 – 30 pages – 17 findings)
• MSU did not disclose to the Board of Public Works that $3.1 million of its $4.3 million
telecommunications hub relocation project contract represented undefined allowance
funds that lacked specific deliverables and were not subject to competitive bidding.
MSU primarily used these funds to pay for work on other unrelated construction projects
awarded to the same contractor.
• Procedures for reviewing telecommunications hub relocation project invoices were
inadequate. As a result, questionable payments of up to $2.4 million were made for
charges that were not verified or supported. These payments require further
investigation and resolution.
• Rather than initiate a new procurement, MSU processed $2.3 million in change orders
to the hub relocation project to purchase upgraded equipment and services, which was
outside the scope of the original project.
• Change orders totaling $4.1 million, relating to three MSU construction projects, were
often approved after the related work had been completed and paid for.
• Liquidated damages totaling $3.1 million were not assessed for three construction
projects that were significantly past their scheduled completion dates.
• MSU did not always meet its minority business enterprise goals, and did not document
that all construction project inspections were completed.
• Adequate payroll processing procedures were not established, resulting in improper
salary overpayments totaling $121,400. MSU also did not report these instances to the
appropriate State authorities, as required.

JANUARY 1, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2008
4) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA)
(5/21/08 – 20 pages – 11 findings)
• MHA did not ensure that federal reimbursement rates for certain services corresponded
to the related rates paid to providers. As a result, federal funds totaling $1.15 million in
federal reimbursement were not requested for claims paid in calendar year 2006.
• Eligible provider claims were not always submitted for federal reimbursement within the
timeframe required by federal regulations.
• MHA lacked adequate procedures for systematically reviewing, as required by State
regulations, authorization decisions made by the administrative service organization
(ASO), which provided benefit management services for MHA.
• MHA did not ensure that the ASO performed the number of inpatient facility claim audits
required by its contract.
• Interest income totaling $1.8 million earned on funds used by the ASO to pay provider
claims was not transferred to the State’s General Fund as required.
• Independent reviews of provider claims paid by the ASO did not include certain critical
verification procedures, such as determining whether claims paid entirely by State funds
were eligible for federal reimbursement.
• Sufficient action was not taken to recover provider advances totaling approximately
$737,000 that had been outstanding for a number of years.

5) Maryland Department of Aging (MDOA) (6/17/08 – 20 pages – 10 findings)
• MDOA did not adequately monitor certain Waiver for Older Adults Program
responsibilities delegated to the local Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Fiscal year 2007
payments under the Program totaled $72.9 million for 3,513 participants. As a result,
MDOA lacked assurance that services provided to participants remained cost neutral,
that services received were authorized, and that participant eligibility determinations and
redeterminations were performed timely.
• Audits of AAAs were not always performed timely and audits of AAAs and providers
were not always adequately documented.
• MDOA did not request reimbursement of federal fund expenditures in a timely manner,
resulting in a loss of interest income to the State of approximately $811,000.
• Annual financial reviews of grants awarded to the AAAs were not completed timely for
fiscal years 2005 through 2007.
• MDOA did not adequately review the program monitoring activities delegated to the
AAAs for certain State grants.

6) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Family Health Administration (FHA)
(7/18/08 – 24 pages – 8 findings)
• FHA did not take any substantive action when a vendor failed to attain a national
certification for Maryland’s Cancer Registry, as required by the contract. In addition,
certain registry data under the control of the vendor was determined to be deliberately
altered to indicate that numerous individuals had cancer when they did not.
• Grants awarded to certain local public health departments and academic institutions
from the Cigarette Restitution Fund (CRF) were not adequately monitored by FHA.
FHA did not conduct annual site visits to verify that grantees had complied with program
goals and fiscal requirements nor take action when grantees did not meet performance
requirements. FHA’s grant expenditures from the CRF totaled $38.4 million in fiscal year
2007.
• FHA did not submit the required reports to the Governor and General Assembly
detailing, in part, the effectiveness of the CFR programs in a timely manner.
• Several deficiencies were noted regarding the processing of Breast and Cervical Cancer
Diagnosis and Treatment Program claims, which totaled $12.6 million in fiscal year
2007. For example, claims processed for payment using system overrides did not
receive supervisory review.
• FHA did not properly monitor and account for grant funds awarded to Prince George’s
Hospital Center, in accordance with State law.

7) University System of Maryland – University of Baltimore (UB) (7/18/08 – 22 pages – 11
findings)
• UB did not properly reconcile its automated accounting records with the related records
of the State Comptroller.
• UB did not adequately monitor and control access to critical transactions on its
automated system, resulting in numerous individuals being improperly granted the
ability to process such transactions.
• Appropriate action was not always taken by UB to pursue collection of outstanding
student accounts. In addition, UB did not always maintain accurate student account
balances.
• Independent verifications were not performed of student residency status
determinations and financial aid awards, residency status determinations were not
adequately supported, and student refund checks were not adequately secured.
• UB did not establish sufficient access and security controls over its significant computer
applications, including the student administration and financial systems.
• Contractual services payments were not always made in accordance with the related
agreements, resulting in overpayments to the vendors.

JANUARY 1, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2008
8) Department of Natural Resources (DNR) (8/1/08 – 26 pages – 13 findings)
• DNR did not adequately account for its special funds to ensure that they were used in
accordance with statutory requirements. DNR allocated expenditures for its special
funds primarily based on amounts budgeted. As a result, there was a lack of
documentation that expenditures charged to various special funds conformed to the
purposes of enabling legislation. Special funds expenditures totaled $386.8 million
during fiscal year 2007.
• DNR improperly retained certain security interest filing fees totaling $244,117 that
should have been reverted to the State’s General Fund.
• Certain Program Open Space grants were awarded to local jurisdictions for indoor
recreation projects that did not appear to be consistent with statutory restrictions.
• DNR loaned $400,000 from the Land Trust Grant Fund to a private foundation which
appears to be in violation of State law, and did not obtain required assurances that the
land purchased with the loan would be used as intended.
• DNR improperly created purchase orders to avoid reverting unspent appropriations, in
violation of State policies and procedures.
• Numerous internal control deficiencies were noted with respect to DNR’s operations,
including public land leases, federal funds, cash receipts, payroll and equipment.

9) Department of State Police (DSP) – Aviation Command Helicopter Operations
(Performance Audit) (8/14/08 – 98 pages – 27 findings)
At the request of the Joint Audit Committee, we conducted a performance audit of certain
aspects of the DSP’s Aviation Command helicopter operations. The Command operates 12
helicopters primarily to provide emergency medical transport (medevac) and certain law
enforcement operations. The Command has 161 authorized positions and FY 2007
expenditures totaled $22.3 million. Key findings are as follows:
• Over a five-year period, helicopters were used almost exclusively for critical missions
and other uses did not appear to impact use and availability. The average number of
missions flown over that period totaled approximately 8,000 per year.
• Management’s ability to make informed decisions pertaining to helicopter availability
and maintenance was severely hindered by the lack of reliable and extensive data
systems. Based on our analysis, on 51 days during FY 2007, fewer than 8 of the 12
helicopters were available on those days due to maintenance issues.
• The Command was not able to identify the cost per flight hour, including the
maintenance costs for each repair, and the cumulative repair costs per helicopter.
Without this information, the Command is unable to reliably assess the efficiency of its
maintenance operations, including determining the optimal number of staff and when
the use of contractors for repairs is most beneficial.
• The Command did not adequately use automated inventory system features to ensure
that parts are pre-ordered and stocked to minimize downtime.
• Given the Command’s comprehensive mission profile and current staffing, the
organizational structure appears reasonable.
• Certain staffing issues have impacted the Command’s operations, the most significant
of which was turnover in key positions, including pilots and technicians. Turnover in
these positions appears to have been primarily the result of low salaries compared to
other entities.
• As a result of certain data control issues, we were unable to conclude with respect to
the reliability of the “Golden Hour” measure that indicated that for FYs 2005 and 2006,
94.81% and 94.36% of the missions were completed within the “Golden Hour” for the
respective years.
Recommended Committee Action – Hearing – Report was presented at the Committee’s
September 2008 meeting.
