Land Acquisition
The College acquired land adjacent to its campus from
an individual affiliated with the College based on the
seller’s appraisal, which specifically prohibited the use
of the appraisal by third parties and was based on
various assumptions provided by the seller. (Finding 1)
(cid:190) The College acquired 34.48 acres of land for
$1,625,300. It paid the seller $800,000 and
accepted a $825,300 charitable donation from the
seller based on the seller’s appraisal.
(cid:190) The seller’s appraisal stated that the value of the
land was based on assumptions developed by the
seller. For example, the appraisal was based on the
assumption that the land would be developed into 9
residential subdivisions, even though the deed only
allowed 6 residential subdivisions.
(cid:190) The seller’s appraisal also contained numerous
disclaimers, including statements that the report
should not be used by anyone other than the seller.

Land Acquisition (continued)
(cid:190) The College did not disclose the charitable
donation nor the seller’s appraisal to the Board
of Public Works (BPW).
(cid:190) When presented to the BPW, the College listed
the purchase price as $800,000. When
questioned by the BPW about that price, the
College presented two independent appraisals
that it obtained, valuing the land at $860,000
and $1.1 million, and which the College stated
had been used to determine the purchase price.
(cid:190) The deed was subsequently conveyed to the
College in the amount of $800,000.
(cid:190) We referred this matter to the Criminal Division
of the Office of the Attorney General.

Procurement Practices
Purchase orders were frequently prepared after the
invoices had been received. (Finding 2)
(cid:190) Our test of 15 invoices totaling $800,000
disclosed that purchase orders for 9 invoices
totaling $650,000 were not prepared until after
the invoice dates.
(cid:190) Included in this test were 3 paintings totaling
$87,300 that were originally purchased in this
manner. At the time of our testing, these
paintings could not be readily located.
Furthermore, the College may have overpaid
approximately $10,800 for the paintings.
(cid:190) Based on the College’s records, the College
processed purchase orders during our audit
period totaling at least $6.4 million after the
related invoices were received.

Food Services Contract
The College did not adequately monitor its food
service contractor. (Finding 3)
(cid:190) Required supporting documentation (such as
supplier invoices and payroll records) was not
obtained to verify the accuracy of the
contractor’s direct operating costs billed to the
College, which represented the majority of the
payments to the contractor.
(cid:190) The College did not request or obtain an annual
plan from the contractor, as required by the
contract. Such a plan includes operating
guidelines for the upcoming fiscal year, such as
proposed menus and pricing structures,
operating cost budgets, and proposed
adjustments to contract compensation.
(cid:190) During the 3-year period ending June 2009, the
College paid its food service contractor
approximately $11.6 million.

annual independent audits.
(cid:190) The fiduciary was not required to maintain a
separate bank account for the College program’s
deposits and disbursements.

$515,600 disclosed that 8 payments for
reimbursement of College-related expenses
totaling $81,600 were not supported. These
unsupported payments related to travel expenses
