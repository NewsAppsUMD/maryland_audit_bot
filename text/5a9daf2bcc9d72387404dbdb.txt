Internal Audit Function in State Agencies
Historical Perspective of OLA’s and the Committee’s Involvement
• On January 3, 1991, the Division of Audits (now the Office of Legislative Audits) issued
the results of a performance audit on State agency internal audit units. That audit
concluded that significant deficiencies and inconsistencies existed within and among the
operations of the internal audit units in the State which significantly impaired their
effectiveness and efficiency. (See Exhibit A for excerpts from that report).
• As proposed by the Joint Budget and Audit Committee (now the Joint Audit Committee),
Senate Bill 205 was passed by the 1993 General Assembly (see Exhibit B).
• Senate Bill 205 was vetoed by the Governor. While agreeing with the Bill’s concept, the
Governor indicated that it was unnecessary and the same objectives could be
accomplished by Executive Order. The Governor also expressed concern that the costs
associated with the Bill were not addressed.
• During the 1994 Session of the General Assembly, the veto was sustained. On February
4, 1994, the Governor issued Executive Order .01.01.1994.06 on State Agencies –
Internal Audits, which continues to be in effect.
