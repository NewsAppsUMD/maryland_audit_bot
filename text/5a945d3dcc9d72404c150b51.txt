Introduction and Scope
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires each
county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland to file annual
(or once every four years under specified conditions) audit reports. There were
193 local government audit reports due for fiscal year 2010 (24 counties, 153
cities and towns, and 16 taxing districts). The reports are to include financial
statements with accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions
as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented. The financial
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. We have prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide
additional information regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing
requirements.
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code requires the Office of Legislative Audits to
perform a desk review of each local government’s annual audit report for
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards.
Subsections (b) through (f) of Section 40 specify the reporting and review
requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by the counties. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is required to
review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2010 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as nine fiscal year 2009 reports (Town of Capitol Heights, Town of Eagle
Harbor, Town of Fairmount Heights, Town of Forest Heights, City of Hyattsville,
Town of Lonaconing, Town of Sharptown, Town of Westernport, and the Mount
Savage Special Taxing Area). The desk reviews were performed to accomplish
the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and accounting and
auditing standards, using a checklist for governmental audits published by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits).
4

 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances or unfavorable trends and ratios, based on analyses of financial
data over the most recent five-year period (July 1, 2005 through June 30,
2010).
 We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2010 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify
instances in which required reports were not submitted.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
Five local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal year 2010 as of
August 12, 2011. Forty-one local governments submitted audit reports after
the required filing date.
Five local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal year 2010.
Furthermore, 41 local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date. The failure of a local government to file an audit report, or a delay in
filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The submission
of audit reports after the required filing date was also noted for 21 of these 41
local governments during our preceding year’s review. Article 19, Section 40(a)
of the Annotated Code of Maryland generally requires audit reports to be filed by
November 1 after the close of the fiscal year or by January 1 after the close of the
fiscal year for those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 had not been received, as of
August 12, 2011, for the following five local governments:
1. Town of Deer Park
2. Town of Fairmount Heights
3. Town of Forest Heights
4. City of Hyattsville
5. Washington Suburban Transit Commission
We will review these fiscal year 2010 audit reports and take any follow-up action
necessary when the reports are received. The results of these reviews will be
included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2011 local government audit
reports.
The towns of Brookview, Church Creek, Eldorado, Galestown, Goldsboro,
Henderson, Hillsboro, Mardela Springs, Marydel, Queen Anne, and Templeville
requested and were granted a waiver from filing an audit report in fiscal year 2010
because the towns met the conditions for filing an audit report every fourth year
as provided for under Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code. These entities will
next be required to file an audit report for either fiscal year 2012 or fiscal year
2013. The Ellerslie Special Taxing Area had previously requested and was
granted a waiver from filing its audit report. This entity will next be required to
file an audit report for fiscal year 2011.

The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion on
one opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit, and two
other local government reports contained qualified opinions on certain
opinion units.
The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion on one
opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit and two other local
government reports contained qualified opinions on certain opinion units. The
following is a summary of these opinions.
The audit report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion (a
statement that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles) on the discretely presented component
unit opinion unit because of the omission of financial data for the Town’s
component unit. The Town’s audit report also contained a qualified opinion (a
statement that, except for the effects of the matter to which the qualification
relates, the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles) on the governmental activities opinion unit
because the Town had not measured the effect of Governmental Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 49 entitled “Accounting and Financial Reporting
for Pollution Remediation Obligations.” Thus, the Town’s financial statements
were not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as
required by State law. The Town’s audit report for fiscal year 2009 also
contained an adverse opinion and a qualified opinion due to these situations.
The audit report for the Town of North East contained a qualified opinion on the
fiduciary fund financial statements because the auditor was unable to obtain
sufficient evidence supporting the carrying value of the assets held in the
fiduciary fund or the changes in net assets of the fiduciary fund.
The audit report for the Town of Westernport also contained a qualified opinion
on the governmental activities, business-type activities, and the proprietary funds
opinion units because the Town had not accounted for its unfunded pension
liability and pension expense, along with the required disclosures, in accordance
with Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statements No. 25, 27, and 50
for the Town’s defined benefit pension plan. Thus, the Town’s financial
statements were not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles as required by State law. This area of noncompliance was also noted in
regard to the local government’s fiscal year 2009 financial statements.
Although required by our audit guidelines, the auditors for the Towns of North
East and Westernport did not submit separate letters to the Office of Legislative
Audits explaining the reasons for the qualified opinions, and the Towns’ plans to
7

--- Page 10 ---
rectify the problems to enable the auditors to express unqualified opinions in the
future.
Auditors’ reports for 14 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for 14 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The auditor’s report for
one of these local governmental units included a deficiency that was also cited
during our preceding year’s review. The following is a summary of these
deficiencies:
Number of
Area of Noncompliance
Audit Reports
Auditor did not express an opinion(s) on all opinion 7
units or on all financial statements.
Auditor’s report did not report on all required 6
information (for example, supplemental information
accompanying the basic financial statements).
Auditor’s report did not include all basic elements of an 1
audit report (that is, auditor did not include
appropriate reference to the work of another
auditor).
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires that audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. These
standards require, in part, that the auditor express an opinion(s) as to whether the
basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position, the respective changes in financial position, and cash flows,
where applicable, of the local government in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Financial statements submitted by 14 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 14 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of one of these local governments included two such deficiencies, and
8

--- Page 11 ---
the financial statements of four of these local governments included a deficiency
that was also cited during our preceding year’s review. The following is a
summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 8
presentation of net assets was improper).
All required financial statements were not presented or 7
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.
Financial statements and accompanying notes for seven local governments
did not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or in
the accompanying notes, for seven audit reports. Adequate disclosure is
necessary to facilitate the understanding of, and to provide for fair presentation of,
the financial information. The financial statements of one of these local
governments included a deficiency that was also cited during our preceding year’s
review. The following is a summary of these areas of insufficient disclosure and
the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Area of Insufficient Disclosure
Instances
Long-term debt 6
Cash and cash equivalents 1
Noncompliance with State Law
Financial statements of nine local governments contained disclosures that
cash deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required
by State law.
Financial statements of nine local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by State
law (Exhibit A). Article 95, Section 22 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires that deposits with financial institutions by local governmental units be
fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes the risk of loss of deposits in
the event the financial institution defaults.

Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for five local
governments as of June 30, 2010 and for one local government as of June 30,
2009.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for five local governments as
of June 30, 2010 and for one as of June 30, 2009 (Exhibit B). Additionally, for
the one local government noted as having a deficit as of June 30, 2009 (Town of
Fairmount Heights), the auditor’s report included an explanatory paragraph which
stated that the Town’s delinquency in making certain payments raised substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The general fund is used to
account for most of the current operating expenditures of a local governmental
unit. A general fund deficit balance represents the costs of current or past
services that will need to be financed in future periods. Consequently, a general
fund deficit may indicate a potential financial problem. Five of these six local
governments have had a general fund deficit since June 30, 2008, including one
that has had such a deficit since June 30, 2006.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Code. Subsections (b) through (f) of this Section require that certain types of
special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the county in
which the districts are located within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year, in
accordance with the rules and regulations established by the applicable county.
The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each district’s compliance with
the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting copies of these reports to
the Office of Legislative Audits.
The required reports have not been filed for five special taxing districts as of
August 12, 2011.
As of August 12, 2011, we had not received the required reports for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2010 for five special taxing districts, three of which are located in
Baltimore City and two of which are located in Anne Arundel County. Anne
10

--- Page 13 ---
Arundel County and Baltimore City advised us that they were in the process of
pursuing compliance with applicable filing requirements for these districts and
that appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding
funds).
