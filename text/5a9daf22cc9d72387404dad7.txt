DHMH – Spring Grove Hospital Center
Questionable Transactions Totaling $167,106
Were Identified Related to One Contractor
(cid:190) The bidding process used by the Center’s
Maintenance Department to award projects to
this contractor appeared to be significantly
compromised.
(cid:190) The losing bids for 12 projects totaling $43,658
were purportedly submitted by two out-of-state
contractors; however, the losing bids were all
faxed to the Department by an in-state contractor
who, in all 12 cases, was awarded the projects as
the low bidder.
(cid:190) For 21 other projects totaling $87,548, the top
portion of the bid documents were tampered with
(such as torn-off), thereby eliminating references
as from where the bids had been faxed.

Questionable Transactions Totaling $167,106
Were Identified Related to One Contractor
(cid:190) A number of other “red flags” relating to projects
awarded to this contractor were noted. For
example:
• purchased equipment items could not
always be located
• sole source procurements were awarded for
repairs that appeared to be routine in
nature, and
• $26,777 in premiums were paid for
expedited orders although the orders were
not ultimately expedited.

Projects Totaling $232,000 Were Directed To
Three Other Contractors That Employed A Specific
Individual
(cid:190) The Maintenance Department directed work
totaling approximately $232,000 to three other
contractors while they employed a specific
individual.
(cid:190) These contractors had not been awarded any
projects prior to, or subsequent to, the time
periods that they employed this individual. We
were advised by Maintenance Department
management that they directed work to these
contractors (without utilizing any type of
competitive process) because they liked the work
performed by this individual.

(cid:190) A number of other “red flags” relating to projects
awarded to these contractors were noted. For
example:
• sole source procurement justifications were
inadequate, and
• for one of the projects awarded, the losing
bid was submitted via fax by the
aforementioned individual although this
individual (at that time) worked for the
contractor that was the winning bidder on the
project.

Personal Relationships Between Employees and
Contractors
(cid:190) Contractors were awarded projects that had personal
relationships with two Maintenance Department
employees and a senior management employee
outside the Maintenance Department. No projects
had been awarded to these contractors prior to the
employment of these employees.
(cid:190) For example, a Maintenance Department supervisory
employee and an executive of a certain contractor
resided at the same home address at the time projects
totaling approximately $25,000 were awarded to this
contractor. The executive of the contractor was also
named as the primary beneficiary of this supervisory
employee’s State pension benefits. For one project
awarded to this contractor, in which a competitive bid
process was purportedly used, the losing company’s
bid was printed from the supervisory employee’s email
account.

Personal Relationships Between Employees and
Contractors
(cid:190) A senior management employee was married to
the president of an organization of contractors.
We noted that this senior management employee
authorized three no-bid projects totaling $6,560
for interior design services to a firm whose owner
served as an associate board member of the
aforementioned organization. We also noted
that various registration fees totaling $4,450
were paid by the Center to the organization.

Potential Conflict of Interest
(cid:190) Despite a previous agreement to the contrary with the
State Ethics Commission, a DGS management employee
continued to maintain oversight responsibilities related to
a contract involving the firm that employed this
employee’s spouse for a seven-month period. During that
period, DGS made payments totaling $183,000 to the
firm.
(cid:190) Once the aforementioned contract expired, the same
management employee participated (played a key role in
price negotiations) in a new contract totaling $4.3 million
awarded to another firm that subsequently employed the
management employee’s spouse. Subsequent to the
spouse’s employment, the management employee
approved contract billings totaling $3.1 million.
(cid:190) The management employee did not disclose with the
State Ethics Commission, as required, that the spouse
was employed by an entity doing business with the State.

MDOT-Maryland Transit Administration
Transit Operation Fare Box Revenues
(cid:190) Keys used to access bus fare boxes and safes were
not adequately safeguarded and accounted for.
Furthermore, MTA did not maintain a complete
inventory of such keys or document the employees
to whom keys had been issued.
(cid:190) Due, in part, to the aforementioned conditions, in
January 2008 the MTA referred to the OAG –
Criminal Division a matter concerning unusual
usage of certain critical keys by an unauthorized
employee to access fare box collections.
(cid:190) MTA did not utilize reports generated by its
automated fare box system to ensure that recorded
fare collections were subsequently deposited. The
collections recorded on the reports disclosed
differences totaling approximately $475,000 when
compared to the cash deposited for the period we
reviewed from March 2007 through June 2007.
