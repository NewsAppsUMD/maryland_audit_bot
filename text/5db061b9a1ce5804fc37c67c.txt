Reports Recommended for Committee Action
January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019
1) Department of Human Services – Family Investment Administration (FIA) (3/21/19 – 23
pages – 8 findings, including 4 repeats)
 FIA improperly allowed recipients to continue receiving Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA)
benefits beyond the allowable lifetime maximum of five years. Federal and State
regulations limit each TCA recipient’s benefits to a five-year lifetime period, unless the
recipient was granted a hardship exemption. Our test of 10 recipients that had received
TCA benefits for up to 14 years beyond the five-year limit disclosed that FIA did not have
documentation of hardship exemptions on file for any of these recipients. When questioned
about this matter, FIA management advised us that it believed that these recipients qualified
for hardship exemptions, but that these exemptions were not documented. According to
FIA records, during fiscal year 2016 an average of 1,900 recipients each month had been
receiving benefits for more than five years which, based on the lowest TCA benefit, would
cost at least $6.6 million annually.
 Although FIA had established numerous computer matches designed to help ensure
recipient eligibility and detect potential fraud, FIA did not ensure that the local departments
of social services (LDSSs) conducted timely or appropriate follow-up. For example, our
tests disclosed that appropriate action had not been taken for 29 of 31 match results from
the comparison of FIA benefit recipients with other states’ public assistance and federal
records. In addition, documentation was not retained to explain the disposition of match
results.
 FIA did not take adequate follow-up action when LDSSs failed to conduct the required
number of quality assurance reviews designed to help ensure compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements, including eligibility for various assistance programs.
 FIA did not adequately monitor costs and deliverables for contracts and agreements, and
did not verify that certain grant funds were spent as intended. Our testing disclosed 12
payments totaling $14.6 million for which FIA had no evidence that the deliverables were
received or that the amounts invoiced were proper.
 FIA did not adequately restrict or review employee access to its Office of Home Energy
Programs automated system, resulting in several hundred employees with unnecessary
access to recipients’ personally identifiable information.

2) Department of Human Services (DHS) – Local Department Operations (LDO)
(6/7/19 – 24 pages – 8 findings, including 4 repeats)
In accordance with State law, the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) performed the
statutorily required financial and compliance audits of the 24 local departments of social services
(LDSSs) during our audit period. To avoid duplication of work, we relied primarily on the audit work
performed by the OIG, and many of the findings are based on the results of the OIG’s audit reports.
 Our review of the most recent audit reports for each of the 24 LDSSs prepared by DHS’ OIG
disclosed that the reports collectively included 259 audit findings, including 73 deemed by
the OIG to be repeats. The OIG audit findings were related to deficiencies in controls over
the following critical areas of LDSS operations.
o Fiscal management activities, including bank accounts, procurements, and gift cards.
o Lack of compliance with critical Family Investment Administration policies, such as those
intended to ensure the propriety of recipient eligibility for public assistance and food
benefits.
o Lack of compliance, accountability, and control related to critical Social Services
Administration policies, including child and adult protective services, and the out-of-home
placement program.
o User access to critical computer systems.
 The OIG did not routinely include comprehensive reviews of certain critical procurement and
disbursement processes in the scope of its audits of the LDSSs, including a review of
contract monitoring procedures to ensure the receipt of deliverables. As a result, we
conducted an on-site review of certain procurement and disbursement processes at two
LDSSs, and our review disclosed monitoring deficiencies and instances of non-compliance
with certain procurement requirements at one of these LDSSs. Specifically, this LDSS did
not effectively monitor a $15.3 million contract for medical case management for children in
out-of-home placements, did not prepare adequate sole source justifications for a number of
procurements tested, and intentionally split two procurements into smaller amounts to avoid
review and approval by the central DHS Contract Processing Unit.
 The OIG did not refer all instances of possible criminal or unethical employee conduct to the
appropriate State authorities as required. For example, the OIG had not referred 20
instances to either DHS Legal Counsel or to the Office of the Attorney General – Criminal
Division as required.

3) Maryland State Department of Education – Division of Early Childhood (DEC) (9/6/19 – 17
pages – 4 findings, including 1 repeat)
DEC is responsible for all child care programs in the State, including licensing facilities,
monitoring facility compliance with regulations, and taking enforcement actions related to child
care facilities. DEC is also responsible for the Child Care Subsidy Program, which provides
financial assistance to eligible families to meet their child care needs. Our review generally
found that while DEC had processes in place in a number of areas, these processes were not
comprehensive and, consequently, did not ensure that sufficient safeguards existed to protect
children in the care of the regulated facilities. We noted the following deficiencies.
 DEC headquarters did not provide sufficient oversight to ensure that the regional offices
were effectively monitoring child care facility compliance with criminal background checks
(CBC) and child protective services (CPS) clearance check requirements. Our tests
disclosed numerous instances in which employees had not obtained required CBCs or CPS
clearances, and in which alerts of subsequent criminal activity were not subject to sufficient
follow-up.
 DEC headquarters did not ensure that regional offices conducted comprehensive annual
inspections of child care facilities, followed up with facilities regarding the correction of
deficiencies, and took appropriate administrative action when the facilities did not correct
deficiencies.
 DEC did not effectively monitor its child care subsidy program vendor to ensure that proper
eligibility determinations were made, subsidy payments were proper and supported, and
contract performance measures were met.
 DEC lacked assurance that the Child Care Administration Tracking System (CCATS) was
sufficiently protected against operational and security risks. Specifically, DEC personnel
advised us that CCATS’ primary service provider had not obtained required independent
security reviews of CCATS and, independent security review reports for a critical CCATS
hosting subcontractor had not been requested.
