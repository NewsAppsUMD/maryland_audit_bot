Annapolis, Maryland
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland Department of
Transportation (MDOT) – Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) for the
period beginning December 17, 2018 and ending January 31, 2023. MAA is
responsible for the operation, maintenance, protection, and development of the
Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) Thurgood Marshall Airport and the
Martin State Airport, and operates a program to foster, develop, and regulate
aviation within the State.
Our audit disclosed that MAA did not establish formal guidelines on acceptable
marketing expenses incurred by its concessions management vendor to ensure the
fund was used for its intended purpose. Our review of the vendor’s reported
marketing fund expenses totaling $2.8 million over a four-year period disclosed
payments from the fund totaling $333,000 that did not meet the stated purpose of
the fund or appeared to be of a questionable nature. For example, the vendor used
the marketing fund to sponsor a sporting tournament in 2020, 2021, and 2022
with payments totaling $125,000.
In addition, MAA did not obtain documentation to support the propriety of
payments for janitorial and shuttle bus services under two contracts valued at
$205 million. MAA paid $21.7 million under these contracts as of April 2023.
Furthermore, MAA did not adequately justify a convenience stores contract
modification that significantly changed the financial terms and removed the
Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) requirements
for one site, which may not have been in the best interest of the State.
Additionally, for a second convenience store site, MAA did not monitor the

--- Page 4 ---
vendor’s compliance with ACDBE requirements and did not sufficiently verify
the propriety of rent payments made by the vendor.
Finally, our audit included a review to determine the status of the four findings
contained in our preceding audit report. We determined that MAA satisfactorily
addressed three of the four prior audit findings. The remaining finding is repeated
in this report.
MDOT’s response to this audit, on behalf of MAA, is included as an appendix to
this report. We reviewed the response to our findings and recommendations, and
have concluded that the corrective actions identified are sufficient to address all
issues.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the audit by
MAA. We also wish to acknowledge MDOT’s and MAA’s willingness to
address the audit issues and implement appropriate corrective actions.
Respectfully submitted,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) is responsible for the operation,
maintenance, protection, and development of the Baltimore/Washington
International Thurgood Marshall Airport and the Martin State Airport, and
operates a program to foster, develop, and regulate aviation within the State.
MAA is governed by the Maryland Aviation Commission which consists of ten
members, including eight members who are appointed by the Governor with the
advice and consent of the Senate, the Secretary of Transportation who serves as
the Chairperson, and the Secretary of Commerce who serves as a nonvoting
member.
According to the State’s records, MAA’s expenditures totaled approximately
$270.1 million (special funds of $252.4 million and federal funds of $17.7
million) during fiscal year 2022 (see Figure 1 on the following page). Special
fund revenue generated by airport operations (such as customer facility charges,
airport concessions, and a portion of parking revenue) totaled approximately $275
million, of which $227.2 million related to operating revenue and $47.8 million
related to capital financing revenue. The State’s Transportation Trust Fund funds
the amount by which operating expenditures exceed special fund operating
revenue, and funds capital projects as needed.

Referrals to Our Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Hotline
During our audit fieldwork, we received two referrals to our fraud, waste, and
abuse hotline that included four allegations related to questionable actions
involving MAA’s procurement and subsequent contract modifications of a
convenience stores contract. Based on our determination of the associated risk,
we performed a detailed review of the procurement and modifications for this
contract which extended our fieldwork until December 2023.
As noted in our findings below, although we did not substantiate any of the
allegations, we found that certain components were factually accurate. These
components when combined with findings 3 and 4 in this report raise questions
about the propriety of the overall procurement of the contract and subsequent
modifications, and in our opinion, do not present a compelling case that the
contract was in the best interest of the State.

Findings and Recommendations
Concessions Management Vendor Contract
Finding 1
Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) did not establish formal
guidelines on acceptable marketing fund expenses incurred by its concession
management vendor. Our review of the vendor’s reported expenditures
disclosed that it used the fund for certain expenses which did not appear to
support the intended purpose of the fund.
Analysis
MAA did not establish formal guidelines on acceptable marketing fund expenses
incurred by its concession management vendor and did not ensure the fund was
used for its intended purposes. The vendor provided MAA with annual marketing
fund reports and supporting documentation detailing the fund’s expenses during
calendar years 2019 through 2022. According to the vendor reports, during
calendar years 2019 through 2022, marketing fund collections and expenses
totaled $2.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
MAA did not have formal guidelines for appropriate use of the marketing funds
which are contributed by concessionaires based on a percent of their gross
receipts. The vendor contract states that the purpose of the marketing fund is to
allow the vendor to cover the cost of marketing and promotional activities (such
as customer service and satisfaction training, advertising, and special event
promotions) intended to potentially have a positive impact on the sales of the
entire concessions program. Without specific guidelines, the purpose defined in
the contract is subject to interpretation and could be used by the vendor for
activities that are not consistent with the intent of the fund.
Our review of the vendor marketing fund reports during these years disclosed
expenses categorized as community relations totaling $394,431, and we
determined that approximately $333,000 of these expenses were of a questionable
nature. For example, the vendor disclosed payments totaling $125,000 to sponsor
a sporting tournament held in Baltimore during calendar years 2020, 2021, and
2022, and $30,000 to sponsor a gala at a museum in 2019 and 2022. The
vendor’s report indicated that these payments would have a positive impact on the
community and a potential economic impact on the airport. Although MAA
advised that it reviewed the report, MAA did not question the reasonableness of
this assertion in conjunction with the stated purpose of the fund or obtain vendor
documentation indicating the effectiveness of these events on the entire
concessions program.
7

--- Page 10 ---
A similar condition was commented upon in our preceding audit report, including
the use of marketing funds to sponsor a sports tournament. In response to that
report, MAA reviewed the $552,000 expenses we questioned (which included
$391,000 categorized as community relations) and recovered $262,000 from the
vendor, including certain payments for community relations. In addition, MAA
indicated that it would closely monitor the marketing fund and reported expenses,
and recover unauthorized expenses from the vendor. However, as noted above,
MAA could not adequately justify certain expenses, including payments for
community relations.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MAA
a. establish formal guidelines on allowable community-related expenses to
ensure that they appear to have a direct relationship or benefit to the
concessions program consistent with the stated purpose of the fund;
b. review the annual marketing fund reports and obtain supporting
documentation to ensure the fund was used as intended (repeat); and
c. immediately pursue recovery of all fund expenses that are inconsistent
with the stated purpose of the fund, including the identified payments
noted above (repeat).
Contract Monitoring
Finding 2
MAA did not obtain available supporting documentation to verify the
propriety of amounts paid on two contracts for janitorial and shuttle bus
services.
Analysis
MAA did not obtain available supporting documentation to verify the propriety of
amounts paid for certain contracts. Specifically, our test of three multi-year
contracts valued at approximately $250 million related to the operations of the
airport (janitorial, shuttle bus, and parking services) disclosed that MAA did not
obtain supporting documentation to ensure the propriety of amounts paid on two
contracts (janitorial and shuttle bus) valued at $205 million. MAA paid the
vendors primarily based on hourly labor charges without obtaining available
supporting documentation (such as time records of hours billed for the janitorial
contract and bus route logs for the shuttle bus contract) to verify the propriety of
these payments. The respective contracts provided MAA access to these
documents upon request. We obtained the supporting documentation for certain
charges from the two vendors for five invoices covering activity during the period
8

--- Page 11 ---
from October 2022 through January 2023 and did not identify any material
improper payments.
MAA entered into a five-year contract for janitorial services effective September
2022, valued at approximately $130 million, and a five-year contract for shuttle
bus services effective September 2021, valued at approximately $75 million.
According to the contract terms, approximately 85 percent and 100 percent of the
respective contract values are based on hourly labor charges. According to MAA
records, as of April 2023 payments for the janitorial and shuttle bus contracts
totaled $11 million and $10.7 million, respectively.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that MAA obtain available supporting documentation to
verify the propriety of amounts invoiced by vendors, at least on a test basis,
including those noted above.
Convenience Stores Contract
Background
We received two referrals to our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline that included four
allegations pertaining to questionable actions by MAA involving the
procurement1 and modification of a convenience stores contract. The
procurement was initiated in March 2019 for two convenience store sites at the
Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI). See
Figure 3 on the following page for the two sites’ approximate locations. The
Request for Proposals (RFP) and subsequent contract provided for the design,
development, financing, construction, management/operation, and maintenance of
a convenience store with a gas station (Site 1). The RFP also provided for the
redevelopment, management/operation, and maintenance of the existing
convenience store and gas station (Site 2). MAA received proposals from three
vendors, but subsequently rejected two vendors after concluding the proposals did
not meet the technical and/or financial requirements of the RFP.
1 As a revenue-producing contract to benefit the public at a State transportation facility, this
procurement was exempt from the requirements in Division II of the State Finance and
Procurement Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland and State procurement regulations.

After receiving approval from the Board of Public Works (BPW) in January 2020,
MAA awarded the contract to the remaining vendor, which was also the
incumbent vendor at Site 2. The resultant contract included a 25-year term for
Site 1 beginning after construction of the new facility, and a 10-year term for Site
2 commencing immediately upon execution of the contract. Rent under the
contract was based on the greater of 5.75 percent of gross sales or minimum
monthly guarantees of $10,000 for Site 1 and $7,500 for Site 2. Although the
contract contained no State Minority Business Enterprise participation goals, the
vendor was required to maintain Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise2 (ACDBE) participation during the contract that was equal to 25
percent of total gross revenues. See Exhibit 1 for the Board of Public Works
agenda item and meeting transcript for the convenience stores contract.
2 The federal ACDBE Program is administered by the Federal Aviation Administration under 49
U.S.C. 47107(e). According to C.F.R. Title 49 Subtitle A Part 23, primary airports are required
to set goals for participation by disadvantaged businesses of at least 10 percent in airport
concessionaires. ACDBE participation is calculated on an airport-wide basis, and goals are not
required for each contract awarded by an airport. The law does not penalize airports for failing
to meet overall goals, but they must administer their ACDBE program “in good faith.”
Regardless of the provisions in the federal law, MAA’s establishment of specific performance
requirements in the vendor’s contract were intended to be enforceable.
10

--- Page 13 ---
MAA subsequently executed two modifications to the contract, both of which
were approved by the BPW. The first modification executed in February 2021
eliminated the federal ACDBE requirements on Site 1, changed the rent on Site 1
to a fixed annual amount of $400,000 (subject to $20,000 increases every 5-year
period), and approved the subletting of Site 1 to another vendor. The
modification also retroactively changed the financial terms for Site 2 by
eliminating the minimum monthly guarantee and basing rent payments solely on
5.75 percent of gross sales during the period from April 2020 through December
2020 (in consideration of COVID-related travel reductions impacting operations).
A second modification was executed in September 2021 that extended the pre-
construction period of the contract for Site 1 to coincide with the execution of the
sublease in August 2021.
In December 2021, a formal protest was submitted to MAA by one of the rejected
vendors, which among other concerns, raised issues with the modified financial
terms and ACDBE participation goals in relation to its own proposal. This protest
was rejected by MAA, which primarily cited the vendor’s noncompliance with the
RFP’s financial proposal requirements as the reason that vendor’s proposal was
rejected. As of October 2023, almost four years after the contract’s initial
approval, construction and redevelopment had not commenced on Site 1 and Site
2, respectively. We were advised by MAA that Site 1 construction delays were
primarily related to jurisdictional zoning issues between MAA and Anne Arundel
County, and the delays with Site 2 were due to litigation between the vendor and
its prior subcontractor at that location under the previous contract.
Referrals to Our Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Hotline
Based on the referrals to our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline, our Fraud
Investigation Unit reviewed four allegations pertaining to questionable actions by
MAA involving the aforementioned procurement and modifications of the
contract. The concerns raised in the referred allegations primarily related to Site
1, which as noted above, had not started construction. Our review of the specific
allegations disclosed the following:
Allegation 1 - MAA improperly rejected a vendor’s proposal because it
requested a waiver of the ACDBE goal and intentionally deceived the vendor
by stating the ACDBE goal was mandatory.
Based on our review of the procurement documentation, the primary reason that
MAA rejected the vendor’s proposal was because the vendor’s proposed revenue
contribution did not meet the criteria in the RFP and would produce lower
revenue to the State than the awarded vendor. Although the vendor’s failure to
provide sufficient evidence of good faith efforts to meet the ACDBE goal was a
11

--- Page 14 ---
contributing factor in MAA’s rejection of the vendor, it was not presented by
MAA as the primary reason for the rejection. In other words, the revenue
contribution issue alone was deemed by MAA as sufficient basis for the rejection.
Our review also did not disclose any evidence to support that MAA intentionally
deceived the rejected vendor by claiming the ACDBE goal was mandatory.
Allegation 2 - MAA made false statements to the BPW by indicating that
federal ACDBE rules did not permit a waiver of the requirement and that it
had to select the awarded vendor because it was the only vendor to meet the
requirement. In addition, MAA did not give one of the bidding vendors an
opportunity to demonstrate it had used good faith efforts to achieve the
ACDBE goals.
Based on our review of the BPW meeting transcript where the contract was
approved, MAA stated that the ACDBE rules impacted the number of vendors
that were interested in bidding on the contract and that one of the losing vendor’s
failure to meet the ACDBE requirement was a consideration in the rejection of the
vendor’s proposal3 (see Exhibit 1). MAA also stated that the vendor was
disqualified because it included a condition in its financial proposal that violated
the terms of the RFP. We further noted that during the bid evaluation process,
this vendor was provided opportunities to submit evidence of its good faith efforts
to meet the ACDBE goal. Initially, MAA negatively assessed the vendor’s efforts
of good faith during the technical evaluation but ultimately decided to accept the
vendor’s ACDBE efforts and moved forward with an evaluation of the vendor’s
financial proposal.
Allegation 3 - MAA significantly modified the terms of the awarded contract
from the original RFP requirements based on negotiations with the winning
vendor that were already occurring when the initial contract was presented
to the BPW for approval.
Based on our review, we concluded that the first modification did make
significant changes to the terms of the contract, but based on available
documentation, we did not find evidence that MAA negotiated these changes with
the awarded vendor concurrently with the initial contract’s presentation to BPW
for approval. As noted above, the first modification eliminated the ACDBE goal
at Site 1, changed the financial terms for the Site 1 rent payment from a
percentage of sales to a fixed monthly payment, and allowed the awarded vendor
3 During the BPW meeting, MAA agreed with the Governor’s statement that other vendors
interested in bidding on this procurement had “dropped” due to the ACDBE requirement and
that the winning vendor was the only qualifying bidder because its proposal met the ACDBE
requirement.
12

--- Page 15 ---
to sublet Site 1 to a third-party vendor. The modification also retroactively
eliminated the minimum monthly payment on Site 2 for the period from April
2020 through December 2020 and based payments solely on 5.75 percent of gross
sales.
From our review of available documentation, it appears that these changes were
developed several months after the initial contract was approved by the BPW.
We did note that there was an erroneous effective date of February 24, 2020,
included in the first modification, which may have resulted in the allegation. As
further detailed below, this date was a typographical error and the actual effective
date of the modification was February 24, 2021.
Allegation 4 - MAA waited a year after the modification was executed to
obtain approval from the BPW.
As noted above, the effective date on the first modification was recorded as
February 24, 2020. We were advised by MAA that this was a typographical error,
and the actual effective date was February 24, 2021. Our review of the related
documentation substantiated that the modification was executed on February 24,
2021, which occurred after BPW had approved the modification.
Although we did not substantiate any of the allegations in their entirety, we found
that certain components of the allegations were factually accurate. These
components when combined with the findings noted below raise questions about
the propriety of the overall procurement of the contract and subsequent
modifications, and in our opinion, do not present a compelling case that the
contract was in the best interest of the State. Our review did not identify any
matters that warranted a referral to the Office of the Attorney General’s Criminal
Division but did identify contractual procurement and monitoring deficiencies
that we believe require corrective action by MAA, as further described in the
findings below.
Finding 3
MAA did not adequately justify a contract modification that significantly
changed the financial terms and removed the ACDBE requirements for Site
1. Our review of the support for the modification disclosed that the changes
may not have been in the best interest of the State.
Analysis
MAA did not adequately justify a contract modification that significantly changed
the financial terms by lowering State revenue attainment for the entire term of the
contract and removed the ACDBE requirements for Site 1. Our review of the
13

--- Page 16 ---
support for the modification disclosed that the changes may not have been in the
best interest of the State.
Change in Financial Terms
MAA modified the terms of the contract in a manner that may not have been in
the best interest of the State by applying a limited short-term financial projection
to the entire 25-year term of the contract. In February 2021, MAA modified the
financial terms for Site 1 from a percentage of sales to a fixed monthly fee.
MAA’s justification for modifying the contract was primarily based on its
projection that convenience store sales would be reduced by 50 percent due to the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, MAA calculated that over the
initial five-year period of the contract, revenue it was to receive under the original
contract terms would decrease from $3.2 million in its original projections to $1.6
million. Under the modified financial terms, MAA projected that revenue it
would receive during the same period would total $2 million.
Our review disclosed that this modification may not have been in the best interest
of the State. Specifically, MAA changed the financial terms of the entire 25-year
contract term based on the 5-year projections during the COVID-19 pandemic
that forecasted 50 percent lower convenience store sales. However, as noted in
Figure 4 below, which is based on data posted on the BWI website, post-COVID
travel is rebounding and increasing. Furthermore, a subsequent modification
extended the amount of time the vendor had to construct the site, which would
further minimize the impact COVID-19 would have on convenience store sales.
As noted above, as of October 2023 construction on Site 1 had not commenced.

Source: BWI website
MAA also considered several other factors in deciding on the modification
including the volatility of fossil-fuel prices and the shift toward electric vehicles,
which may impact the convenience store’s revenues. However, in our opinion,
14

--- Page 17 ---
these factors were not COVID-related and were known to be relevant future
issues at the time of the original contract procurement.
Elimination of ACDBE Requirements
MAA also eliminated the ACDBE requirements on Site 1 without having
documentation that it was in the best interest of the State or minority business
enterprises to do so. According to MAA management, it removed the ACDBE
requirements because the vendor claimed that other franchise chains were
unwilling to bid on the opportunity to sublet the site from the vendor due to the
ACDBE requirements and percentage of sales payment structure. MAA could not
provide documentation that it had evaluated the vendor’s efforts to meet the
ACDBE requirements or had obtained support for the vendor’s assertions.
Given the concerns noted above and the fact that work on Site 1 had still not
started as of October 2023, we believe that MAA should have either maintained
the existing contract terms or cancelled the contract (or at least the portion related
to Site 1) and rebid the contract with new terms. We were advised by MAA that
procuring separate contracts for Sites 1 and 2 was considered prior to the initial
procurement of this contract, but it was ultimately decided to combine the sites
into one contract based on the results of a revenue study commissioned by MAA
in 2017.
Recommendation 3
We recommend that MAA
a. after consulting with legal counsel, perform analyses of the
aforementioned contract and determine whether it is in the best interest
of the State to cancel and reprocure the contract or separate the two sites
into separate contracts; and
b. in the future, maintain documentation to support that any contract
modifications are in the best interest of the State.
Finding 4
MAA did not monitor the vendor's compliance with ACDBE requirements
and did not sufficiently verify the propriety of rent payments made by the
vendor for Site 2.
Analysis
MAA did not monitor the vendor's compliance with ACDBE requirements and
did not sufficiently verify the propriety of rent payments made by the vendor for
Site 2.
15

--- Page 18 ---
MAA Did Not Monitor Compliance with ACDBE Requirements
MAA did not monitor the vendor’s compliance with ACDBE requirements for
Site 2. The contract provided that the vendor was to maintain an ACDBE
participation of 25 percent of projected total gross revenues and submit to MAA
quarterly and annual reports of ACDBE participation. The contract further
provided that if the ACDBE requirements were not met and the vendor did not
provide MAA with documentation that it made good faith efforts to achieve the
requirements, then MAA could impose a fine of $350 per day.
Our review disclosed that MAA did not obtain the required quarterly and annual
reports from the vendor. Specifically, we noted that the vendor operated without
certified ACDBE participation during the period from October 31, 2022, through
August 8, 2023, and MAA could not provide documentation that it had received
and evaluated documentation of good faith efforts by the vendor to achieve the
requirement. Therefore, based on our calculation, MAA could have assessed
fines totaling $98,350.
MAA Did Not Sufficiently Verify the Propriety of Rent Payments
MAA did not sufficiently verify the propriety of rent payments made by the
vendor for Site 2. The contract required the vendor to submit independent audit
reports to MAA each year with an opinion on the completeness and accuracy of
revenues collected by the vendor and payments due to MAA. Our review
disclosed that MAA suspended the audits during calendar years 2020 through
2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and did not implement other
procedures to routinely verify the propriety of rent payments which resulted in
certain improper payments going undetected.
Specifically, MAA only reviewed two payments from April 2020 to December
2022 and mistakenly verified that those two rent payments were in accordance
with the prior (pre-January 2020) contract with the vendor, rather than the current
contract. Since MAA did not sufficiently verify the propriety of the rent
payments, it did not identify that all the vendor’s rent payments for Site 2 during
the period from April 2020 through December 2020 were based on the financial
terms of the vendor’s prior contract with MAA, rather than the January 2020
contract resulting in overpayments by the vendor of approximately $94,000.
While MAA did not identify that these vendor payments were incorrect, the
overpayments were eventually corrected in February 2021 when MAA processed
adjustments to account for the retroactive changes in financial terms included in
the first contract modification.

Recommendation 4
We recommend that MAA
a. monitor compliance with all contract requirements, including ACDBE
participation;
b. take appropriate action for instances of noncompliance with contract
requirements, including those noted above; and
c. verify that all rental payments are accurate in a timely manner.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland Department of
Transportation (MDOT) – Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) for the
period beginning December 17, 2018 and ending January 31, 2023. The audit
was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine MAA’s financial
transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance with
applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included procurements and disbursements for architectural
and engineering, construction, revenue, and operating contracts; operating
expenditures; as well as cash receipts. Furthermore, we reviewed the
procurement and subsequent contract modifications of a convenience stores
contract based on referrals received on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline. We
also determined the status of the findings contained in our preceding audit report.
Our audit did not include certain payroll support services (such as processing of
personnel transactions and maintenance of employee leave records) provided by
MDOT – The Secretary’s Office to MAA. These payroll support services are
included within the scope of our audit of MDOT. Our audit also did not include
an evaluation of internal controls over compliance with federal laws and
regulations for federal financial assistance programs and an assessment of MAA’s
compliance with those laws and regulations because the State of Maryland
engages an independent accounting firm to annually audit such programs
administered by State agencies, including MAA.
Our assessment of internal controls was based on agency procedures and controls
in place at the time of our fieldwork. Our tests of transactions and other auditing
procedures were generally focused on the transactions occurring during our audit
period of December 17, 2018 to January 31, 2023, but may include transactions
before or after this period as we considered necessary to achieve our audit
objectives.
18

--- Page 21 ---
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, tests of transactions,
and to the extent practicable, observations of MAA’s operations. Generally,
transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgment, which primarily
considers risk, the timing or dollar amount of the transaction, or the significance
of the transaction to the area of operation reviewed. As a matter of course, we do
not normally use sampling in our tests, so unless otherwise specifically indicated,
neither statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was used to select the
transactions tested. Therefore, unless sampling is specifically indicated in a
finding, the results from any tests conducted or disclosed by us cannot be used to
project those results to the entire population from which the test items were
selected.
We also performed various data extracts of pertinent information from the State’s
Financial Management Information System and MDOT’s Financial Management
Information System (such as revenue and expenditure data), as well as from the
contractor administering the State’s Corporate Purchasing Card Program (credit
card activity). The extracts are performed as part of ongoing internal processes
established by the Office of Legislative Audits and were subject to various tests to
determine data reliability. We determined that the data extracted from these
sources were sufficiently reliable for the purposes the data were used during this
audit. Finally, we performed other auditing procedures that we considered
necessary to achieve our objectives. The reliability of data used in this report for
background or informational purposes was not assessed.
MAA’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records;
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including safeguarding of assets; and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved. As
provided in Government Auditing Standards, there are five components of
internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities,
information and communication, and monitoring. Each of the five components,
when significant to the audit objectives, and as applicable to MAA, were
considered by us during the course of this audit.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
19

Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes findings relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect MAA’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. Our report also includes findings regarding significant instances of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Other less significant
findings were communicated to MAA that did not warrant inclusion in this report.
The response from MDOT, on behalf of MAA, to our findings and
recommendations is included as an appendix to this report. As prescribed in the
State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we will advise MDOT regarding the results of our review of its response.

Excerpt of Meeting Transcript from the January 29, 2020
Board of Public Works Meeting
Auditor Note: The transcript included unrelated discussion about other topics at
the airport. We did not include the transcript for these unrelated topics in the
Exhibit.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: Item 1.
TREASURER KOPP: Yes, exactly. Item 1.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: Yeah. So this is a lease and concession contract,
Mr. Secretary, for the design, development, and financing, construction
management, and maintenance of two gas station and convenience locations
within the BWI Marshall complex. I guess my concern is how did we end up after
a competitive bid RFP, how did we end up with a single bid contract to an out-of-
state developer?
GOVERNOR HOGAN: That’s a very good question.
MR. SLATER: Good morning. We have Executive Director for Maryland
Aviation Ricky Smith, as well as our superstar Director of Commercial
Development Jaimine Erskine.
MR. SMITH: Good morning, Governor, Treasurer, Madam Comptroller. So the
Airport spent a number of years trying to figure out ways to expand our non-
airline related revenue base. And so we have a five-acre lot that’s on Amtrak
Way. It’s adjacent to the Amtrak station across from Northrup Grumman, where
there are hundreds of employees who look for gas station related services. And
it’s also close to our rental car facility, where we also have customers that are in
dire need of gas station facilities. So we decided to launch a procurement to entice
a developer to come in and offer gas station services, as well as convenient food
services at that location.
So during the procurement, we initially did a survey to try to get a feel for what
the marketplace would want in order to find ourselves an attractive procurement.
And so in that survey, the feedback we got was, one -- if I can back up a little bit,
we also have another gas station on the north side of the Airport. That lease is
expiring and so we had both considerations that we had to deal with. And so, the
feedback we got from the survey was that the marketplace would rather have the
24

Page 5 of 10
two combined as one solicitation because they didn’t want the competition, and
also the economies of scale would make it a more attractive opportunity for them.
And so when we put it out on the street, we actually got three responders. One of

explaining the
reasons for
MR. SMITH: And so we were down to just one. The one firm that we are
selecting the
recommending is the firm that currently operates the gas station, the BWI gas

station on the north side of the Airport. This firm also operates gas stations across
and the
the country at airports. They specialize in airport related gas station
ACDBE
developments. And so that’s how we came down to one. Our preference –
participation
requirement.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: My understanding is, and correct me if I’m wrong, this is
a very unique situation. Because unlike a typical State procurement, we’re dealing
with federal law that required this, the Airport Concession Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise, ACDBE participation –
MR. SMITH: Correct.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: -- of 25 percent.
MR. SMITH: Correct. So all airport –
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Which is, only applies to these airports, right?
MR. SMITH: That is correct, Governor.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: And so the bid went out. I think maybe Royal Farms and
Wawa both were interested.
MR. SMITH: That’s correct.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: And as soon as they said they had to comply with this
federal law, they both dropped.
25

Page 6 of 10
MR. SMITH: Including Sheetz as well, yes.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: And only one, who only does airports –
MR. SMITH: That’s correct.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: -- is the only bidder. Because no one else can meet that
requirement.
MR. SMITH: That’s correct.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: So it has nothing to do with State procurement or our bid
process. It’s federal law.
MR. SMITH: Right. Their structure just doesn’t allow for participation in the
Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Business Enterprise.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: No, that would explain why 11 of the 14 that
were interested did not bid.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Yeah.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: But I guess my question is, was that identified
when you first went out and surveyed the group?
MR. SMITH So that was not identified as an issue when we did the survey. But
after we did the procurement, we did follow up with a couple firms and they
identified the ACDBE requirement as an issue that they just could not –
GOVERNOR HOGAN: That’s a pretty aggressive goal. That seems to be hard for
any, you know, there are not very many companies that can comply.
MR. SMITH: So the 25 percent goal is the goal that’s on the existing gas station –
MS. ERSKINE: Correct.
MR. SMITH: -- contract that we have. And so we thought it would be obtainable.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: And that’s the incumbent –
GOVERNOR HOGAN: -- incumbent protection -- (Laughter.)
26

Exhibit 1

Page 7 of 10
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: -- to steal my lines. No. No, I guess my
question, Mr. Administrator, is did you give any consideration after the two of the
three bids were ruled unresponsive, and you ended up with the incumbent with the
single bid contract that’s before us, did you give any consideration to rebidding
this? And perhaps splitting it into, rather than both of them together, separately?
And try to produce some competition?
MR. SMITH: So we did give that consideration. There were two factors. One, the
marketplace had already told us that combining the two would make it most
attractive. Second, we have an existing procurement and we have an existing
contract, a lease, with the gas station company on the north side of the Airport
that is expiring. As a matter of fact, I believe it’s on a month-to-month now.
MS. ERSKINE: Mm-hmm.
MR. SMITH: And so we needed to complete the procurement in time to satisfy
that contract.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: Okay. But this is a fairly lucrative contract,
because, and it’s important to the State. We get 5.75 percent of the gross sales
goes to the State. So how long are these leases going to be in this obviously
attractive, high traffic, busy location? How long are the leases for?
MR. SMITH: So there are two terms. The term for the new location, the Amtrak
location, is 25 years. The term for the existing location on the north side is ten
years, because the Airport’s expansion plans extends the terminal into that area.
And so we want to have the flexibility to end that contract, get out of that contract
to support the expansion.
TREASURER KOPP: When you issued it, what were your projections or
assumptions about the long term profits?
MR. SMITH: Well going into the procurement, we didn’t necessarily have a –
TREASURER KOPP: How much do you get now on the one north –
MR. SMITH: On the existing gas station -- yeah, we don’t have it off the top of
our head. I think it’s -- I don’t know the number off the top of my head.

GOVERNOR HOGAN: Can I ask you this? There were 14 potential bidders.
Eleven of them just dropped out right away because they said we can’t comply
with this federal law.
MR. SMITH: Right. Correct.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: The other ones tried to bid and couldn’t comply. How far
off were the bids? The one, the only bidder that could meet the federal, was that,
financially was that a much different bid from the ones who couldn’t comply?
MS. ERSKINE: No, well the ones that submitted a bid, and Royal Farms was one
of those bidders, because they conditioned their proposal, we were counting fuel
sales and non-fuel sales. And that was part of the RFP, that was a requirement.
And so the condition to say, you know, a lot of large companies don’t want to
give up their fuel (indiscernible). And so that was one of the concerns that we
had, that, you know, we’re not actually maximizing the revenue to the State.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: My point is, if we somehow changed the federal law, is it
going to dramatically change the financial revenues to the State by saying we can
get other bidders instead of having a one non-bid, no competition contract with
somebody that’s the incumbent?
MS. ERSKINE: Yeah, if the FAA regulation didn’t stipulate the 25 percent, then
yeah, I mean, that would certainly open it up.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Maybe that’s what we should work on.
TREASURER KOPP: Of the other airports, do any of these firms, the 11 firms, or
the other three, not have facilities at airports?
MR. SMITH: Not every airport has this kind of development. I did a similar
development in my previous life in Cleveland. We didn’t get a lot of responses to
that as well because of the federal requirement, one. Also, this company just
seems to specialize in creating relationships with the airport community to drive
business at its locations.
TREASURER KOPP: I thank you. I really don’t, I mean, I use the train station a
lot and the Airport. It is a perfect location for a gas station. I just –
28

Exhibit 1

Page 9 of 10
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Couldn’t you also get around that issue by surplussing
the property and realizing the value? You know, so you would get the benefit of
all that revenue and it wouldn’t be part of the Airport concession anymore.
MR. SMITH: So there’s a, we’re talking a lot about the FAA. So the FAA
requires that airports maximize revenues on its properties. So if we, it has been
determined that this is the best approach to maximizing revenues in the Airport as
opposed to just selling off the property.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Okay.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: So I have a lot of confidence in the Airport’s
leadership. Thank you for running a very successful State-owned Airport.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: They are breaking records every month.
MR. SMITH: Mm-hmm.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: Yeah, no, it’s –
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Number one Airport in the region.
MR. SMITH: That is correct.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: And they also have good customer service, so
thank you guys.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: It keeps beating the heck out of Dulles. I like that.
(Laughter.)
MR. SMITH: Yeah, we are, we are winning Dulles, yes.
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: Let me ask you a question, though, Mr.
Administrator. Was there, when you put this out to bid, was it part of the bid RFP
that they had to do the Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
participation program? That was in the contract?
MR. SMITH: So prior to putting the RFP on the street, we first have to get the
FAA to approve the procurement document. And yes, this was included in that
solicitation document.

Page 10 of 10
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: Okay. So not to be overly candid, but even
though I don’t like the single bid contracts given to incumbents, I’m going to vote
for this. But part of it’s that you guys are apparently on, at all hands on deck with
this Coronavirus and you have enough things to deal with up there. That’s my
basic rationale. Not that it makes any sense to anybody, but that’s my view right
now. But if you could suggest some ways for us to avoid this particular federal
program, whatever it is, that seems to cut down on the ability to have competition,
I would be grateful.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Any other questions on Transportation?
COMPTROLLER FRANCHOT: Move approval.
GOVERNOR HOGAN: Second? Three-nothing. We’ll move on to Department of
General Services.

Concessions Management Vendor Contract
Finding 1
Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) did not establish formal guidelines on
acceptable marketing fund expenses incurred by its concession management vendor. Our
review of the vendor’s reported expenditures disclosed that it used the fund for certain
expenses which did not appear to support the intended purpose of the fund.
We recommend that MAA
a. establish formal guidelines on allowable community-related expenses to ensure that
they appear to have a direct relationship or benefit to the concessions program
consistent with the stated purpose of the fund;
b. review the annual marketing fund reports and obtain supporting documentation to
ensure the fund was used as intended (repeat); and
c. immediately pursue recovery of all fund expenses that are inconsistent with the stated
purpose of the fund, including the identified payments noted above (repeat).
Agency Response
Analysis
Please provide The marketing fund is established in the contract with the concession
additional comments as management vendor and is comprised of fees paid by sublessees. There
deemed necessary. are no State funds in the marketing fund. The contract provides for
allowed uses of the fund, to include “marketing and promotion of the
Overall Concession Program at the Terminal or on any item or service
that may enhance the overall passenger experience at the Terminal
related to concessions”. Specifically, the concessions contract provides
for the “types of expenses that may be paid out of the Joint Marketing
Fund shall include, without limitation…” (emphasis added). As required
by the contract, both the sublessees, who contribute to the fund, and the
MAA, receive annual reports on the use of those funds. Stipulating
additional requirements regarding the allowed use of these funds
requires a contract modification.
Recommendation 1a Agree Estimated Completion Date: Spring 2024
Please provide details of The marketing fund is established in the contract with the concession

funds in the existing contract requires a contract modification. The

current contract is month-to-month pending completion of the
procurement for a new contract. As a compensating control, the MAA
holds a monthly meeting with the vendor to review upcoming uses of the
marketing fund.
In September 2023, the Maryland Department of Transportation
(MDOT) issued a request for proposals for the concessions program at
BWI Marshall Airport. The request for proposals includes a sample
contract that includes additional provisions related to the marketing
fund. Under that contract, spending from the marketing fund must be in
accordance with the approved annual marketing plan and approved by
MAA, spending requires the submission of additional supporting
documentation, expenses are subject to audit by the MAA or a certified
public accountant to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract,
and additional examples of approved uses of the fund are provided.
Recommendation 1b Agree Estimated Completion Date: Complete
Please provide details of As noted by OLA, “The vendor provided MAA with annual marketing
corrective action or fund reports and supporting documentation detailing the fund’s expenses
explain disagreement. during calendar years 2019 through 2022.” The MAA reviews annual
and monthly marketing fund expenditures and requested supporting
documentation in an effort to ensure that the marketing fund
expenditures were consistent with the intended purpose of the fund as
provided for in the current contract. Additionally, MAA holds a monthly
meeting with the vendor to review upcoming uses of the marketing fund
and the vendor is instructed to obtain prior approval from MAA before
incurring new expenditures. The allowed uses of the marketing fund as
stated in the contract are broad and do not specify prohibited uses.
Although the OLA disagrees whether the noted expenses should have
been allowed, that does not mean that the expenses were not being
reviewed by MAA. As noted above, further limiting the use of funds or
changing the requirements of the marketing fund requires a contract
modification. The MDOT is currently soliciting for a new concessions
contract that includes additional provisions related to the marketing
fund.

Recommendation 1c Agree Estimated Completion Date: 9/19/2023
Please provide details of In 2019, MAA directed the vendor to cease all payments that did not
corrective action or comply with the marketing fund requirements and to reimburse the
explain disagreement. marketing fund for ineligible expenses. On August 17, 2021, the vendor
reimbursed $289,750 to the marketing fund.
On September 19, 2023, MAA requested that the vendor reimburse the
expenditures from the marketing fund identified by OLA. On January
16, 2024, the vendor disputed that the expenditures identified by OLA
did not meet the allowed uses of the marketing fund. As noted above, the
allowed uses of the marketing fund as stated in the contract are broad
and do not specify prohibited uses. Additional clarification would
require a contract modification. The MDOT is currently soliciting for a
new concessions contract that includes more specific provisions related
to the marketing fund.

Finding 2
MAA did not obtain available supporting documentation to verify the propriety of

Finding 3
MAA did not adequately justify a contract modification that significantly changed the
financial terms and removed the ACDBE requirements for Site 1. Our review of the
support for the modification disclosed that the changes may not have been in the best
interest of the State.
We recommend that MAA
a. after consulting with legal counsel, perform analyses of the aforementioned contract
and determine whether it is in the best interest of the State to cancel and reprocure the
contract or separate the two sites into separate contracts; and
b. in the future, maintain documentation to support that any contract modifications are in
the best interest of the State.
Agency Response
Analysis
Please provide The decision to modify the contract was one that involved MAA’s
additional comments as authority to determine what is best for the operation and maintenance of
deemed necessary. BWI Marshall Airport. This determination by MAA was approved by
the Board of Public Works (BPW). The decision involved balancing
potential revenue MAA may receive from a lease modification with the
premium product it was to receive in return for the modification, which
includes the first Anne Arundel County location for a growing regional
company. MAA determined that potentially receiving less revenue and
no ACDBE participation on Site 1 (while maintaining the overall 25
percent ACDBE contract goal and for Site 2) in exchange for a superior
product that would drive up sales was an appropriate tradeoff and was in
the best interest of the State. The details of the modification were
submitted to the BPW and were approved, indicating that MAA did
adequately justify the modification.
As with all solicitations and contracting matters, MAA consulted with
legal counsel on this modification. A study conducted by an MAA
consultant recommended that the two sites be combined to maximize the
economics of the development and resulting value realization to the
airport, including customer service quality and revenue.

Recommendation 3a Agree Estimated Completion Date: 10/15/2024
Please provide details of The decision to modify the contract was based, in part, on the best
corrective action or information available at the time regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on
explain disagreement. the airport industry and the projected site development timeline. The
COVID-19 pandemic had a significant and sustained impact on
operations at BWI Marshall Airport. At its lowest point, passenger
traffic was down 95 percent. Four years later, passenger operations at the
airport are reaching pre-COVID levels. The federal government
provided historic levels of federal relief funds to the airline industry and
other industries to sustain operations. Without certain contract
concessions, many more businesses would have failed.
The MAA performed an analyses prior to the contract modification to
determine if the modification was in the best interest of the State.
Canceling the current contract may create significant financial penalties
for the State and further delay development of the sites. However, given
the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued
delays in the redevelopment of the sites, the MDOT will perform a
financial, operational, and legal analyses to confirm that continuing the
current contract is still in the best interest of the State.
Recommendation 3b Agree Estimated Completion Date: 3/1/2024

Analysis
Please provide The preceding contract between MAA and the vendor included an
additional comments as ACDBE subcontractor. MAA recorded and monitored the incumbent
deemed necessary. ACDBE performance under the preceding contract’s terms and
conditions. The contract’s participation goal was 25%. On January 29,
2020, the BPW approved the new contract between MAA and the
vendor for the development of Site 1 and Site 2 at BWI Marshall
Airport. The vendor proposed a new ACDBE subcontractor, which
would replace the original ACDBE under the terms of the new contract.
When the new contract was awarded, the original ACDBE refused to
vacate the leased premises and sued the vendor, alleging improper
termination of its agreement. On May 25, 2022, the original ACDBE
was granted a preliminary injunction against the vendor. This delayed
the performance of the new contract and the redevelopment of Site 2.
After the lawsuit was settled, the vendor took over the day-to-day
operations of Site 2 and provided MAA with documentation for a
replacement ACDBE subcontractor. The new ACDBE subcontractor
was approved as an ACDBE by MDOT on August 10, 2023. According
to the terms of the contract with the vendor, the contract is divided into
three phases: a pre-construction period, a construction period, and an
operational period. The ACDBE goal requirement does not begin until
the operational period begins. Site 2 is currently under renovation, and in
the construction period of the contract. Construction is projected to be
completed on April 4, 2024. The renovation schedule for Site 2 was
designed to allow the new ACDBE subcontractor to assume operations
