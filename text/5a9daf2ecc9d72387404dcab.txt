Overview
We conducted a review of an allegation received
through our fraud hotline related to possible violations
of State budget and procurement laws and regulations
involving certain interagency agreements between MTA
and Towson University (TU).
TU’s Division of Economic and Community Outreach
(DECO)* serves as a conduit through which the
University can collaborate with businesses, non-profit
organizations, government agencies, and community
members to provide research and technical services
that create solutions addressing issues its clients are
facing.
Interagency agreements are used by State agencies to
obtain services from State institutions of higher
education and are exempt from State procurement
laws, including the requirements for competitive
procurement, publication of solicitations and awards,
and Board of Public Works’ approval.
* DECO was renamed the Division of Innovation and Applied Research on
December 1, 2012.

Overview (continued)
Our review was limited to 10 interagency agreements
between MTA and DECO for FYs 2010 through 2013.
(See Table below.) Related payments under 8 of
these agreements totaled $10.6 million, primarily
from the Transportation Trust Fund. There were other
agreements that were not subject to this review.

Overview (continued)
Under one agreement for employment services DECO
was to initially provide MTA with personnel for various
training services, although the scope was later
expanded beyond training to include a variety of
employee services. The number of personnel
included in the agreements increased from 11
individuals in 2010 to 57 individuals in 2013.
Payments were based on a fixed price for each
individual with an unspecified amount going to DECO
for administration of the contract. This agreement
was subsequently cancelled after we brought our
concerns to the attention of MDOT management.
The other nine agreements were to provide course
development and delivery of various training to MTA
personnel, with payments generally based on a fixed
price per course for development and additional fees
for each class delivered, and miscellaneous
materials.

Key Issues
Our review resulted in five findings related to the usage,
cost, documentation, and monitoring of the interagency
agreements and related expenditures.
• MTA circumvented State procurement regulations
that require competitive bidding and allowed MTA to
augment its staff beyond its budgetary positions by
using these agreements.
• MTA did not maintain adequate records of the
agreements, paid DECO invoices without adequate
support, and could not document the receipt of
certain deliverables.
• One MTA employee had unilateral control over the
agreements, including creating, approving and
modifying the agreements. Certain payments were
questionable, including a $200,000 payment to a
firm owned by the employee’s spouse.
MTA referred certain of these matters to the State
Ethics Commission prior to the start of our review. After
we notified MDOT management of our findings, MDOT
referred certain matters to the Criminal Division of the
Office of Attorney General.

Lack of Controls Over the Agreements
MTA lacked adequate controls over interagency
agreements with DECO. The use of these
agreements circumvented State procurement
regulations which require a competitive procurement
process and allowed MTA to augment its staff
beyond its budgetary positions (Finding 1).
Unilateral Control by One MTA Employee
One MTA employee had excessive control over
the interagency agreements with DECO. Specifically,
this employee had unilateral authority to create and
modify the interagency agreements, amendments,
and related task orders and was the sole MTA
signatory on virtually all of the agreements, related
amendments, and task orders during FYs 2010,
2011, and 2012. MTA subsequently determined that
this employee had violated certain State ethics laws
and was terminated in November 2012.

Lack of Controls Over the Agreements (cont.)
Circumvention of State Procurement Regulations
• MTA directed DECO to use private vendors for some
or all of the services under 3 course development
and delivery agreements. For example, DECO
subcontracted with private vendors whose services
accounted for $983,000 (91%) of the $1.1 million
MTA paid to DECO under one agreement.
• For the employment services agreement:
MTA identified the individuals who were to be hired
o
by DECO under the employment services
agreement. MTA was responsible for the daily
monitoring of these individuals, including assigning
tasks and monitoring performance. DECO had no
apparent involvement, but received a 10% fee.
Our review of 25 individuals who were included in
o
an agreement during FYs 2010 through 2013
disclosed that 19 had been previously employed by
MTA or a contractor that performed services for
MTA, including 15 who had duties under the
agreement that were similar to those performed
when employed by or for MTA.

Questionable Costs and Payment Terms
 Amounts paid for certain services under the
agreements appeared excessive or varied among
similar services (Finding 2). For example, the
employment services agreement originally provided
for an annual fee of $212,509 for one individual
which exceeded the amount the individual was
previously paid while working for an MTA contractor
($132,000). After 6 months, MTA reduced the fee.
The agreement provided for MTA to pay a fee for one
individual that was $8,900 more than the fee paid
for another person with the same job description.
 MTA’s monitoring of DECO invoices was inadequate
(Finding 3).
• For the employment services agreement, MTA paid
DECO prior to the end of each quarter and did not
verify that the related services were actually
provided.
• Amounts billed on certain invoices under the
course development and delivery agreements were
inconsistent with or not authorized in the related
task orders and were not always supported.

Questionable Deliverables
 MTA could not document that certain deliverables
were received (Finding 4).
• MTA could not provide sufficient documentation
to support the work of five individuals included
in the employment services agreement during
FY 2012 for which MTA paid DECO $571,340.
No documentation was available to support the
work performed by two of these individuals for
which MTA paid a total of $154,815. For the
remaining 3, only minimal documentation was
provided which did not adequately substantiate
the receipt of the deliverables.
• MTA could only provide minimal documentation
of deliverables for 10 invoices from the FY 2012
course development and delivery agreements
for which it paid $412,708. For example, no
documentation was available (including a list of
attendees or training materials) for charges on
6 of the invoices totaling $90,962. There was a
lack of assurance that the courses were held or
if the use of the agreements was cost-effective.

Inadequate Follow-up on Questionable Activity
MTA did not take adequate follow-up action when
questionable activities were identified regarding the
MTA employee administering the agreements
(Finding 5).
• MTA officials were notified that DECO
subcontracted the work on one agreement to a
company owned by the MTA employee’s spouse
and that the employee added certain questionable
individuals to another agreement. MTA conducted
two focused reviews that corroborated these
allegations, identified other control deficiencies,
and referred the matter to the State Ethics
Commission, which concluded that the employee
had violated the State Ethics Law.
• MTA did not conduct a thorough review of the
agreements and related expenditures, nor did it
refer this matter to the Office of the Attorney
General’s Criminal Division, until after we
discussed our concerns with MDOT management.

Inadequate Follow-up on Questionable Activity (cont.)
The lack of a thorough review of the agreements and
related expenditures by MTA is significant because
our review of the agreement which involved the
employee’s spouse, disclosed numerous
questionable transactions. For example:
• The agreement was modified several times
increasing the cost from $500,000 to $1.1 million
without any documentation or additional services
to justify the increase, and the related services all
fell within the scope of the initial agreement.
• There was little documentation for contractor and
subcontractor charges totaling $968,100
(including approximately $200,000 for work
performed by the company owned by the MTA
employee’s spouse) and the reliability of some of
that documentation appeared questionable (price
quotes from several contractors were not printed
on letterhead and were in the same font type and
size).

Conclusion
MTA should
• ensure that agreements, amendments, and task
orders are subject to independent supervisory
review and approval, and discontinue using
interagency agreements to circumvent budgetary
restrictions and procurement regulations;
• ensure adequate documentation is obtained to
enable verification of amounts invoiced, that
amounts paid are reasonable and consistent with
the agreements, and maintain adequate records
of the agreements and all related supporting
documents and payments;
• verify deliverables are received prior to making
related payments;
• review the aforementioned transactions and, in
consultation with the Attorney General, recover
amounts determined to be improperly billed; and
• in the future, notify the appropriate entities in
accordance with the Governor’s Executive Order.
