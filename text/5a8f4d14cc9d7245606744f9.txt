Background Information
Establishment and Purpose of the Fund
The Insurance Article, Section 19-802 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
established the Maryland Health Care Provider Rate Stabilization Fund effective
April 1, 2005. The law provides that the Fund will serve several purposes,
including retention of certain health care providers in the State, by subsidizing
their medical professional liability (malpractice) insurance premiums for a
specified number of years, and by increasing fee-for-service rates paid to
providers by the Maryland Medical Assistance program (Medicaid) and payments
to managed care organizations that serve that program. The Fund is administered
by the Maryland Insurance Commissioner.
The Fund consists primarily of revenues generated by an annual premium tax
imposed on health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations.
Beginning in fiscal year 2010, all Fund revenues, less certain administrative costs,
are allocated to the Medical Assistance Program Account. Revenues allocated to
this Account are paid by the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) to the
State’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to increase payments to
Medicaid providers and managed care organizations.
Prior to fiscal year 2010, a portion of the revenues was also allocated to the Rate
Stabilization Account. Revenues allocated to the Rate Stabilization Account were
paid, in accordance with established criteria, to medical professional liability
insurers who applied to MIA for rate subsidies on behalf of insured health care
providers. Although eligible subsidy requests applicable to previous years may
still be paid, no such payments were made to medical professional liability
insurers during calendar 2011.
Financial Information
On page 4 of this report is a summary of the receipts and disbursements for the
Maryland Health Care Provider Rate Stabilization Fund for the period beginning
January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2011, based on the State’s accounting
records. This summary is not intended to and does not provide the financial
position and results of operations in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Specifically, certain financial statements and disclosures
(for example, balance sheet, summary of significant accounting policies) have not
been provided as would be required had this summary been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Findings and Recommendations
Our audit did not disclose any significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of the Fund’s internal control. Nor did our audit disclose any significant instances
of noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. A less significant
finding was communicated to MIA that did not warrant inclusion in this report.
A draft copy of this report was provided to MIA. Since there are no
recommendations in this report, a written response was not necessary.
Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
As required by the Insurance Article, Section 19-808 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, we have audited the receipts and disbursements of the Maryland Health
Care Provider Rate Stabilization Fund for the period beginning January 1, 2011
and ending December 31, 2011. The Fund is administered by the Maryland
Insurance Commissioner. The audit was conducted in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
The objectives of this audit were to examine the Fund’s receipts and
disbursements and related records and internal control, and to evaluate
compliance with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
The areas addressed by the audit included cash receipts, cash disbursements, and
certain required audits of Fund activity performed by the Maryland Insurance
Administration (MIA). Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate
personnel, inspections of documents and records, and observations of Fund
operations. We also tested transactions and performed other auditing procedures
that we considered necessary to achieve our objectives.
Our audit did not include certain support services provided to the Fund by MIA.
These support services (such as maintenance of accounting records and related
fiscal functions) are included within the scope of our audit of MIA.
MIA’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control over the Fund. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial
5

records, effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of
assets, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
