AUDIT FINDING AND RECOMMENDATION
Continue to Develop and Implement Information Security Policies and Procedures
Type: Internal Control and Compliance
Repeat: Yes (First Issued in 2019)
Potomac River Fisheries Commission (Commission) has adopted the Commonwealth Information
Security Standard SEC 501 (Security Standard) to follow in implementing its information security
program. The Commission contracted with the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) for VITA
to provide required Information Security Officer (ISO) services, such as developing a business impact
analysis and a system security plan. The Commission has made substantial progress in completion of
the required analysis and plan; however, the process is not yet complete. Due to staffing changes at
VITA throughout fiscal year 2023, there were significant delays in both communications and document
completion, and the Commission continues to lack documented and approved information security
policies and procedures.
The Security Standard requires specific policies and procedures regarding access, security
awareness and training, systems audits and accountability, security assessment and authorization,
system configuration, contingency planning, identification and authentication, incident response,
system maintenance, physical and environmental protection, planning and risk assessment, and system
integrity. Industry best practices suggest that entities prepare, disseminate, and maintain information
security policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures to facilitate effective implementation of an
information security program.
The Commission should continue to be proactive in communicating with VITA to obtain the
contract deliverables, including resources to develop and formally approve information security policies
and procedures, and implement them into its information security program. Implementing information
security policies and procedures will help to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
and achieve compliance with the Security Standard.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and improve the fishery
resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership consists of eight
Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
When compared to the previous fiscal year, Commission revenues decreased by two percent;
expenses decreased by 19 percent; and net income increased overall by 269 percent. The Commission’s
revenue decrease was due primarily to federal grant activity. The decrease in expenses resulted from a
decrease in oyster planting due to environmental issues; a reduction of personnel expenses due to the
retirement of the Assistant Executive Secretary at the end of fiscal year 2022; and a 16 percent reduction
in contractual expenses. Also, Maryland increased its appropriation for the current fiscal year by $35,000
to help defray the continuing decline of individual and sport fishing licenses sold due to the ability of the
public to purchase these licenses online, which is not currently available from the Commission.

In addition to its operating cash, the Commission has several reserve accounts. The Commission
has $194,486 in the Virginia and Maryland local government investment pool accounts earmarked to
fund future oyster work under the Oyster Management Reserve and Rotational Oyster Harvest
programs. The Commission also has $542,824 in a separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree
health care reserves. The retiree healthcare account is managed by a trust and legally cannot be used
to fund operations. The Commission contributes to the retiree healthcare account annually based on
recommendations from an actuarial periodic funding study.

The Honorable Glenn Youngkin
Governor of Virginia
Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
Mr. Ronald Owens, Executive Secretary
Potomac River Fisheries Commission
Commissioners
Potomac River Fisheries Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2023. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commission’s financial system; review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls; test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and review corrective
actions of audit findings from the prior year report.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.

We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances.
Federal grant revenues and expenses
Contractual services expenses
Payroll expenses
Appropriations
Cash receipting
Capital assets
Information system security
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also tested details of
transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The financial information presented in this report
came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted one matter involving internal control and its operation and compliance with applicable
laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements that require management’s attention and corrective
action. This matter is described in the section titled “Audit Finding and Recommendation.”
The Commission has taken adequate corrective action with respect to audit findings reported in
the prior year that are not repeated in this letter.

Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on November 8, 2023. Management’s response to
the findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did not
audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
