Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) was
established to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland in Maryland.
MALPF, which is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of 13 members,
purchases land easements with Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund
(Fund) revenue and places certain restrictions on the use of the land (for example,
the land cannot be subdivided for residential or commercial purposes). The Fund,
which is administered by MALPF, generally derives revenues from State transfer
taxes, agricultural transfer taxes, local subdivision matching funds, State bond
proceeds, and federal grants. According to MALPF’s records, since inception
through June 30, 2011, it had purchased 2,043 easements on 279,223 acres of land
for a total cost of approximately $588 million.
Financial Information
Attached, as Exhibit A, is a schedule of the financial activity of the Special
Revenue Fund and Installment Contracts for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.
This schedule is not intended to, and does not provide the financial position and
results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
In addition, certain other financial statements (for example, a balance sheet) and
disclosures have not been provided as would be required by generally accepted
accounting principles. The schedule was prepared on a modified accrual basis of
accounting which provides that revenues are recognized when they become
available and measurable, and expenditures are recognized when the related
liability is incurred.
As of June 30, 2011, the total resources available to finance future expenditures
including easement acquisitions were $26,240,232. The fund balance in the
Special Revenue Fund was $8,495,479 as of June 30, 2011. The Special Revenue
Fund Balance is reserved for easement acquisitions that were approved by
MALPF’s Board of Trustees, but were not presented to the landowners as well as
offers accepted by the landowners that were awaiting Board of Public Works
approval or settlement at year end. In addition to its special fund appropriation,
MALPF received certain General Obligation bond authorizations. Accordingly,
bond funds available to finance future expenditures totaled $17,744,753 at June
30, 2011. The fund balance as of June 30, 2011 in the Installment Contract Fund
($8,426,496) represents funds committed for the payment of easements purchased
by MALPF on an installment basis.

Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the three findings contained
in our preceding audit report dated May 13, 2011. We determined that MALPF
satisfactorily addressed one of these findings. The remaining two findings are
repeated in this report.
Findings and Recommendations
Easement Acquisitions
Finding 1
The database of easement acquisitions developed by the Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) had not been tested
for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s accounting records.
Analysis
The database of easement acquisitions developed by MALPF had not been tested
for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s accounting records, and as of June 30,
2011, the cumulative cost of easement acquisitions recorded in the database ($588
million) exceeded the corresponding total in the State’s records ($557 million) by
$31 million. Consequently, there was a lack of assurance that all easement costs
were properly accounted for and recorded in the database and in the State’s
records.
MALPF’s database of easements purchased contains information such as the
number of acres purchased and the related purchase price. Similar conditions
were commented upon in our two preceding audit reports.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MALPF
a. ensure the accuracy of the critical data included in the database of
easement acquisitions (repeat), and
b. periodically reconcile the database to the related State accounting records
(repeat).

County Agricultural Land Transfer Taxes
Finding 2
MALPF did not ensure that all counties properly filed an annual report or
remitted unused agricultural land transfer taxes to the State as required.
Analysis
MALPF did not ensure that all counties properly filed an annual report or remitted
unused agricultural land transfer taxes to the State as required. All counties are
required by MALPF policy to submit annual reports that are to include
information regarding transfer taxes collected by the counties, the nature of the
counties’ use of the taxes, and whether any unexpended taxes were due to the
State. However, a review of county filings for fiscal year 2011 disclosed that, as
of December 15, 2011, MALPF had not received reports from three counties
(generally due in October), and the reports that were received did not always
include sufficient data to evaluate whether or not any amount was due the State.
Furthermore, MALPF did not have adequate procedures to establish an accounts
receivable record when funds were due from a county. Similar conditions were
commented upon in our preceding audit report.
Subsequent to our inquiries, MALPF conducted an analysis of the fiscal year
2011 reports submitted and, in February 2012, billed five counties for
approximately $1.2 million in unexpended funds. Although the majority of these
funds related to taxes collected in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, a portion of the
billings related to taxes collected in prior years dating back to fiscal year 1996.
State law requires that counties remit a specified portion of the agricultural land
transfer taxes they collect to the Maryland Comptroller for deposit into the
Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (Fund). The remaining transfer
tax is to be used by the counties for land preservation and any transfer taxes not
expended or committed on or before three years from the original date of receipt,
shall be remitted to the State for deposit into the Fund. According to the State’s
accounting records, agricultural land transfer taxes remitted to the State during
fiscal year 2011 totaled approximately $1.4 million.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that MALPF
a. ensure that annual reports are submitted on a timely and complete basis
and monitor the remission of amounts due to the State (repeat), and
b. maintain accounts receivable records for funds due the State (repeat).

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have audited the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (Fund) for
the fiscal ending June 30, 2011. The audit was conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine the Fund’s
financial transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance
with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations. We audit the Fund annually as
required by the Agriculture Article, Section 2-505 of the Code. We also
determined the status of the findings contained in our preceding audit report.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of materiality and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included disbursements for the purchase of easements, as
well as receipt of agricultural land transfer taxes, and compliance with easement
terms. Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel,
inspections of documents and records, and observations of the Fund’s operations.
We also tested transactions and performed other auditing procedures that we
considered necessary to achieve our objectives. Data provided in this report for
background or informational purposes were deemed reasonable, but were not
independently verified.
Our audit did not include certain support services provided to the Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) by the Department of
Agriculture. These support services (such as purchasing, data processing,
maintenance of accounting records, and related fiscal functions) are included
within the scope of our audit of the Department.
MALPF management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.

--- Page 9 ---
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes findings relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. Our report also includes a finding regarding a significant instance of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Other less significant
findings were communicated to the Fund that did not warrant inclusion in this
report.
The Department of Agriculture’s response, on behalf of MALPF, to our findings
and recommendations is included as an appendix to this report. As prescribed in
the State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, we will advise the Department regarding the results of our review of its
response.

Responses to Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation
Audit ending June 30, 2011
Easement Acquisitions
Finding 1
The database of easement acquisitions developed by the Maryland Agricultural Land
Preservation Foundation (MALPF) had not been tested for reliability nor reconciled to the
State’s accounting records.
MALPF has tested the database for accuracy and reliability. Procedures have been put in place to
reconcile current fiscal year purchases with the state’s accounting records. Furthermore, as part of
the MALPF’s inspection process, financial information will be verified with information
contained in the database. The Executive Director has met with the Department’s Information
Technology Director to discuss identifying an adequate test to determine the accuracy of the
financial information contained in the database. The IT Director is in the process of writing a
program to extract random properties to be placed in a spread sheet. The spread sheet will be
provided to MALPF staff and compared to the physical files. All comparisons will be made by
staff other than staff responsible for the county for which a check is being made. In addition,
settled easements have been physically verified with each county program administrator. All
testing will be completed no later than July 31, 2012. Please note that for fiscal year 2011,
easement activity contained in the database has been reconciled to the easement expenditure
information recorded in FMIS.
County Agricultural Land Transfer Taxes
Finding 2
MALPF did not ensure that all counties properly filed an annual report or remitted unused
agricultural land transfer taxes to the State as required.
The auditors noted that MALPF had not received fiscal year 2011 annual reports from four
counties during their test of all of the State’s 23 counties. Three of the counties identified are non-
certified counties. State Planning Regulations do not require non-certified counties to submit an
annual report. Montgomery County, the fourth county identified by the auditors, was late with
their submission due to major changes in their accounting system. A written explanation from the
County Program Administrator, confirming the reason for the delay, was submitted prior to
October 1st. In accordance with regulations, this was acceptable to MALPF and their deadline
was extended. MALPF will work more closely with county administrators to promote more

Responses to Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation
Audit ending June 30, 2011
timely and accurate submissions from all of the counties. Per an analysis of the annual reports
received from the counties, MALPF has invoiced six of the counties for a total of $1,217,007,
representing unspent agricultural tax revenue that is older than three years.1
1 Auditor’s Comment: In its response, the Department indicated that the audit report had noted annual reports of
transfer taxes had not been received from four counties. However, our report only commented on three counties; the
fourth county (Montgomery) was not addressed by our report. Furthermore, the response indicated that the three
counties identified are non-certified and that State regulations do not require non-certified counties to submit an
annual report. The State regulations cited in the response are not germane to the audit finding since, as noted in our
report, MALPF policy requires all counties to submit annual reports. Such reports are necessary to monitor transfer
taxes collected, the use of those taxes, and whether any unexpended taxes were due to the State.
