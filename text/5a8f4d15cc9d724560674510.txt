COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve
and improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing
Virginia.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the
following sources.
Commission Revenues
2014 2015
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000
Federal grant 50,030 50,837
Sport fishing licenses 152,103 140,003
Commercial fishing licenses 77,545 79,350
Commercial crab licenses 71,500 68,580
Commercial oyster licenses 35,030 34,230
Commercial license surcharge 34,800 34,900
Oyster bushel tax 2,317 5,016
Interest and miscellaneous 25,682 28,727
Total revenue $737,757 $730,393
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission’s revenues decreased by one percent for fiscal year 2015 mainly due to
pricing increases in the sport fishing licenses. As the Commission increased license fees to mirror
fees charged by Maryland, Virginia sport fishermen purchased licenses from the Department of
Game and Inland Fisheries instead of the Commission.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:
Commission Expenses
2014 2015
Personnel services $405,662 $398,085
Development and repletion 135,849 146,222
Federal grant 42,705 34,860
Contractual services 80,333 101,619
Materials and supplies 59,789 62,154
Insurance 14,218 (2)
Fixed assets 4,909 1,338
Operating expenses 743,465 744,276
Reserve fund deposits for:
Retiree health care 53,500 53,500
Total expenses $796,965 $797,776
Source: Commission’s financial system
Total expenses were relatively stable over fiscal year 2015, decreasing only $810 from fiscal
year 2014. This is attributable in part to the Commission’s decision to decrease funding for future
oyster development and efforts to maintain level spending. However, increasing costs coupled with
decreasing revenues could be a concern for the Commission in the future.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2015 with an operating loss of $13,883. After factoring in
the reserve expense of $53,500, the Commission’s total loss was $67,383. This is the third
consecutive year that the Commission had a net loss.
The ability of the Commission to continue to retain more cash each year is dependent on
whether they are proactive in holding down spending on operations and continue to bring in license
revenues at increasing levels, thus making funds available to set aside each year for future liabilities
and ongoing oyster programs. The Commission closed fiscal year 2015 with a cash balance of
$584,720, which was a one percent increase over fiscal year 2014 levels. The cash balance includes
$207,182 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts to fund future oyster work and
$336,278 in a separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree health care reserves as of
June 30, 2015. Both of these accounts are restricted and cannot be used to fund operations. The
Commission has traditionally maintained sufficient operating cash to cover two to three months of
expenses. Average monthly expenses, which have increased over the last several years, caused the
drop in cash balances and reduced the Commission’s operating coverage to three-quarters of a
month, a slight increase from one-half month in fiscal year 2014. The Executive Secretary and the
Board continue to monitor this situation.

The Honorable Terence R. McAuliffe
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Robert D. Orrock, Sr.,
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
And Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2015. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial
transactions in the Commission’s financial system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal
controls, test compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, and
review corrective actions of audit findings from prior year reports.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed
to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements.

We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent
of our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles,
classes of transactions, and account balances.
Capital assets Cash receipting
Contractual services expenses License revenues
Payroll expenses Federal grant revenues and expenses
Appropriations
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate,
had been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance
with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit
procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and
contracts, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We tested transactions and performed
analytical procedures, including budgetary and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with
outside parties.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts
recorded and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The Commission records its financial
transactions on the cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other
than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial
information presented in this report came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted no matters involving internal control and its operation that we consider necessary
to be reported to management. The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other
matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.
The Commission has taken adequate corrective action with respect to audit findings reported
in the prior year.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on June 1, 2016.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
