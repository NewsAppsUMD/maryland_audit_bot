Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Department of Human Resources provides
intervention services to stabilize families and
vulnerable adults; encourages financial
independence by providing temporary support
and transition services; and provides for the
welfare of children at risk.
(cid:190) DHR is organized into eight units, with the three
following units included in this audit:
(cid:131) Office of the Secretary
(cid:131) Operations Office, which provides core
administrative services to DHR units
(cid:131) Office of Information Technology for Human
Services
(cid:190) During FY 2007, expenditures for these three
units totaled $108 million.
(cid:190) The audit report included 14 findings. Eight
findings from the preceding report were repeated.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) DHR’s computer services contracting practices,
including bundling two contracts into one, may
have resulted in reduced competition and higher
contract costs.
(cid:190) Potential federal funding totaling $3.5 million
was not obtained because an IT contract
amendment was not submitted in advance for
federal approval.
(cid:190) Various other deficiencies:
(cid:131) Numerous repeat findings of inadequate
procedures and policies to protect DHR’s
critical data files and programs.
(cid:131) The Department could not justify a $31,300
lump-sum salary payment to a former official.

Computer Hosting & Maintenance Contract
(cid:190) On June 21, 2006, BPW approved a 3-year
contract valued at $110 million for hosting and
maintenance of DHR’s critical IT systems. Only
one company submitted a proposal in
response to DHR’s RFP.
(cid:190) Previously, hosting and maintenance services
were provided by different contractors under
separate contracts.
(cid:190) Bundling appeared to limit competition, as two
potential bidders for the maintenance services
advised that the combination of those services
with hosting into one contract precluded them
from bidding. (Finding 1)

Computer Hosting & Maintenance Contract (cont.)
(cid:190) The lack of competition may have resulted in
DHR paying higher prices for some services.
(cid:190) For example, in FY 2007 DHR paid $18.4
million for hosting services to the prime
contractor. That contractor paid $13.5 million
to the two subcontractors providing virtually all
of those services.
(cid:190) One of the subcontractors was the sole prime
contractor for hosting services under the prior
separate hosting contract.

Computer Hosting & Maintenance Contract (cont.)
(cid:190) Costs associated with a January 2007 contract
modification were not assessed for
reasonableness. Hourly rates for a number of IT
job categories were higher than rates
established under an existing statewide
contract with the same vendor.
(cid:190) For example, one job category was to be paid
$197 an hour under the modification, but only
$137 an hour under the statewide contract.
Under a prior DHR contract (that expired in
2006) with that vendor, the hourly rate for the
same job category was $103.

Electronic Benefits Transfer System (EBTS)
(cid:190) EBTS is used by assistance recipients to
access cash and food stamp benefits.
(cid:190) EBTS was operated by a financial institution
under a 6-year contract originally awarded in
September 2000, but extended several
times.
(cid:190) That contract expired in August 2006, but a
number of extensions have been executed
due to significant delays in preparing the RFP
for the new contract. The rates under the
extensions were significantly higher than the
rates subsequently obtained under a new
contract. (Finding 3)

Electronic Benefits Transfer System (EBTS)
(cid:190) A comparison of the extension rates and the
new contractor’s rates indicates that the delay
in procuring a new contract resulted in
increased costs, estimated at $3 million for the
12-month period ended August 31, 2007.
(cid:190) For example, under the contract extensions,
DHR paid a monthly fee of $2.56 per food
stamp recipient, while under the new contract
the fee drops to 84 cents.
(cid:190) Documentation was not available to adequately
support the evaluation committee’s review of
the proposals. The new contract (originally to
be effective September 2007) was awarded to
a bidder whose cost estimate exceeded the
incumbent’s proposal by over $1 million.

Federal Funding Issues
Federal Funds Disallowance:
(cid:190) $3.5 million in claimed federal reimbursement for
IT expenditures from July 1, 2005 to May 1, 2006
was disallowed because DHR failed to obtain prior
federal approval before executing the related
contract extension. (Finding 5)
Unsubstantiated Federal Revenue:
(cid:190) At the close of FY 2006, DHR recorded federal
revenue to offset prior TANF and foster care
expenditures of $32.2 million (going back to FY
1999), even though there were no federal funds
available to finance these costs. (Finding 6)
(cid:190) DHR advised that, as of June 30, 2007, the
amount has been reduced to $12.4 million. To the
extent that federal funds are unavailable for this
remaining deficit, State general funds will be
required.

Information Systems Security and Control
(cid:190) IT systems provide substantial support for
accomplishing DHR’s mission.
(cid:190) A number of DHR employees had unnecessary or
unrestricted access to critical data files and
programs, including those used to authorize public
assistance benefits. (Findings 7 and 8)
(cid:190) Various security software reports were either not:
comprehensive, reviewed, and/or generated
(Finding 9)
(cid:190) DHR’s internal network was vulnerable to security
risks, including unnecessary Internet access.
(Findings 10 and 11)
(cid:190) There was no comprehensive IS disaster recovery
plan. (Finding 12)
(cid:190) All 6 IS findings were repeated, whole or in part,
from the preceding report; with Finding 7 having
been in audit reports dating to 1990.

Payroll
(cid:190) A $31,300 lump-sum salary payment was made
in March 2006 to a former senior management
employee.
(cid:190) Payment represented the value of a retroactive
salary adjustment to the employee’s date of hire
in September 2004.
(cid:190) DHR justified the adjustment to DBM, by citing
an “error” in originally processing the employee’s
employment.
(cid:190) Employee’s personnel file contained no
documentation of any salary error and when
questioned by OLA, the DHR official who
prepared the justification could not explain the
nature of the error. (Finding 13)

Conclusion
(cid:190) DHR should take appropriate action to maximize
competition in its data processing procurements
and to ensure that costs are minimized.
(cid:190) DHR should initiate timely procurement processes
and fully document all aspects of those processes.
(cid:190) DHR should maximize its federal funding and
eliminate deficits.
(cid:190) DHR should take the recommended actions to
provide adequate security over its information
systems and to ensure that its disaster recovery
plan is complete.
(cid:190) DHR should maintain documentation for personnel
actions.
