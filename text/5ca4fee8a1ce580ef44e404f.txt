Dear Senator King and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office ofLegislative Audits (OLA) has conducted a review ofthe actions taken by the
Department ofHuman Services (DHS) family Investment Administration (FIA) to resolve the
—
four repeat findings in our April 9, 2015 audit report. This is the second year that a requirement
regarding repeat audit findings in this report has been included in the JCR for DHS. This review
was conducted in accordance with a requirement specified in the April 2018 Joint Chairmen ‘s
Report (JCR), page 112. The JCR required that, prior to the release of $250,000 of its
administrative appropriation for fiscal year 2019, DHS report the corrective action with respect to
all repeat audit findings on or before November 1, 2018. The JCR language further provided that
OLA submit a report to the budget committees listing each repeat audit finding along with an
assessment ofthe corrective action taken by DHS for each finding. The OLA report is required to
be submitted to allow 45 days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior to
the end ofthe fiscal year.
The April 9, 2015 audit report ofFIA contained four repeat audit findings (findings 1, 3,
4, and 5) that were addressed by four recommendations. DHS provided a report to OLA, dated
November 21, 2018, detailing the corrective actions that it had taken with respect to the repeat
findings (Exhibit 1). The DHS status report indicated that corrective action had been completed
to address findings 1, 3, and 4, and that corrective actions were ongoing for finding 5.

Delegate Maggie McIntosh, Chair
We reviewed the FIA status report and related documentation. In this regard, Finding 3
was previously determined to be resolved during our April 2017 review in response to the April
2016 JCR. The status of the remaining findings (1, 4, and 5) were determined as part of our
recently completed fiscal compliance audit of FIA dated March 21, 2019. We determined that
Finding 1 had been resolved, Finding 4 was in progress, and that FIA had not taken sufficient
actions to correct Finding 5 (Exhibit 2). Our assessment ofthe two repeat findings that had not
been resolved is included in Exhibit 3.
After discussing our review results, and consistent with its response to our March 21, 2019
fiscal compliance audit report, DHS disagreed with our conclusions on the implementation status
ofFinding 4 but agreed with the conclusions for the remaining 3 repeat audit findings. We wish
to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the review by FIA and its willingness to
address the audit issues and implement appropriate corrective action.
We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the JCR requirement. Please contact me if
you need additional information.
Sincerely,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA

Exhibit 3 to April 1, 2019 Letter to Joint Chairmen
OLA’s Assessments Regarding Repeat Findings That Were Not Resolved
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 4
—
We recommend that FIA
a. obtain adequate documentation, such as time and payroll records, to verify the
accuracy and propriety ofcontract billings (repeat).
Status: In Progress
In our March 21, 2019 audit report, we noted that FIA still did not always obtain adequate
documentation to verify the accuracy and propriety ofcontract billings. Specifically, our test of
15 invoices totaling $14.7 million disclosed that, for 12 invoices totaling $14.6 million, FIA did
not obtain documentation that agreed-upon deliverables were received and amounts invoiced
were proper. These 12 invoices were paid during fiscal years 2015 through 201$ and were
associated with five FIA contracts and agreements. During our current review ofthe status of
the repeat audit findings FIA management advised us that they implemented a new contract
monitoring document in February 2018 which would be used as a guideline for new
contracts. Training on the new guidelines will be conducted sometime in spring 2019 in
preparation for a formal implementation effective July, 1, 2019 for fiscal year 2020
contracts. Consequently, we deemed FIA’s implementation ofits corrective action to be in
progress.
In response to our March 21, 2019 audit report, FIA disagreed with our finding and stated that it
obtained certain documentation to verify the accuracy ofthe billings. However, FIA was unable
to provide us with the required activity reports or other documentation to adequately support the
propriety ofthe amounts invoiced.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 5
—
We recommend that
b. TDAP cases are closed in a timely manner once SSA renders its final decision regarding
a recipient’s application for federal benefits (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
In our March 21, 2019 audit report, we noted that Temporary Disability Assistance Program
(TDAP) cases were not closed in a timely manner. TDAP is a State-funded program that
provides assistance to low-income disabled adults who are ineligible for other categories of
assistance and who are applying for federal Supplemental Security Income or Social Security
Disability Income. TDAP benefits should cease when the federal Social Security Administration
(S$A) renders a final decision regarding a recipient’s application for federal benefits. Our test of
25 cases for which a final decision was rendered by SSA, disclosed that FIA did not close 13
cases for 1 to $ months after the SSA decisions were rendered. During that time, TDAP benefits
totaling $12,515 were paid to these individuals in violation ofthe FIA aforementioned policy.
