INTR()I)UCTION
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Thank you 11w the opportunity to preselit the results of our review of the audit reports
sLihmitted by each local government for the year ended June 30. 201 5. We l’ound that the local
governments have generally complied with generally accepted accoumitilig principles and
auditing standards. Additionally, local governments generally appeared to be in good financial
condition at that time. When areas of’noncompliance or potential financial problems were noted,
we sent letters describing the conditions to the governments and, when appropriate, to their
auditors in an effort to ensure the conditions do not recur. My presentation will address the
following areas:
I Overview ofthe local government auditing process
.
2. Problems disclosed by our review of local government audits
3. Follow-up action taken on problems
4. Concluding comments
OVERVIEW
Generally, each county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district located in Maryland
is required by law to have an annual audit. Based on the provisions ofTitle 16 ofthe Local
Government Article ofthe Annotated Code ofMaryland, each local government is required to
have its financial statements audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards. This law also requires that the financial statements
be presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the results of
the audits be submitted to the Office of Legislative Audits.
Most local governments must file their reports on or before October 3 1 for the preceding
fiscal year ended June 30; however, local governments whose populations exceed 400,000, and

--- Page 3 ---
certain other counties, must tile on or belbre December 31 of each year. In addition, extensions
may be granted to local governments fur valid reasons. By law, certain small governments may
request a waiver of the annual tiling requiremeni. and instead only have an audit once every tour
years. ihirteen local governments requested. and were granted, waivers of’ the annual tiling
requirement for 201 5.
As provided for under the law, we have issued audit guidelines that address the basic
requirements thaI must be met by the local governments and (heir independent auditors. While
the independent auditors determine the specific procedures necessary in each audit, the
guidelines are intended to help ensure that a minimum acceptable level ofquality is maintained
for audits and financial reports oflocal governments.
The 0111cc ofLegislative Audits performs a desk review ofeach audit report to determine
areas of’noncompliance by using a quality control checklist for government audits Published by
the American Institute ofCertified Public Accountants. For example, we determine whether the
auditor’s report was presented in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, whether
the local government’s financial statements were presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and whether financial statement disclosures were adequate.
Our desk review also includes a review to identify noncompliance with certain State
laws, such as Local Government Article, Section 17-101 ofthe Annotated Code ofMaryland
which requires all deposits held in banks by local governments be insured or othervvise
collateralized. Additionally, our desk review includes a basic financial analysis ofeach local
government. This analysis includes a review ofvarious financial trends and ratios (for example,
ratio ofgeneral lund balance to annual expenditures) to provide some insight regarding potential
financial problems at the local government level.

--- Page 4 ---
Upon completion of each year’s review, we prepare a report summarizing the areas of
noncompliance with the audit guidelines (for example. departures liom generally accepted
accounting principles) or with State law (for example. uncollateralized cash deposits). In
addition, our report discloses potential financial problems at the local government level such as
deficit fund balances and unfavorable financial trends and ratios. ‘I’his summary report is
submitted to the State Comptroller and the Executive Director of’the Department of Legislative
Services, as required by law, as well as other interested parties.
Finally. the law requires applicable counties to file reports with our Office on their
reviews of financial reports and audits ofspecial taxing districts created by the counties. Our
annual summary reports also include the results ofour reviews ofsuch financial information on
county—created special taxing districts.
PROBLEMS DISCLOSED:
As reflected on Exhibit A, page 1, most local governments have substantially complied
with standards over the past several years. However, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015,
about 25 percent (50 out ofthe 194 local government reports due) contained areas of
noncompliance with the audit guidelines. During our fiscal year 2015 review, the number of
local governments with areas ofnoncompliance with the audit guidelines decreased somewhat in
comparison to that ofthe preceding year.
In addition. our review disclosed areas ofnoncompliance with State law for 12 local
governments (local governments with unsecured cash deposits) and potential financial problems
for 3 local governments. See Exhibit A, page 2 for a summary ofthese areas and problems over
the past several years. Some local governments had more than one area ofnoncompliance with
the guidelines.
The more significant and frequent problems disclosed by our review were as follows:
3

--- Page 5 ---
mcliness:
I ocaI governments did not timely tile an audit report as required or tailed to do So.
As ofiuly 29, 2()1 6, Iwo local governments (Deer Park and Marydel) had not filed
an audit report for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 201 5. Seven other local
governments had not tiled an audit report ftr fiscal year 2015.
Auditor’s Work:
2. Auditor’s reports For eight local governments were not presented in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards.
Local Government Financial Presentation:
3. Financial statements submitted by 19 local governments did not present all required
statements or the presentation was inappropriate.
4. Financial statements For five local governments lacked adequate disclosures in the
statements and/or accompanying notes.
5. One report (Svkesville) contained an adverse opinion on one opinion unit and a
qualified opinion on another opinion unit. An adverse opinion slates that the
financial statements do not present fairly the financial position, changes in financial
position or, where applicable, cash flows in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. This Town’s audit report contained an adverse opinion on
the Town’s discretely presented component unit opinion unit because ofthe
omission offinancial data for the Town’s legally’ separate component unit. A
qualified opinion is issued when the auditor states that, “except for” the effects of
the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial statements are presented
fairly. The Town’s audit report also contained a qualified opinion on the
governmental activities opinion unit because the Town had not measured the effect
ofGovernmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 49 entitled
Accounting andFinancial Reportingfor Pollution Remedialion Obligations. The
“
4

--- Page 6 ---
Town’s audit reports for each fiscal year since 2009 also contained an adverse
opinion and a qualified Opinion due 10 these situations.
6. Ihe audit report for one local government (l3allimore City for fiscal ear 201 4)
contained a qualified opinion on the City’s Grant Revenue lund opinion unit
because, the auditor was unable to obtain suflicient evidential matter that supported
approximately $24 million ofunearned revenue reported in the hind.
Compllance:
7. Local governments with uninsured/uncollateralizecl cash deposits. Twelve local
governments had unsecured, or inappropriately secured, cash deposits. In most
cases, the amount ofcash not secured was small in relation to the local
governments’ total assets and, in some cases, it was indicated in the financial
statement disclosures that the local government had taken corrective action.
Potential Financial Issues:
8. Local government with unrestricted General Fund deficit balance. One local
government (Crisfield) had a deficit fund balance at June 30, 2015.
9. Local governments with unfavorable General Fund trends and ratios. Two local
governments (Henderson and Rising Sun) had unfavorable General Fund trends and
ratios for the period ending June 30, 2015.
FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS:
A letter describing the areas ofnoncompliance with the audit guidelines noted during our
review was sent to each local government and its independent auditor. The letters requested that
the matters be examined to avoid a recurrence in subsequent audits.
The local governments that failed to file audit reports for fiscal years 2013, 2014. and
2015 were reported to the Executive Director ofthe Department ofLegislative Services.
Provisions were included in Chapter 143, 2016 Laws ofMaryland (the State’s Budget Bill) to
5

--- Page 7 ---
withhold certain transportation aid for the two aforementioned local governments (Deer Park and
Marydel) until the governments have submitted audit reports for fiscal years 2013. 2014. and
201 5. Additionally, the Budget I3ill also contained a provision that provided that certain money
appropriated for the purpose ofa disparity grant to Baltimore City not be expended until the City
submits its fiscal year 2015 and 201 6 audit reports to the Department of Legislative Services.
For areas of noncompliance with State law pertaining to unsecured cash deposits and for
potential financial problems (for example, deficit fund balances). our Office requests the
applicable local governments to provide written descriptions ofthe actions to be taken to
eliminate the conditions, when appropriate. We then review and evaluate the responses to these
requests. Additionally. as requested by the Committee, when letters were sent to local
governments regarding noncompliance with State laws and potential financial problems, copies
ofthe letters were also sent to the appropriate members ofthe Maryland General Assembly.
CONCLUSION:
In summary, the Office of Legislative Audits functions in an oversight capacity by
issuing audit guidelines, reviewing local government audit reports for compliance with standards
and regulations, and notifying the local governments and their auditors ofany deficiencies noted.
We believe that these efforts have helped improve the quality ofaudits and have promoted fiscal
accountabilily among local governments in Maryland.
To further improve the quality of local government audits, we participate in various
efforts to make technical information available to local governments. For example, we routinely
respond to technical inquiries from local governments and their auditors.
I will be happy to answer any questions you may have on this presentation.
