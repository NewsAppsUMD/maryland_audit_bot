Members of Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee
Annapolis, Maryland
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of Regulatory Services, a budgetary
unit within the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) for the period beginning
September 25, 2019 and ending July 31, 2023. Regulatory Services consists of 22
Health Professional Boards and Commissions (HPBCs) and the Office of Health
Care Quality (OHCQ). The various HPBCs and OHCQ are responsible for
licensing and regulating health professionals (such as physicians, nurses and
pharmacists) and health care facilities in the State. During the audit period, the
HPBCs and OHCQ had significant vacancy rates, which may have contributed, at
least in part, to the findings in this report.
Our audit disclosed that the Board of Nursing could not document that it
investigated and took appropriate action for 259 individuals who may have
obtained a nursing license in Maryland using fraudulent credentials, including at
least 131 who were employed in a Maryland medical facility as of December
2023. We also found that the Board of Nursing and several other HPBCs did not
ensure that complaints against licensees were investigated in a timely manner, a
condition repeated in reports dating back to 2017. As of February 2024, 3,051
(62 percent) of the 4,916 open complaints had been open for more than 2 years,
the majority of which related to the Board of Nursing. These licensees continue
to practice until investigations are completed and any actions deemed necessary
are taken.
Our audit also noted that OHCQ had not performed annual inspections for certain
assisted living facilities, developmental disabilities service providers, and long-
term care facilities, a condition noted in previous reports dating back to 2004.
Our audit also disclosed that several HPBCs did not have adequate controls over
collections, a condition included in previous reports dating back to 2006. In this

--- Page 4 ---
regard, we identified licenses valued at $47,600 for which the applicable HPBC
could not support that the related fees had been received and deposited.
In addition, our audit disclosed that 10 HPBCs did not require criminal
background checks as a condition of licensure and/or obtain subsequent alerts of
criminal activity committed by licensees. While State law governing other
HPBCs required criminal background checks and subsequent alerts, these
provisions are not included in the State laws governing the aforementioned 10
HPBCs. State laws and regulations provide that each HPBC may deny licenses to
applicants who are convicted of, or plead guilty to, crimes of moral turpitude.
Due to the aforementioned condition, the 10 HPBCs were not aware of applicants
and/or licensees that were convicted of, or plead guilty to, crimes of moral
turpitude.
Furthermore, our audit disclosed cybersecurity-related findings. However, in
accordance with the State Government Article, Section 2-1224(i) of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, we have redacted the findings from this audit
report. Specifically, State law requires the Office of Legislative Audits to redact
cybersecurity findings in a manner consistent with auditing best practices before
the report is made available to the public. The term “cybersecurity” is defined in
the State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3.5-301(b), and using our
professional judgment we have determined that the redacted findings fall under
the referenced definition. The specifics of the cybersecurity findings were
previously communicated to those parties responsible for acting on our
recommendations.
MDH’s response to this audit, on behalf of Regulatory Services, is included as an
appendix to this report. Consistent with State law, we have redacted the elements
of MDH’s response related to the cybersecurity audit findings. We reviewed the
response and noted general agreement to our findings and related
recommendations, and while there are other aspects of MDH’s response which
will require further clarification, we do not anticipate that these will require the
Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee’s attention to resolve.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the audit by
Regulatory Services.
Respectfully submitted,
Brian S. Tanen
Brian S. Tannen, CPA, CFE
Legislative Auditor

According to the State’s financial records, during fiscal year 2023, expenditures
totaled approximately $75.5 million, with the majority ($44.8 million) coming
from special funds (see Figure 2). As noted in Figure 2, as of June 30, 2023,
approximately 11 percent of the total 526 positions were vacant. These vacancies
may have contributed, at least in part, to the findings in this report.

Organizational Change
Chapter 254, Laws of Maryland 2023, effective May 3, 2023, created the
Maryland Cannabis Administration (MCA) and transferred the administration and
management of the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC) to MCA.
The activities of MMCC through May 2, 2023 were subject to review during our
current audit.
Ransomware Security Incident
In December 2021, MDH experienced a broad security incident resulting from a
ransomware attack.2 This incident affected the entire MDH computer network
and disrupted information technology operations for all MDH servers and end
user computers, resulting in substantial impact on all MDH business operations,
including Regulatory Services. MDH notified the Department of Information
Technology’s (DoIT) Office of Security Management, which initiated incident
response measures. Various other parties were informed of this incident or
engaged for recovery efforts. DoIT concluded that no evidence existed indicating
that sensitive or regulated information had been improperly acquired.
The incident response measures, and related controls were subject to review as
part of our recent audit of the MDH Office of the Secretary and Other Units. This
incident did not significantly impact our audit, and we were able to obtain
information needed to satisfy our audit objectives and related conclusions.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the seven findings
contained in our preceding audit report dated January 19, 2021. See Figure 3 for
the results of our review.
2 As defined by the federal Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency, ransomware is an ever-evolving form of malware designed to encrypt files on a
device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then
demand ransom in exchange for decryption.

Findings and Recommendations
Investigation of Potentially Fraudulent Nursing Licenses
Finding 1
The Board of Nursing could not document that it investigated and took
appropriate action for 259 individuals who may have obtained a nursing
license in Maryland using fraudulent credentials, including at least 131 who
were employed in a Maryland medical facility as of December 2023.
Analysis
The Board of Nursing could not document that it investigated and took
appropriate action for 259 individuals who may have obtained a nursing license in
Maryland using fraudulent credentials. On January 25, 2023, the United States
Attorney’s Office announced that a joint investigation conducted by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Health and Human Services Office
of Inspector General (DHHS – OIG) had identified a scheme involving fraudulent
nursing degree diplomas and transcripts. These fraudulent credentials were used
by numerous individuals to qualify for the national nursing board exam, enabling
them to obtain licensure in various states.
DHHS – OIG periodically provided the names of individuals suspected of
participating in this scheme to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing4
(NCSBN). Between September 2022 and October 2023, the DHHS – OIG
referred 287 individuals with a Maryland nursing license to NCSBN. We were
advised by the Board of Nursing that it obtained the listing of these individuals
from the NCSBN and investigated the majority of them.
Our review disclosed that the Board of Nursing could not document that it had
investigated 259 of the 287 who still held active Maryland licenses as of February
2024. In this regard, our Data Analytics Unit obtained State wage records from
the Maryland Department of Labor between December 2020 and December 2023.
Using this data we determined that at least 131 of these 259 individuals were
employed by a Maryland medical facility as of December 2023 including six
employed at one State-owned facility.
4 NCSBN is an independent, non-profit organization which serves as a collaborative body for state
boards of nursing, facilitating communication and action on public health and safety matters.
The NCSBN maintains a central repository of the national licensing and disciplinary data.
9

--- Page 12 ---
Recommendation 1
We recommend that the Board of Nursing
a. timely investigate and take appropriate disciplinary action when concerns
are identified with eligibility, including the aforementioned 259 licensees;
b. refer any individuals who were determined to be improperly licensed to
the Office of the Attorney General – Criminal Division and the
Governor’s Chief Counsel; and
c. retain documentation to support its investigations and related
conclusions.
Complaint Investigations
Finding 2
The Health Professional Boards and Commissions (HPBCs) did not ensure
that complaints against licensees were investigated timely. Our review
disclosed that numerous complaints were not investigated within the
required timeframes, including 3,051 open for at least 2 years.
Analysis
The HPBCs did not ensure that investigations of complaints against licensees,5
were completed timely. In accordance with State law, the Maryland Department
of Health (MDH) developed timeframes which ranged from 6 to 18 months for
the HPBCs to complete these investigations and determine whether to bring
charges with the Office of the Attorney General. Timely resolution of complaints
is critical, since licensed individuals are authorized to practice until the
investigation is completed.
Our review of the records of the 20 HPBCs that license healthcare professionals,
disclosed that as of February 2024, 3,594 of the 4,916 open complaints (or
approximately 73 percent) have not been completed timely, including 3,051 (or
62 percent) that had been open for at least 2 years (see Figure 4 on the following
page).6 For example, the Board of Nursing received a complaint in December
2021 related to sexual abuse by a nurse that had not been investigated as of
February 2024.
5 The nature of these complaints included allegations of improper billing, malpractice, and
physical, sexual, and substance abuse.
6 Our review did not include closed complaint investigations, which may have identified additional
untimely complaint investigations.

Source: HPBC records
The HPBCs generally attributed the untimely investigations to staffing shortages
and uncooperative licensees. However, our review of procedures for the Board of
Nursing and the Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists7 disclosed
certain deficiencies in procedures in controls that may have contributed to the
failure to complete the reviews timely. Specifically, neither Board could
document their monitoring of complaint investigations to ensure they were timely.
In addition, the tracking log used by the Board of Nursing did not include all
complaints to enable effective monitoring. For example, our analysis of the 1,181
complaints received by the Board of Nursing between July 2021 and October
2023 that were still open as of January 2024, disclosed that 443 were not recorded
on its tracking log.
Similar conditions regarding insufficient oversight were noted for the Board of
Nursing in our preceding audit report and for the Board of Professional
Counselors and Therapists in two preceding audit reports dating back to April
2017. In their respective responses to our preceding audit report, the Boards
indicated that they would perform supervisory reviews of their complaint tracking
logs to ensure the timely disposition of complaints. The Boards also indicated
that supervisory personnel would ensure that key dates and other critical
information are included in the logs and this would be accomplished by Spring
7 These two HPBCs were selected for review because they accounted for 73 percent of the open
complaints as of February 2024 and deficiencies with their respective oversight of complaint
investigations were noted in our prior Regulatory Services audit report.
11

--- Page 14 ---
2021. However, as noted above, these reviews were not documented and were
not always effective due to incomplete data.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that HPBCs
a. properly monitor complaints (such as by periodically reviewing the
tracking logs) and develop a strategy to ensure the timely disposition of
complaints (repeat), including those noted above; and
b. properly maintain the tracking logs to ensure that the logs reflect all
complaints (repeat).
Inspections
Finding 3
The Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) did not conduct required annual
inspections of certain assisted living facilities, developmental disabilities
service providers, and long-term-care facilities.
Analysis
OHCQ did not conduct required annual inspections of certain assisted living
facilities, developmental disabilities service providers, and long-term-care8
facilities. State law requires OHCQ to conduct inspections at least annually to
ensure compliance with State and federal regulations regarding patient care and
safety. If deficiencies noted during the inspections are not corrected (for example,
failure to maintain client records in accordance with State regulations), OHCQ
may impose sanctions such as license revocation, fines, or other restrictions on the
operating license. Based on OHCQ records, inspections that have been conducted
frequently disclosed deficiencies requiring corrective action.
Our review of OHCQ annual reports disclosed that OHCQ did not complete the
required annual inspections during fiscal years 2020 through 2023. For example,
during fiscal year 2023, OHCQ only inspected 42 of the 255 Long-Term-Care
Facilities (or 19 percent) as shown in Figure 5 on the following page.
8 Long-term-care facility include skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, intermediate
care facility—intellectual disabilities, chronic hospital, tuberculosis hospital, or mental hospital.

Source: OHCQ Annual Reports for Fiscal Years 2020 through 2023
Similar conditions related to OHCQ not completing required inspections have
been commented upon in MDH audit reports dating back to 2004. OHCQ’s
response to our prior report indicated that it would continue to implement the
seven-year staffing plan it initiated in July 2018 to increase the number of OHCQ
inspectors. According to OHCQ’s fiscal year 2023 Annual Report, between fiscal
year 2018 and 2023 OHCQ added 64 positions.9 OHCQ advised that it plans to
continue adding positions in accordance with this plan. We noted that the
additional inspectors have not had a significant impact on OHCQ’s ability to
complete the required number of inspections.
Recommendation 3
We recommend that OHCQ, in conjunction with MDH, ensure inspections of
assisted living facilities, developmental disabilities service providers, and
long-term-care facilities are completed, as required by law (repeat).
9 The seven-year staffing plan provided for OHCQ to add 74 positions by the end of fiscal year
2024. Subsequent to our review, OHCQ reported that it had fully implemented this plan.

Cash Receipts
Background
According to the State’s records, during fiscal year 2023, collections received by
the 22 HPBCs totaled approximately $67.4 million (see Figure 6). These
collections, which primarily related to licensing fees, were received by mail, in
person, by credit card (processed either by HPBC staff or by third-party vendors),
or by a lockbox.

Collections received by mail and in person were deposited using remote deposit, a
process that scans the images of checks and electronically transmits those images
to the bank for deposit. Collections initially received by 17 HPBCs were
forwarded to an HPBC employee who scanned checks into the remote deposit
system. The Board of Nursing, Board of Occupational Therapy Practice, and
Medical Cannabis Commission used their own remote deposit systems.
Finding 4
Controls over collections received and deposited by certain HPBCs were not
adequate, and duties related to cash receipts and licensing were not properly
segregated.
Analysis
Controls over collections received and deposited by certain HPBCs were not
adequate, and duties related to cash receipts and licensing were not properly
segregated. As summarized in Figure 7 on page 17, our review of procedures and
controls at the 22 HPBCs disclosed deficiencies at 7 of the HPBCs:
Credit Card Collections
Our review disclosed that the Board of Nursing, Board of Professional Counselors
and Therapists, and Board of Pharmacy did not have procedures to verify that all
credit card collections processed by third-party vendors were deposited into the
State’s bank account and recorded in the State’s accounting records. According
to State accounting records, these three HPBCs had credit card collections totaling
approximately $13.1 million in fiscal year 2023.
Similar conditions were noted in our two preceding audit reports dating back to
April 2017. The HPBCs’ response to our preceding report indicated that they
would implement procedures to verify credit card collections by February 2021.
The Board of Nursing and Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists
advised us that they implemented a verification process but that the employees
responsible for this function had left employment and the responsibilities were not
reassigned. As of October 2023, the Board of Pharmacy had not implemented a
verification process.
In addition, our review disclosed that the Board of Nursing did not resolve a
$386,000 discrepancy between the collections processed by its credit card vendor
and the amounts recorded in the State’s accounting records that was identified in
our preceding audit report. Although the Board indicated it would work with the
State Treasurer’s Office to resolve the discrepancy, as of October 2023, the Board
could not document any additional efforts to investigate and resolve the
discrepancy.
15

--- Page 18 ---
Segregation of Duties
Five employees who were responsible for processing collections received at four
HPBCs were also assigned licensing system capabilities that allowed them to
issue or renew licenses, certificates, or permits, or adjust the related billing
records. As a result, collections could be misappropriated, and the related
licenses issued without detection. We were advised by HPBC personnel that they
could not properly segregate these duties due to limited resources.
Similar conditions were noted in our two preceding audit reports dating back to
April 2017 for the Board of Dental Examiners and Board for Residential Child
Care Administrators. In response to our preceding report, these HPBCs reported
that they had segregated cash handling and licensing duties. Although the Board
of Dental Examiners advised us that they had segregated these duties, our review
identified two employees with licensing duties that also were responsible for
processing cash receipts. The Board of Residential Child Care Administrators
advised us that it did not segregate these duties due to limited staffing.
Reconciliations of Licenses to Related Collections
Seven HPBCs did not conduct comprehensive reconciliations of licenses to the
related collection to ensure that the value of licenses issued with the related
collections to ensure that all collections were accounted for and deposited.
Specifically, six HPBCs did not conduct any reconciliations and our review of the
Board of Pharmacy’s reconciliation for May 2023 disclosed that the value of
licenses issued ($840,000) exceeded the amount deposited ($794,000) by $46,000
which was not identified and resolved. Our test of 20 licenses10 issued by the
seven HPBCs disclosed that the Board of Dental Examiners and Board of
Professional Counselors and Therapists could not support that approximately
$1,600 in fees associated with four licenses were received and deposited.
The lack of reconciliations of licenses issued to the related collections by certain
HPBCs has been commented upon in our MDH audit reports dating back to 2006.
In response to our preceding report, the HPBCs reported that they would
implement these reconciliations by December 2021. Six HPBCs advised that
reconciliations were not implemented due to a lack of staffing and as noted above,
the Board of Pharmacy’s reconciliations were not properly performed.
10 We arbitrarily selected licenses issued by these seven HPBCs during fiscal year 2022 and 2023.

N/A – Not Applicable - The Board of Pharmacy does not handle cash.
The Comptroller of Maryland’s Accounting Procedures Manual11requires
collections to be independently verified to deposit and recorded in the State’s
accounting records. In addition, the Manual requires the separation of cash
handling duties and licensing duties and reconciling the value of licenses to the
related collections.
Recommendation 4
We recommend that the HPBCs
a. perform documented verifications that credit card collections were
deposited and properly recorded in the State’s accounting records
(repeat);
b. determine whether the aforementioned $386,000 in unrecorded credit
card collections was deposited and properly recorded in the State’s
accounting records (repeat);
c. ensure that employees processing collections are denied the system
capability to issue or renew licenses, certificates, or permits, or to update

related billing records (repeat);
d. periodically reconcile licensing activity with the related collections
(repeat); and
e. investigate and pursue the recovery of fees not collected and deposited,
including those noted above.
Criminal Background Checks
Finding 5 (Policy Issue)
Ten HPBCs did not require criminal background checks when an individual
applied to become a licensed health professional and/or obtain subsequent
alerts of criminal activity. As a result, several active licensees convicted of
crimes of moral turpitude were not identified.
Analysis
Ten HPBCs did not require criminal background checks as a condition of
licensure and/or obtain subsequent alerts of criminal activity conducted by their
licensees. State laws and regulations provide that each Board may deny a license
if the applicant or licensee is convicted of, or pleads guilty to, a crime involving
moral turpitude. Our review of the 20 HPBCs that issue licenses disclosed that 10
did not require criminal background checks and/or obtain subsequent alerts of
criminal activity.
The 10 HPBCs advised us that they were not authorized by State law to require
criminal background checks and/or obtain alerts of subsequent criminal activity.
In this regard, criminal background checks and subsequent alerts were required by
State law for certain HPBCs but were not included in the laws governing the 10
HPBCs. Specifically, State law did not include the criminal background
provision for 6 HPBCs and did not include the subsequent alert provision for 10
of the HPBCs (see Figure 8 on the following page).

Our Data Analytics Unit independently obtained conviction records from the
Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services between
September 2019 and May 2024. We matched this data to licensed Dental and
19

--- Page 22 ---
Pharmacy12 health professionals as of February 2024 and identified 16 licensed
dental professionals and 14 licensed pharmacy professionals who were convicted
of crimes including possession of controlled dangerous substances, assault, and
theft. State regulations provide for disciplinary action ranging from probation to
license revocation based on the severity of the crime. For example, 2 of the
aforementioned licensed dental professionals were convicted of assault, which
should have resulted in these licenses being suspended for at least 1 year.
Recommendation 5
We recommend that the HPBCs consult with legal counsel to pursue the
necessary steps to
a. require criminal background checks for all applicants, and
b. obtain alerts when licensed health professionals are convicted of criminal
activity and take appropriate disciplinary action.
Information Systems Security and Control
We determined that the Information Systems Security and Control section,
including Findings 6 through 9 related to “cybersecurity,” as defined by the State
Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3.5-301(b) of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, and therefore are subject to redaction from the publicly available audit
report in accordance with the State Government Article 2-1224(i). Consequently,
the specifics of the following findings, including the analysis, related
recommendations, along with MDH’s responses, have been redacted from this
report copy.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of Regulatory Services, a budgetary
unit within the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) for the period beginning
September 25, 2019 and ending July 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine Regulatory
Services’ financial transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its
compliance with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included health professional and facilities licensing, cash
receipts, contracts, and information systems security and control. We also
determined the status of the findings contained in our preceding audit report.
Our audit did not include certain support services provided to Regulatory Services
by MDH – Office of the Secretary and Other Units. These support services (such
as payroll, purchasing, maintenance of accounting records, and related fiscal
functions) are included within the scope of our audit of MDH - Office of the
Secretary and Other Units.
Our assessment of internal controls was based on agency procedures and controls
in place at the time of our fieldwork. Our tests of transactions and other auditing
procedures were generally focused on the transactions occurring during our audit
period of September 25, 2019 to July 31, 2023, but may include transactions
before or after this period as we considered necessary to achieve our audit
objectives.
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, tests of transactions,
and to the extent practicable, observations of Regulatory Services’ operations.
Generally, transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgment,
which primarily considers risk, the timing or dollar amount of the transaction, or
the significance of the transaction to the area of operation reviewed. As a matter
22

--- Page 25 ---
of course, we do not normally use sampling in our tests, so unless otherwise
specifically indicated, neither statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was
used to select the transactions tested. Therefore, unless sampling is specifically
indicated in a finding, the results from any tests conducted or disclosed by us
cannot be used to project those results to the entire population from which the test
items were selected.
We also performed various data extracts of pertinent information from the State’s
Financial Management Information System (such as revenue and expenditure
data), the State’s Central Payroll Bureau (payroll data), State wage data from the
Maryland Department of Labor (MDL), and criminal justice information from the
Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). The extracts
are performed as part of ongoing internal processes established by the Office of
Legislative Audits and were subject to various tests to determine data reliability.
We determined that the data extracted from these sources were sufficiently
reliable for the purposes the data were used during this audit.
We also extracted data from various agency systems, including the licensing’s
system at various HPBCs and the inspection system at OHCQ, for the purpose of
testing whether licenses were properly issued and inspections were performed as
required. We performed various tests of the relevant data and determined that the
data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes the data were used during the
audit. Finally, we performed other auditing procedures that we considered
necessary to achieve our audit objectives. The reliability of data used in this
report for background or informational purposes was not assessed.
Regulatory Services’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial
records; effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including safeguarding of
assets; and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
As provided in Government Auditing Standards, there are five components of
internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities,
information and communication, and monitoring. Each of the five components,
when significant to the audit objectives, and as applicable to Regulatory Services,
were considered by us during the course of this audit.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
23

--- Page 26 ---
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes findings relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect Regulatory Services’ ability to maintain reliable financial
records, operate effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws,
rules, and regulations. Our report also includes findings regarding significant
instances of noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
In addition, this report includes a finding which is identified as a “Policy Issue”.
Such findings represent significant operational or financial-related issues for
which formal criteria may not necessarily exist, and for which management has
significant discretion in addressing, but the recommendation represents prudent
and or practical actions, which we believe should be implemented by the agency
to improve outcomes. Other less significant findings were communicated to
Regulatory Services that did not warrant inclusion in this report.
State Government Article Section 2-1224(i) requires that we redact in a manner
consistent with auditing best practices any cybersecurity findings before a report
is made available to the public. This results in the issuance of two different
versions of an audit report that contains cybersecurity findings – a redacted
version for the public and an unredacted version for government officials
responsible for acting on our audit recommendations.
The State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3.5-301(b), states that
cybersecurity is defined as “processes or capabilities wherein systems,
communications, and information are protected and defended against damage,
unauthorized use or modification, and exploitation”. Based on that definition, and
in our professional judgment, we concluded that certain findings in this report fall
under that definition. Consequently, for the publicly available audit report all
specifics as to the nature of cybersecurity findings and required corrective actions
have been redacted. We have determined that such aforementioned practices, and
government auditing standards, support the redaction of this information from the
public audit report. The specifics of these cybersecurity findings have been
communicated to Regulatory Services and those parties responsible for acting on
our recommendations in an unredacted audit report.
The responses from MDH, on behalf of Regulatory Services, to our findings and
recommendation is included as an appendix to this report. Depending on the
24

--- Page 27 ---
version of the audit report, responses to any cybersecurity findings may be
redacted in accordance with State law. As prescribed in the State Government
Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we will advise MDH
regarding the results of our review of its response.

Investigation of Potentially Fraudulent Nursing Licenses
Finding 1
The Board of Nursing could not document that it investigated and took
appropriate action for 259 individuals who may have obtained a nursing
license in Maryland using fraudulent credentials, including at least 131 who
were actively working in a Maryland medical facility as of December 2023.
We recommend that the Board of Nursing
a. timely investigate and take appropriate disciplinary action when concerns
are identified with eligibility, including the aforementioned 259 licensees;
b. refer any individuals who were determined to be improperly licensed to
the Office of the Attorney General – Criminal Division and the
Governor’s Chief Counsel; and
c. retain documentation to support its investigations and related
conclusions.

corrective action or Board of Nursing has located a substantial amount of the records
explain disagreement. documenting the work conducted to screen and process the 259
individuals who may have obtained licensure in Maryland using
fraudulent credentials. We continue to search for the remaining records.
Between September of 2022 and October of 2023, the Maryland Board
of Nursing conducted a preliminary investigation and:
● Processed 205 of the 259 individuals on the list provided by the
FBI and compiled by the National Council for State Boards of
Nursing (NCSBN) in NURSYS, the national database managed
by NCSBN, that verifies the licensure and discipline of nurses .
● Determined that Maryland has no cause to take disciplinary
action against 205 of the individuals because the Maryland LPN
or RN license was obtained with legitimate credentials, or, the
Maryland Board of Nursing does not have jurisdiction because
the individual does not have a Maryland RN or LPN license, a
pending RN or LPN application, or a privilege to practice nursing
in Maryland pursuant to a multistate RN or LPN license.
● Initiated full investigations of the remaining 54 individuals
between September of 2022 and October of 2023Of these, 12
cases were closed after the applicant withdrew the application for
RN licensure (withdrawals occurred between February 2024 and
February 2025), 3 were closed by voluntary surrender of the RN
license, and 3 were closed by revocation of the privilege to
practice in Maryland. The Board has voted to issue charges in 7
of the cases and those cases have been transferred to the Office
of the Attorney General for prosecution. Three cases were
disposed of by a vote of take no action by the Board for the
following reasons: (1) the individual graduated with legitimate
credentials in 2024, (2) the individual did not file an application
for a Maryland license, and (3) the individual withdrew the
application for the Maryland RN license. The remaining 26 cases
continue to be actively investigated. Board of Nursing
anticipates these remaining 26 investigations to be complete
by 7/31/2025.

Complaint Investigations
Finding 2
The Health Professional Boards and Commissions (HPBCs) did not ensure
that complaints against licensees were investigated timely. Our review
disclosed that numerous complaints were not investigated within the
required timeframes, including 3,051 open for at least 2 years.
We recommend that HPBCs
a. properly monitor complaints (such as by periodically reviewing the
tracking logs) and develop a strategy to ensure the timely disposition of
complaints (repeat), including those noted above; and
b. properly maintain the tracking logs to ensure that the logs reflect all
complaints (repeat).
Agency Response
Analysis Factually Accurate
Please provide The Board of Nursing (Board) has developed and implemented a
additional comments as strategy focused on the timely disposition of complaints. There are
deemed necessary. currently 6 vacant investigator positions. Filling these vacancies and
training the new investigators will aid the Board in disposing of cases;
however, in order to ensure that complaints are investigated timely
(within the established timeframe), the Board would require more
investigative personnel than what it is currently allotted to handle the
workload effectively.
Recommendation 2a Agree Estimated Completion Date: See below
Board of Nursing Response: While many of the Board of Nursing
investigations are completed timely, particularly those that are triaged as
high priority cases, the Board acknowledges that some investigations are
not completed within the target timeframe of 540 days in accordance
with Managing for Results goal objective 2.1. Historically, the Board has
struggled with a lack of resources to manage the caseload of complaints
received. The lack of resources, including limited investigations staff,
contributed to the backlog of complaints identified by the Board in June
of 2019. Both MDH and the Board have taken substantial steps towards
eliminating the backlog of cases. Based on findings and
recommendations documented in the independent evaluation of the
Board conducted in accordance with Senate Bill 960/House Bill 611 of
2023, MDH allocated 10 non-nurse investigator positions to assist with
clearing the backlog. The Board has prioritized efforts to reduce the
Page 4 of 20

--- Page 36 ---
Maryland Department of Health
Regulatory Services
Agency Response Form
number of outstanding investigations, including by hiring additional
investigative staff. Currently, 5 of the 10 contractual non-nurse
investigator positions have been filled. The Board is actively recruiting
for 5 contractual non-nurse investigator positions and 1 contractual nurse
investigation position. The Board worked with MDH and reclassified the
non-nurse investigator position to align with the requirements of the
position. The Board is actively recruiting for the 5 vacant non-nurse
investigator positions under the new classification. The Board is
currently allocated 18 investigator positions including the 10 non-nurse
investigator positions; however, to investigate all open cases within the
established timeframe and clear any existing backlog would require an
estimated 34 additional investigators. The Board currently has a total of
1303 open cases. 796 of these cases have been open for more than 540
days. Both case load and complexity of cases contribute to prolonged
investigation timeframes.
Based on the results of the NCSBN Discipline Efficiency Study, the
Board estimates that reducing each investigator’s caseload to a
maximum of 25 cases per investigator would assist with clearing the
backlog and allow cases to be investigated timely. However, the Board
will need more investigative resources to achieve this goal.
The Board focuses its existing resources on investigating complaints that
pose a potential risk to the public. The Board utilizes the National
Council for State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) guidelines for assigning
case priority/risk level. Risk levels range from priority 1 to priority 3
with priority 1 being high risk and high harm violations and priority 3
being low risk/low harm violations. In January of 2024, the Board voted
to administratively close cold cases that were 2019 and older. Before
presenting them to the Board for administrative closure, investigative
staff evaluated each case using the NCSBN priority/risk guidelines. In
January of 2024, the complaint triage process was formally delegated by
the Board to the Executive Director with specific instructions on how to
review and prioritize incoming complaints using the NCSBN
prioritization guidelines. The complaints unit now reviews and triages
incoming complaints daily to screen for priority cases and the Chief
Nurse Investigator immediately assigns priority 1 complaints to an
investigator. This process has decreased the amount of days for priority
1 complaints from receipt to triage from 50 days or greater to less than
24 business hours.
The Board estimates that the 6 vacant investigator positions will be
filled and the individuals trained by 12/31/2025.

staff to ensure properly monitoring the timely disposition of complaints.
Complete
Board of Social Work Examiners (BSWE) Response: Staffing has
been the number one issue in investing and resolving complaints. For FY
2025, BSWE added two full time Health Occupation Investigator III
Merit PINs. One of these PINs is filled and the other is in the active
recruitment stage. In August 2024, BSWE was faced with another
vacancy in the Compliance Unit that was recently filled. As of Feb 9,
2025, BSWE has two full time Health Occupation Investigators with one
open PIN in active recruitment. Once the third Health Investigator PIN is
hired, BSWE will have a fully staffed compliance unit with a Director,
Administrator I and three Health Occupation Investigators. With staffing
issues addressed, BSWE anticipates that the backlog of complaints will
be eliminated, and future complaints will be handled within required
time frames.
The Board of Social Work has developed a strategy to address the time
disposition of complaints which includes the hiring of two additional
Health Occupation Investigators. One position is still in active
recruitment; therefore, we anticipate to have someone hired and
onboarded by the end of April. Estimated Completion Date: April 30,
2025.
Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners (MSBDE) Response: An
extensive spreadsheet has been created after identifying and categorizing
all cases within the database. Tracking logs and various reports are now
used to monitor, track and timely address cases that are submitted to the
unit. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and workflows have been
written to ensure that the proper processes are being followed. The
Dental Board will need to be given the same timeframe as the other large
Boards (540 days) to investigate and close cases. The current timeframe
is inadequate due to the complexity of the cases. Estimated Completion
Date: December 31, 2025.
Board of Pharmacy Response: Complaints are currently tracked by
spreadsheet that will make a case turn “red” if it hits the 180 day mark
indicating to supervisors and investigators that the complaint is nearly
due for completion. Employees also have weekly meetings to discuss
current cases and current case statuses. Complete

We anticipate being in compliance with annual inspections for ALFs by
November 2025.
For developmental disability (DD) service providers, we are in
compliance and on track to complete Initial or Relicensure surveys for
all licensed DD providers serving individuals for FY25.
The Long-Term Care (LTC) unit has implemented a comprehensive
three-part strategy to address the backlog and improve annual survey
completion rates:
1. Increased Staffing: OHCQ has significantly expanded its LTC
unit (merit position). In FY24, we filled five Health Facilities
Nurse Surveyor positions, and in FY25, we received 13
additional merit positions allocated to the LTC unit—12 for
Nurse Surveyors and one for a Long-Term Care Unit
Coordinator. All positions have been filled.
2. Contracting External Support: To further address the backlog,
OHCQ secured a $5.6 million contract with two external
agencies to provide SMQT-certified Health Facilities Surveyor
Nurses, ensuring additional support in conducting surveys.
3. Enhanced Training and Efficiency Measures: OHCQ has
developed and implemented targeted training programs aimed at
improving surveyor efficiency. These initiatives focus on

reducing orientation time and expediting survey completion
while maintaining quality and compliance standards.
As a result of these efforts, our annual full survey completion rate has
increased by 160% in FY25. Based on our current progress and strategic
initiatives, we anticipate achieving full compliance for long-term care
facilities by 10/30/2026.

2025 Board staff recently received information: (fingerprint cards,
privacy rights forms, applicant notification form, Live Scan form) from
CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Systems) to begin the process for
requesting Criminal History Records Check. Fingerprint cards have been
mailed to out-of-state licensees/applicants, as well as the Live Scan form
has been mailed to in-state licensees/applicants. The application requires
applicants to complete character and fitness questions on their
application. In addition, licensees are required to inform the Board of
any criminal activities they are involved in, and complete a self query
through the National Practitioner Data Bank. Board staff is currently
waiting to receive the results of the Background Checks from those
licensees who were required to complete a background check as of
October 1, 2025, expected completion by December 1, 2025.
Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners (MSBDE) Response:
The Board currently does not have regulations that require a criminal
background check. The Board uses character and fitness attestation
questions on both the initial and renewal applications to uncover
criminal activity. Alerts are received from the National Practitioners
Data Bank as they are received.
Board of Pharmacy Response: Board of Pharmacy does not have
statutory authority to run criminal background checks on all license
applications.
The Board of Pharmacy is currently required to conduct criminal
background checks on Pharmacy Technicians only through our
legislation. Any criminal background information about a technician is
presented to the board to approve or deny the application. Since our
regulations do not require us to do criminal background checks on all
licensees, we can not conduct them.
Board of Dietetic Practice Response: The Board does not have the
authority for criminal background checks. Applicants and licensees self
report criminal background on initial and renewal applications.
However, the Board will study the issue and will determine whether to
submit future legislation. The Board will discuss this issue at the next
Board meeting. If they approve it, it will be submitted for legislation
during the next legislative session. The earliest implication would
probably be in 2027.
Board of Environmental Health Response: The (BEHS) has been

Board of Examiners of Psychologists Response: In 2019, the Board of
Psychologists began requiring background checks of its licensees every
six (6) years by the passing of HB912 in 2019 because CJIS did not
include the health boards in the Rap Back program. To date, the program
is still not operational for the health boards. When CJIS implements this
program to the Board, the Board will submit legislation to replace the
requirement for every six years with the Rap Back program. In addition,
licensees are required to inform the Board of any criminal activities they
are involved in, and the Board uses the National Practitioner Data Bank
to report incidents and check for incidents of licensees.
The Board of Physical Therapy Examiners (MBPHTE) Response:
MBPHTE receives notifications regarding licensed physical therapy
practitioners who have been convicted of criminal offenses from the
FSBPT and NPDB. The license renewal application requires applicants
to respond to character and fitness questions pertaining to investigations
and convictions within this jurisdiction, as well as in any other state or
foreign country, encompassing both felonies and misdemeanors.
MBPHTE is actively engaged in the exploration of supplementary alert
systems. Should viable additional supplementary alert systems be
identified, the Board of Directors will confer with Board Counsel to
evaluate the potential for adoption and determine whether legislative
action is warranted. Estimated Completion Date: December 31, 2025.
The Board of Podiatric Medical Examiners (“Board”) Response:
STATUTE§16–302.1 provides the authority for mandatory requirement
to require a background Check CJIS result before each issuance of a
license. The Board may deny a license if the applicant or licensee is
convicted of or pleads guilty to a crime involving moral turpitude, or
other issues related to unacceptable Background Check results.
In the past 7 years since the General Assembly passed legislation for the
Board to obtain the CJIS Reports before license issuance, the Board
submitted several types of via States’ Licensure Affidavits, NPDB
search, and self-reporting at the time of license issuance and renewals,
which would have also included and identified criminal actions,
outcomes and penalties for such. Subsequently, there was no adverse
impact on any license issuance.
Nevertheless, the Board appreciates and accepts the OLA
recommendation to obtain alerts via the Rap Back option, when licensed

podiatrists are convicted of criminal activity and to take appropriate
disciplinary action. Subsequently, the Board voted unanimously, at
theirFebruary 13, 2025, Public Meeting, to propose legislation to add the
opportunity for Rap Back alerts addressing convictions of criminal
activity, and the maintaining of this process throughout the ownership of
the professional license.
Board of Optometry Response: The Board of Optometry will request
background checks to be completed as soon as all information is
received from the Criminal Justice Information Systems. Estimated
Completion Date: December 1, 2025.
Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners (MSBDE) Response:
The Board utilizes character and fitness questions on both the initial and
renewal applications. If there are any yes answers to these questions, the
Board will then investigate the incident that has been reported by the
applicant. The Board receives alerts from the National Practitioners Data
Bank when activity is reported. This information is used to assist with
the investigation.
Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors Response:
Currently, the Board does not receive automatic alerts when licensed
health professionals are convicted of crimes post-licensure. To address
this gap: Collaboration with CJIS will be necessary to establish a process
for obtaining timely alerts regarding criminal activity involving licensed
professionals. The Board will evaluate such alerts under its existing
disciplinary framework, considering factors such as the severity of the
offense and potential risks to public safety. Any disciplinary action will
align with the Board’s statutory authority and due process requirements.
The Board remains committed to upholding high professional and ethical
standards while ensuring compliance with state regulations. We look
forward to working with OLA and CJIS to enhance our oversight
mechanisms and protect public welfare.
Board of Pharmacy Response: Board of Pharmacy currently does not
have the authority to additionally request alerts on licensees that have a
criminal history.
Board of Dietetic Practice Response: Board will study the issue and
will determine whether to submit future legislation. The Board will
discuss this issue at the next Board meeting. If they approve it, it will be
