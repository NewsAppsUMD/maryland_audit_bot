Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with the provisions of the Education Article, Section 16-315(h) of
the Annotated Code of Maryland, we have reviewed the audit reports that must be
filed by 15 of the State’s community colleges with the Maryland Higher
Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.
Our review disclosed that the community colleges and their independent auditors
substantially complied with the applicable statutes and the guidelines promulgated
by MHEC. Specifically, our review disclosed that all opinions expressed by the
colleges’ independent auditors stated that the applicable financial statements were
fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Furthermore, we noted six colleges had deficit
balances in unrestricted net position as of June 30, 2020.
Additionally, for one college, the independent auditor reported two material
weaknesses related to certain compliance requirements for fiscal year 2020. In
this instance, MHEC evaluated the adequacy of the college’s response to the
material weaknesses and concluded that appropriate corrective actions were
indicated, and stated that it would continue to monitor corrective actions taken by
the college.

A draft copy of this report was provided to MHEC for review and comment.
Since there are no recommendations in this report, a written response was not
necessary.
Respectfully submitted,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Purpose of Review and Background Information
In accordance with the provisions of the Education Article, Section 16-315(h) of
the Annotated Code of Maryland, we have reviewed the audit reports that must be
filed by 15 of the State’s community colleges with the Maryland Higher
Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We
reviewed these audit reports to determine compliance with the applicable statutes
and the guidelines promulgated by MHEC. We also reviewed the reports to
determine if any of the community colleges had deficit balances in unrestricted
net position, or uninsured/uncollateralized bank deposits. This report contains the
results of that review.
According to the State’s records, State aid totaling approximately $335.4 million
was granted to 15 of Maryland’s 16 community colleges for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2020. This aid primarily consisted of funding based on cost and student
enrollment data. In addition, it included certain retirement benefits and various
other grants. The remaining college (Baltimore City Community College) is a
budgetary unit of the State and receives an annual State appropriation. Baltimore
City Community College is not subject to the Education Article, Section 16-
315(h) of the Annotated Code of Maryland; however, it obtains annual financial
statement audits that are conducted by a certified public accounting firm. The
College is also subject to fiscal compliance audits by the Office of Legislative
Audits for which separate audit reports are issued.
The Education Article, Section 16-315(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires MHEC to adopt guidelines for the preparation of annual audit reports on
the colleges. The guidelines promulgated by MHEC as State regulations require
independent auditors to express opinions as to the fairness of presentation of the
colleges’ financial statements as well as of the cost and student enrollment data
used for calculating the State aid to the colleges. The guidelines also require the
auditors to issue management letters containing all material weaknesses in the
colleges’ systems of internal controls. While not required, many of the auditors
issue management letters that contain additional recommendations that were not
considered material weaknesses.

Results of Review
Audit Reports
Fourteen of the 15 audit reports for fiscal year 2020 were filed timely.
Our review disclosed that 14 of the 15 community college audit reports were filed
timely with the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2020. The one community college that submitted the audit
report after the required filing date was Cecil College, which filed later than the
date required by law and no extension was requested.
The State’s community colleges are required by law to file annual audit reports
within 90 days of the fiscal year end (June 30) unless an extension is granted.
All audit reports expressed unqualified opinions and were presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Our review disclosed that all 15 community college audit reports for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2020 contained unqualified opinions from their independent
auditors and were presented in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.
MHEC’s audit guidelines require the auditors to express opinions as to the
fairness of the presentation of the colleges’ financial statements and that the audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. An
unqualified opinion is issued when the auditor states that the applicable financial
statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Six community colleges’ financial statements disclosed deficit balances in the
unrestricted portion of their net position at June 30, 2020.
Our review disclosed six colleges with deficit balances in the unrestricted
component of their net position as of June 30, 2020.

Colleges with Deficit Unrestricted Balances as of June 30, 2020
Unrestricted Net Position
College
Deficit
Anne Arundel Community College $54,333,485
Community College of Baltimore County $104,373,979
Carroll Community College $13,424,638
Howard Community College $4,721,004
Montgomery College $37,659,598
Prince George’s Community College $42,114,930
This situation was also noted in the financial statements for Anne Arundel
Community College, Community College of Baltimore County, and Carroll
Community College for each fiscal year since 2011, 2016, and 2009, respectively.
Howard Community College, Montgomery College, and Prince George’s
Community College have each had a deficit unrestricted balance since fiscal year
2018. An unrestricted net position deficit balance represents the cost of current or
past services that will need to be financed in the future periods and could indicate
a potential financial problem.
We did not perform a detailed analysis to determine the cause of these deficits;
nevertheless, the colleges’ financial statements and accompanying notes
contained certain pertinent information relative to the deficits. Specifically, our
review of the colleges’ financial statements disclosed that the unrestricted net
position could be attributed at least in part to other postemployment benefit
liabilities, which at June 30, 2020 totaled $66.5 million for Anne Arundel
Community College; $162.1 million for the Community College of Baltimore
County; $24.0 million for Carroll Community College; $39.2 million for Howard
Community College; $113.2 million for Montgomery College; and $13.2 million
for Prince George’s Community College.
Generally accepted accounting principles specify that liabilities for
postemployment benefits (such as healthcare benefits), which are deferred until
retirement or another future event, be recognized in the years in which the
5

employee provides services rather than during the postemployment period when
payments are made.
Management Letters and Compliance
Management letters for fiscal year 2020 included a total of 10
recommendations for improvement related to 6 colleges’ compliance with
requirements. Two of these recommendations were considered material
weaknesses.
We reviewed the management letters applicable to the audits of the community
colleges that were filed with MHEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Our
review disclosed that 9 of the community colleges did not receive any
recommendations; the remaining 6 community colleges received a total of 10
recommendations. Two of these recommendations were considered material
weaknesses. The material weaknesses existed at Harford Community College and
were related to accounting and financial reporting and financial aid. Specifically,
the College did not properly capitalize prior year amounts related to the Fallston
Hall renovation project and also the College reimbursed itself for costs related to
refunds made to certain students that were not supported by payments to the
student.
As required by the Education Article, Section 16-315(c) of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, MHEC evaluated the adequacy of the College’s response to the
material weaknesses, determined that appropriate corrective action was indicated,
and stated that it would continue to monitor corrective actions taken by the
College.
MHEC was not required to formally evaluate the adequacy of the colleges’
responses to the 8 other recommendations since, in accordance with MHEC’s
guidelines, comments and suggestions related to these non-material deficiencies
are not required. When the independent auditors include such items in the letters,
the colleges’ follow-up actions are subject to the auditors’ review during
subsequent audits.
The following schedule provides a summary of the fiscal year 2020
recommendations by fiscal area. One of the 10 recommendations was repeated
from the preceding year.
