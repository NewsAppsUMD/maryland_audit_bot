Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have audited the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (Fund) for
the period beginning July 1, 2009 and ending June 30, 2010. The Fund was
established to preserve productive agricultural land and is primarily funded by
State and agricultural transfer taxes and local subdivision matching funds. The
Fund is administered by the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation
(MALPF).
Our audit disclosed that certain aspects of MALPF’s database of easement
acquisitions had not been tested for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s
accounting records. In addition, MALPF needs to improve existing procedures to
ensure the propriety of taxes remitted by the counties.
The Department of Agriculture’s response to this audit, on behalf of MALPF, is
included as an appendix to this report. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation
extended to us by MALPF during the course of this audit.
Respectfully submitted,
Bruce A. Myers, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) was
established to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland in Maryland.
MALPF, which is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of 13 members,
purchases land easements with Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund
(Fund) revenue and places certain restrictions on the use of the land (for example,
the land cannot be subdivided for residential or commercial purposes). The Fund,
which is administered by MALPF, generally derives revenues from State transfer
taxes, agricultural transfer taxes, local subdivision matching funds, State bond
proceeds, and federal grants. According to MALPF’s records, since inception
through June 30, 2010, it had purchased 2,076 easements on 284,000 acres of land
for a total cost of approximately $599 million.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the three findings contained
in our preceding audit report dated March 31, 2010. We determined that MALPF
satisfactorily addressed two of these findings. The remaining finding is repeated
in this report.
Financial Information
Attached, as Exhibit A, is a schedule of the financial activity of the Fund for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. This schedule is not intended to, and does not
provide the financial position and results of operations in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Specifically, certain financial
statements (for example, a balance sheet) and disclosures have not been provided
as would be required by generally accepted accounting principles. The schedule
was prepared on a modified accrual basis of accounting which provides that
revenues are recognized when they become available and measurable, and
expenditures are recognized when the related liability is incurred.
MALPF's special fund appropriation for fiscal year 2010 was reduced by
$10,000,000 pursuant to the Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2010.
General Obligation bonds in the amount of $17,814,000 replaced these funds.
This activity is reflected in Exhibit A as “Other Sources (Uses) of Financial
Resources”.

The fund balance as of June 30, 2010 in the Special Revenue Fund ($16,480,162)
represents funds available to finance future expenditures, including easement
acquisitions. The Special Revenue Fund Balance is reserved for easement
acquisitions that were approved by MALPF’s Board of Trustees, but were not
presented to the landowners as well as offers accepted by the landowners that
were awaiting Board of Public Works approval or settlement at year end. The
fund balance as of June 30, 2010 in the Trust Fund ($10,188,154) represents funds
committed for the payment of easements purchased by MALPF on an installment
basis.

Findings and Recommendations
Easement Acquisitions
Finding 1
Certain aspects of the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation
Foundation’s (MALPF) database of easement acquisitions had not been
tested for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s accounting records.
Analysis
Certain aspects of the database of easement acquisitions developed by MALPF
had not been tested for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s accounting records.
MALPF’s database of easements purchased contains information such as the
number of acres purchased and the related purchase price. However, as of
February 23, 2011, the financial data related to easement acquisition costs in the
database had not been tested for accuracy. In addition, the database had not been
reconciled to the State’s accounting records. MALPF management advised us
that it was working on completing the reliability testing of the financial data;
however, it could not provide a definitive date for its completion. Consequently,
there is a lack of assurance that all easement costs were properly accounted for
and reported.
During our review, we also noted a lack of reliable data supporting the total
cumulative cost of easement acquisitions reported in the MALPF Annual Report
to the General Assembly ($599 million) which exceeded the comparable amount
recorded on the State’s accounting records ($548 million) by $51 million.
Additionally, the cumulative cost of the easement acquisitions recorded in the
database totaled approximately $565 million. Similar conditions were
commented upon in our preceding audit report.
We additionally noted that not all of MALPF’s easement acquisitions had been
properly capitalized in the State’s accounting records. Specifically, eight
easements acquired during fiscal year 2010, totaling approximately $5 million had
not been included in the State Comptroller’s records of MALPF’s fixed assets.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MALPF
a. ensure the accuracy of the financial information included in the database
of easement acquisitions (repeat),
b. ensure that easement information is accurately reported in its annual
report and periodically reconciled to the related State accounting records
(repeat), and
6

--- Page 9 ---
c. investigate the aforementioned discrepancies and take appropriate
corrective action (repeat).
County Agricultural Land Transfer Taxes
Background
State law generally requires that county agricultural land preservation programs
remit fifty percent of the agricultural land transfer taxes collected to the Maryland
Comptroller for deposit in the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund.
The remaining transfer tax is to be used by the counties for land preservation and
any transfer taxes not expended or committed on or before three years from the
original date of receipt, shall be remitted to the State for deposit into the Fund.
According to the State’s accounting records, agricultural land transfer taxes
remitted to the State during fiscal year 2010 totaled approximately $1.8 million.
Finding 2
MALPF did not ensure that all counties properly filed an annual report or
remitted unused agricultural land transfer taxes to the State as required.
Analysis
MALPF did not ensure that all counties properly filed an annual report or remitted
unused agricultural land transfer taxes to the State as required. All counties are
required by MALPF policy to submit annual reports that are to include
information regarding the transfer taxes collected by the counties, the nature of
the counties’ use of the taxes, and whether any unexpended taxes were due to the
State.
Our test of 10 counties’ filings disclosed that as of January 10, 2011, MALPF had
not received fiscal year 2010 annual reports from 3 of the counties (generally due
in October 2010) and, as a result, had not ensured the proper disposition of the
transfer taxes. Through subsequent correspondence with one of these three
counties, we identified approximately $19,000 in unexpended funds from fiscal
year 2007 that could potentially be due the State. Our review also disclosed that
MALPF did not have an adequate procedure to establish an accounts receivable
record when funds were due from a county. In this regard, we were advised that
MALPF would call the county requesting the funds rather than have the
Department of Agriculture – Accounting Department establish an accounts
receivable record.
7

--- Page 10 ---
Recommendation 2
We recommend that MALPF establish procedures
a. to obtain and review the required annual reports and monitor the
remission of amounts due to the State, and
b. to maintain accounts receivable records for funds due the State.
Finding 3
MALPF had not established procedures to ensure that the State’s portion of
taxes remitted by the counties on a monthly basis was supported by the
monthly reports.
Analysis
MALPF had not established procedures to ensure that the State’s portion of
agricultural land transfer taxes remitted on a monthly basis by the counties was
supported by the monthly reports. In addition, MALPF did not maintain the
monthly reports from the counties. Agricultural transfer taxes are collected by
each county. The counties remit the State's portion of the taxes collected to the
Comptroller’s Revenue Administration Division (RAD) along with the
corresponding monthly report of collections. Upon receipt, RAD forwards the
reports to MALPF and transfers the related funds via journal entry to the Fund.
Our test of a fiscal year 2010 monthly report for each of 10 different counties with
agricultural transfer taxes collected totaling $117,342, disclosed that, due to errors
in the reports, 2 counties submitted insufficient amounts, totaling $1,320, for the
month reviewed.
Recommendation 3
We recommend that MALPF
a. establish procedures to ensure the agricultural land transfer tax revenue
remitted by the counties is supported by the monthly reports,
b. take the appropriate follow-up action to recover the aforementioned
underpayments by the counties, and
c. retain the related monthly reports for future reference.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have audited the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (Fund) for
the fiscal ending June 30, 2010. The audit was conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine the Fund’s
financial transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance
with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations. We audit the Fund annually as
required by the Agriculture Article, Section 2-505 of the Code. We also
determined the status of the findings contained in our preceding audit report.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of materiality and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included disbursements for the purchase of easements, as
well as receipt of agricultural land transfer taxes, and compliance with easement
terms. Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel,
inspections of documents and records, and observations of the Fund’s operations.
We also tested transactions and performed other auditing procedures that we
considered necessary to achieve our objectives. Data provided in this report for
background or informational purposes were deemed reasonable, but were not
independently verified.
Our audit did not include certain support services provided to the Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) by the Department of
Agriculture. These support services (such as purchasing, data processing,
maintenance of accounting records, and related fiscal functions) are included
within the scope of our audit of the Department.
MALPF management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
9

--- Page 12 ---
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes findings relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. Our report also includes a finding regarding a significant instance of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Other less significant
findings were communicated to the Fund that did not warrant inclusion in this
report.
The Department of Agriculture’s response, on behalf of MALPF, to our findings
and recommendations is included as an appendix to this report. As prescribed in
the State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, we will advise the Department regarding the results of our review of its
response.

Responses to Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation
Audit ending June 30, 2010
Finding 1
Certain aspects of the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation’s (MALPF)
database of easement acquisitions had not been tested for reliability nor reconciled to the
State’s accounting records.
The agency concurs. With the assistance of a University of Maryland intern, MALPF has
completed populating its database of easement acquisitions. We now have the ability to query the
number of easement acres by year, as well as the amounts of all purchases. The database is now
capable of showing any changes in acres and offer amounts from the time an offer is made, to
settlement of the easement. As a consequence of this progress, MALPF will now be able to
reconcile its Annual Report acres, and dollars spent, to the database.
MALPF now needs to embark upon the testing phase of the database process to ensure that the
responses to queries are both accurate and reliable. Tests will be performed to ascertain the
reliability of the database environment. It is anticipated that the database will be tested by July
31, 2011.
The eight easements noted by the auditors have been added to the Fixed Asset Sub-System.
Finding 2
MALPF did not ensure that all counties properly filed an annual report or remitted unused
agricultural land transfer taxes to the State as required.
The agency concurs. The agency will address this issue by transferring the responsibility of
identifying unexpended transfer taxes to the agency’s Fiscal Services program. Initially, a review
will have to be undertaken to ascertain if the agency is in possession of adequate transfer tax
report information from each of the 23 jurisdictions. An analysis of this information will then
ensue to determine if a county is improperly retaining unexpended transfer taxes that should be
remitted to the State. If a jurisdiction is found to be improperly retaining unexpended transfer tax
funds, Fiscal will generate an invoice to bill the county for the amount owed and pursue
collection. In addition, letters will go out to the counties by May 15, 2011 requesting information
regarding any agricultural land taxes retained by the jurisdictions for more than three years.

Responses to Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation
Audit ending June 30, 2010
Finding 3
MALPF had not established procedures to ensure that the State’s portion of taxes remitted
by the counties on a monthly basis was supported by the monthly reports.
The agency concurs. The Tax Property Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland mandates that
county agricultural land preservation programs remit two-thirds of the agricultural land transfer
taxes collected to the Comptroller if the county is not certified and 25% of the agricultural land
transfer taxes collected to the Comptroller if the county is certified. Certification of county
agricultural land preservation programs is regulated by Title 5, Subtitle 4, of the Code of the
Public Laws of Maryland, State Finance and Procurement Article. The receipt of monthly reports
from the Revenue Administration Division (RAD) of the Comptroller reflecting remittances by
the counties of agricultural land transfer taxes has been inconsistent. MALPF will contact RAD
and request that these monthly reports be sent to an identified MALPF employee. Once received,
MALPF will compare these reports to the revenue transfer entries processed by RAD, in light of
each county’s certified or non-certified status, to ascertain if the appropriate amount of revenue
was transferred to the agency. Discrepancies will be brought to the attention of RAD. MALPF
will request the auditor’s information to pursue recovery of the aforementioned underpayments
by the counties.
