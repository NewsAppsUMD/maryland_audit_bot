Reports Recommended for Committee Action
September 1, 2024 to November 30, 2024
The following audit reports have been recommended for follow-up action by the Joint
Audit and Evaluation Committee (JAEC). The basis of the recommendation could
include the number and significance of the audit findings, the agency receiving an
“unsatisfactory” rating (which will necessitate future OLA follow-up), and/or contentious
or controversial issues that remain unresolved or have related recommendations in a
state of implementation (that is, are “in–progress” by the agency). The determination of
whether to recommend a JAEC follow-up letter (letter of concern) or hearing, is based
on a subjective determination by OLA using professional judgment. The purpose of a
“follow-up letter” from the Committee is to convey the Legislature’s formal concern and
reinforce the Committee’s commitment to ensure appropriate accountability is
established (via the audit recommendations) for those audits or findings that do not rise
to the level of a hearing.
1) Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services – Central Operations
(9/17/24 – 4 findings)
2) Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services – Incarcerated
Individual Healthcare Contracts (11/25/24 – 9 findings)

Reports Recommended for Committee Action
September 1, 2024 to November 30, 2024
3) Maryland Public Broadcasting Commission (MPBC) (10/24/24 – 6 findings)
This audit report contained significant findings in several areas of MPBC’s
operations including two findings related to its affiliated foundations. Certain of
these concerns were noted in our prior report and in a subsequent letter of concern
from this Committee.
• MPBC would not provide documentation that it took corrective actions to address
concerns and implemented best practices for its affiliated foundation. Our
preceding audit report noted several concerns with MPBC’s relationship with its
affiliated foundation. In its June 17, 2020 response to the preceding report and
its December 3, 2020 response to a subsequent letter of concern by the JAEC,
MPBC indicated that it conducted a review of the affiliated foundation’s policies,
and was working with the foundation and its external auditors to develop best
practices for its revenue generating activities. MPBC also committed to
continuously monitor the revenue generating activity.
During our current audit, MPBC would not provide us with any documentation of
the aforementioned review and ongoing monitoring activities. Accordingly, we
could not determine if MPBC took the actions described in its response to the
JAEC and was adequately monitoring the foundation.
• MPBC could not justify the diversion of approximately $1.3 million in State
revenue to the affiliated foundation during fiscal years 2020 through 2023.
MPBC directed State agencies to pay its affiliated foundation for production
services provided by MPBC. According to State records, 15 State agencies paid
the affiliated foundation approximately $900,000 during fiscal years 2020 through
2023. Our review of $370,000 paid by one State agency disclosed this
represented 12 underwriting agreements for MPBC to produce the production
services for a television show, consequently bypassing State budgetary
oversight. In addition, MPBC could not document the basis for approximately
$400,000 paid to its affiliated foundation during this same time period.
MPBC disagreed with certain of these findings and the related recommendations.
Given the significance of the underwriting and sponsorship agreements to fund
MPBC programming, we continue to believe that MPBC should implement the
recommendations included in our report.
