Enterprise Environmental Management System
(cid:190) MDE contracted with a vendor in January 2004
to provide EEMS. The total value of the
contract is $6.4 million. EEMS is intended to
provide a centralized database to enhance
environmental permitting, reporting,
compliance and enforcement activities.
(cid:190) The lack of a centralized reporting mechanism
for permits, inspections and penalties was
commented on in our three preceding audits.
(cid:190) As of March 2007, MDE had paid the vendor
$3.2 million under the EEMS contract.

$912,000 to cover cost overruns.

functionality.

Land Purchase
(cid:190) Funds totaling $1.8 million were provided by
MDE ($1.4 million loan) and the Maryland
Environmental Trust ($400,000 grant) so that a
bank could loan the funds to a private
foundation for the purchase of land (Finding 4).
(cid:190) MDE did not obtain two independent property
appraisals prior to funding the land purchase.
(cid:190) The loan agreement did not require the
foundation to immediately record a
conservation easement on the property. As of
July 2007, no easement had been recorded.
(cid:190) The owner of the foundation serves in an
advisory capacity to the Maryland
Environmental Trust Board of Directors.

wastewater facilities from paying into the Bay
Restoration Fund. Fund revenues totaled $113
million during the period from July 2004 to
December 2006 (Finding 5).
(cid:190) MDE did not ensure that lead paint properties

Facility Security
(cid:190) Security standards for hazardous material
facilities were not established timely by MDE,
delaying the completion of security analyses
and security audits (Finding 7).
(cid:190) Of the 99 potentially qualifying facilities, MDE
lacked documentation that it had verified the
exempt status claimed by 23 facilities from
related provisions of State law.
(cid:190) MDE had made no attempt to determine why
21 other facilities had not submitted a required
security analysis, and analyses for 17 facilities
had not been reviewed 6 to 10 months after
they were submitted.

Conclusions
(cid:190) MDE should fully disclose the status of EEMS
implementation to the General Assembly, and
obtain required Board of Public Works approval
for scope modifications.
(cid:190) Funds provided for land purchases should be
supported by two property appraisals, and
related loan agreements should require that
conservation easements be immediately
recorded.
(cid:190) MDE should monitor Special Fund programs to
ensure compliance with applicable State laws
and regulations.
(cid:190) MDE should take timely action to monitor
hazardous material facility security and conduct
required security audits, and to enhance
protection of the State’s drinking water systems.
