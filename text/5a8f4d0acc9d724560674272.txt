Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have audited the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (Fund) for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009. The Fund was established to preserve
productive agricultural land and is primarily funded by State and agricultural
transfer taxes and local subdivision matching funds. The Fund is administered by
the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF).
Our audit disclosed that MALPF’s database of easement acquisitions had not been
tested for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s accounting records. In addition,
MALPF needed to improve existing processes to ensure the accuracy of payments
related to easement acquisition installment purchases.
The Department of Agriculture’s response to this audit, on behalf of MALPF, is
included as an appendix to this report. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation
extended to us by MALPF during the course of this audit.
Respectfully submitted,
Bruce A. Myers, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) was
established to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland in Maryland.
MALPF, which is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of 13 members,
purchases land easements with Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund
(Fund) revenue and places certain restrictions on the use of the land (for example,
the land cannot be subdivided for residential or commercial purposes). The Fund,
which is administered by MALPF, generally derives revenues from State transfer
taxes, agricultural transfer taxes, local subdivision matching funds, and federal
grants. According to MALPF’s records, since inception through June 30, 2009, it
had purchased 2,018 easements on 277,000 acres of land for a total cost of
approximately $556 million.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the five findings contained
in our preceding audit report dated June 15, 2009. We determined that MALPF
satisfactorily addressed three of these findings. The remaining two findings are
repeated in this report.
Financial Information
Attached, as Exhibit A, is a schedule of the financial activity of the Fund for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. This schedule is not intended to, and does not
provide the financial position and results of operations in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Specifically, certain financial
statements (for example, a balance sheet) and disclosures have not been provided
as would be required by generally accepted accounting principles. The schedule
was prepared on a modified accrual basis of accounting which provides that
revenues are recognized when they become available and measurable, and
expenditures are recognized when the related liability is incurred.
The fund balance as of June 30, 2009 in the Special Revenue Fund ($11,284,477)
represents funds available to finance future expenditures, including easement
acquisitions. The fund balance as of June 30, 2009 in the Trust Fund
($12,711,892) represents funds committed for the payment of easements
purchased by MALPF on an installment basis.

Fund Status
MALPF recorded approximately $42 million in encumbrances at the end of fiscal
year 2009, which generally served to reserve funds for outstanding easement
offers and was consistent with the remaining budgetary appropriations from 2009
and prior fiscal years. As of June 30, 2009, the amount of such offers totaled
approximately $46 million. However, the Fund only had a balance of
approximately $11 million to be used for these obligations, resulting in a shortage
of $35 million. While in the past, shortages were caused, in part, by the
attainment of less than budgeted revenue; that was not the case for fiscal year
2009. Specifically, during fiscal year 2009, the actual revenues realized by
MALPF were approximately $38 million more than the estimated revenues of $35
million appropriated to MALPF and were used to make offers to purchase
easements for fiscal year 2009 and also to reduce the $66 million shortage noted
at the end of fiscal year 2008.
State law governing the Fund recognizes that estimated revenues may not be
realized. Accordingly, the law provides for adjustments in future years or de-
authorization of projects previously authorized.

Findings and Recommendations
Easement Acquisitions
Finding 1
The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation’s (MALPF)
database of easement acquisitions had not been tested for reliability nor
reconciled to the State’s accounting records.
Analysis
The database of easement acquisitions developed by MALPF had not been tested
for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s accounting records. MALPF’s
database of easements purchased contains information such as the number of
acres purchased and the related purchase price. However, as of December 31,
2009, the database had not been tested for accuracy and completeness. In
addition, the database had not been reconciled to the State’s accounting records.
MALPF management advised us that it anticipated completing the reliability
testing of the database by June 30, 2010. Consequently, there is a lack of
assurance that all easements were properly accounted for and reported.
During our review, we also noted a lack of reliable data supporting the total
cumulative cost of easement acquisitions reported in the MALPF Annual Report
to the General Assembly ($556 million) which exceeded the comparable amount
recorded on the State’s accounting records ($486 million) by $70 million.
Additionally, the cumulative cost of the easement acquisitions recorded in the
database totaled approximately $533 million.
The MALPF developed a database of easement acquisitions as recommended in
our preceding audit report. However, during our preceding audit, we also noted
that the amount of easement acquisitions reported to the General Assembly was
not supported and also had not been reconciled to the State’s accounting records.
These conditions continued to exist during our current audit.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MALPF
a. ensure the accuracy of the database of easement acquisitions,
b. ensure that easement information is accurately reported in its annual
report and periodically reconciled to the related State accounting records
(repeat), and
c. investigate the aforementioned discrepancies and take appropriate
corrective action (repeat).

Finding 2
Procedures and controls over easement acquisition payments related to
installment purchases were inadequate.
Analysis
Procedures and controls over easement acquisition payments related to
installment purchases were inadequate. Specifically, payments to landowners for
easement acquisitions purchased on an installment basis were not always subject
to independent review or approval. Although lump sum acquisition payments and
initial installment payments were subject to review by the Department of General
Services, no such review was required or performed for subsequent installment
payments. A similar situation was commented upon in our preceding audit report.
A landowner has the option of receiving either a lump sum payment for
easements acquired by MALPF, or may request that the purchase price, along
with related accumulated interest, be paid in installments over a ten-year period.
According to MALPF records, during fiscal year 2009, MALPF issued
installment payments totaling approximately $2.3 million.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that MALPF ensure that installment payments be reviewed
by an independent employee and that such reviews be documented (repeat).
County Agricultural Land Transfer Taxes
Finding 3
MALPF had not obtained formal legal advice regarding the legality of
recovering excessive amounts of agricultural land transfer taxes retained by
certain counties during prior fiscal years.
Analysis
MALPF had not obtained formal legal advice to determine the legality of
recovering excessive amounts of agricultural land transfer taxes retained by
certain counties during prior fiscal years. Specifically, during our preceding
audit, we noted that certain county land preservation programs were not properly
certified, in accordance with the regulations in effect at that time. These counties
retained a higher percentage of transfer taxes collected as allowed for counties
with certified programs. Since our preceding audit, the applicable regulations
have been amended to allow county land preservation programs to retain their
certification status unless the program is specifically decertified. Had the counties
been treated as non-certified and remitted the corresponding percentage of
transfer taxes, the counties identified would have been required to remit additional
7

--- Page 10 ---
funds to the State. As a result, MALPF needs formal legal advice to determine
whether any amounts retained by the counties in prior years should be recovered.
MALPF advised us that a memo requesting the legal advice has been drafted;
however, as of January 28, 2010, it was being reviewed internally prior to being
sent to its legal counsel.
Recommendation 3
We recommend that MALPF obtain formal legal advice to determine the
legality of recovering any excessive amounts retained by the counties in prior
years and take any appropriate action based on the advice obtained.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have audited the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (Fund) for
the fiscal ending June 30, 2009. The audit was conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine the Fund’s
financial transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance
with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations. We audit the Fund annually as
required by the Agriculture Article, Section 2-505 of the Code. We also
determined the status of the findings contained in our preceding audit report.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of materiality and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included disbursements for the purchase of easements, as
well as cash receipts, and compliance with easement terms. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and
records, and observations of the Fund’s operations. We also tested transactions
and performed other auditing procedures that we considered necessary to achieve
our objectives. Data provided in this report for background or informational
purposes were deemed reasonable, but were not independently verified.
Our audit did not include certain support services provided to the Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) by the Department of
Agriculture. These support services (such as purchasing, data processing,
maintenance of accounting records, and related fiscal functions) are included
within the scope of our audit of the Department.
MALPF management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes findings relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. Our report also includes a finding regarding a significant instance of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Other less significant
findings were communicated to the Fund that did not warrant inclusion in this
report.
The Department of Agriculture’s response, on behalf of the Foundation, to our
findings and recommendations is included as an appendix to this report. As
prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, we will advise the Department regarding the results of our
review of its response.

Responses to Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund Audit
ending June 30, 2009
Finding 1
The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation’s (MALPF) database of
easement acquisitions had not been tested for reliability nor reconciled to the State’s
accounting records.
We concur.
The purpose of this database has never been for financial accounting, but for management of the
program and policy analysis. The Department’s Fiscal Services Office maintains all accounting
records. Once critical records in new database are verified, accurate reporting will be available
based on relevant criteria for any historical point or time period.
Finding 2
Procedures and controls over easement acquisition payments related to installment
purchases were inadequate.
We concur.
The program will maintain detail information on installment payments. Each period, Treasurer’s
information along with the program detail of the installment payments will be forwarded to
Fiscal Services for review and approved for payment.
Finding 3
MALPF had not obtained formal legal advice regarding the legality of recovering excessive
amounts of agricultural land transfer taxes retained by certain counties during prior fiscal
years.
We concur.
The written advice has been drafted by the Department, and forwarded to the Department of
Planning for review. The Foundation will take the necessary action based on legal advice.
