Background (continued)
(cid:190) The Command has 161 authorized positions
including pilots, flight paramedics, technicians,
management and support personnel. Staffing is
provided by both troopers and civilian personnel.
(cid:190) Fiscal year 2007 expenditures totaled $22.3
million.
(cid:190) The Command flew an average of 8,000 missions
per year during the five year period from fiscal
year 2003 to 2007. Medevac missions comprise
over 60% of the total.
(cid:190) Eleven helicopters were purchased between 1989
and 1994. The remaining one was purchased in
1999. Age of the helicopters in the current fleet
is from 9 to 19 years.
(cid:190) Between September 1989 and October 2007, the
current fleet has logged almost 90,000 flight
hours without a NTSB reportable accident, injury
or fatality.

Audit Methodology
We conducted comprehensive reviews and tests of
numerous mission, maintenance, and personnel
records and automated systems. Much of this effort
was directed at developing meaningful statistics (not
always readily available) covering multiple years (e.g.,
FY 2003 to 2007) and verifying the reliability of
Command data. Our work included:
(cid:190) Interviewing more than 110 Command personnel,
(cid:190) Surveying other law enforcement agencies and
reviewing various industry data and FAA
regulations,
(cid:190) Assessing the controls over, and the
effectiveness of, the Command’s major data
information systems, and
(cid:190) Performing extensive tests of maintenance work
orders, inspection reports and flight records.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Use of helicopters for non-critical missions was
not deemed to be significant.
(cid:190) Better information systems are needed to
provide data needed to manage critical aspects
of its operations, including the identification of:
(cid:131) downtime by helicopter, and
(cid:131) all costs associated with maintenance to
help assess efficiency, appropriate staffing
levels and the cost/benefits of outsourcing.
(cid:190) Certain personnel policies and practices should
be addressed to foster more stable leadership,
reduce staff turnover and establish competitive
salaries.
(cid:190) A key performance measure needs to be better
defined and subject to quality assurance
processes to ensure the reliability of results.

Common Theme – Need for Better Data
Throughout the report, many findings were related
to the Command’s need for more complete and
accurate data on which to base management
decisions. For example,
(cid:190) Downtime information by individual helicopter
was not captured and section downtime data
was not reliable. (Objective 1)
(cid:190) Cost per flight hour could not be calculated
because certain helicopter and airplane costs
were comingled and the time spent servicing the
helicopters was not recorded or tracked. Also,
completed maintenance work was not recorded
on the automated aircraft maintenance and
inventory system. (Objective 2)
(cid:190) The automated database used to calculate the
“Golden Hour” performance measure was not
subject to periodic internal quality assurance
reviews. (Objective 4)

Office of Legislative Audits
Objective 1 - Helicopter Use & Availability
Mission Data
(cid:190) Helicopters were found to be used primarily for the
State’s critical missions (e.g., medevac) during FY
2003-2007, and other uses did not appear to
impact use and availability. (Finding 1)
(cid:190) The primary cause of mission cancellations was
ground responders subsequently determining that
services were not needed. (Finding 2)
Section & Aircraft Downtime Statistics
(cid:190) Although the Command maintains downtime by
section (i.e., the reason a section could not
respond to a call), the related database was
unreliable. Thirty-two of 61 entries tested did not
agree to the source documents. (Finding 3)
(cid:190) Downtime was not tracked by helicopter. Using
various sources, OLA estimated that for 51 days
during FY 2007, < 8 helicopters were in service,
and 6 were out of service > 120 days. (Finding 4)

Objective 2 - Maintenance Operations
Best Practices
(cid:190) OLA testing found that helicopter inspections
were conducted at proper intervals. (Finding 6)
Maintenance Costs
(cid:190) Costs for helicopter operations were not tracked
separately nor were actual labor hours spent on
helicopter inspections and repairs. (Finding 8)
(cid:190) A formal process was not in place to assess
when a contractor should be used for more
comprehensive/complex inspections, such as T
inspections (required every 600 flight hours).
Our review of 8 recent T inspections showed
that the 4 outsourced inspections were
completed significantly quicker than the 4 done
in-house. (Finding 9)

Objective 2 - Maintenance Operations (continued)
Maintenance Information Systems
(cid:190) Available features of the automated inventory
system were not used to ensure that critical
parts were on hand to meet expected needs.
Also, significant routine delivery delays were
noted; of 20 parts orders tested, 10 were
received >90 days after order, including 7
received >150 days after ordering. Also, vendor
records of open purchase orders often did not
include all open orders per the Command’s
records. (Finding 11)
(cid:190) A process was not in place to ensure that all FAA
directives or manufacturer service bulletins were
incorporated into inspection checklists. (Finding
12)

Objective 2 – Maintenance Operations (continued)
Physical Controls Over Parts & Supplies Inventories
(cid:190) Documented physical inventories of parts and
supplies were not conducted and inventory
records were often inaccurate. (Finding 14)
(cid:190) Access to the parts and supplies storeroom was
not properly restricted and controlled and
sufficient controls over withdrawals were lacking.
(Findings 15 and 16)
Manuals & Policies
(cid:190) Maintenance manuals were not always current.
For example, 4 avionics manuals had not been
updated for manufacturer revisions for 5 to 14
years. (Finding 17)
Other Findings
(cid:190) Policies to account for tools (to ensure tools were
not left in helicopters) were not always followed.
Also, current certificates documenting FAA-
required annual calibrations for 2 of 20 tools
tested could not be found. (Finding 19)

Objective 3 - Personnel, Staffing ,and Training
Organizational Structure
(cid:190) Given the Command’s comprehensive mission
profile and current staffing, the organizational
structure appears reasonable. (Finding 20)
Employee Turnover & Vacancies
(cid:190) Turnover in key management positions appears
to result in a lack of leadership continuity. Also,
qualifications for these positions had not been
formally established. (Finding 21)
(cid:190) Turnover and overtime costs for certain non-
management staff has increased.
(cid:131) OLA analysis of 5-year staffing trends (through
FY 2007) found an increase in turnover,
especially among pilots and technicians. For
example, during fiscal year 2007, turnover for
pilots and technicians was 16%.

Objective 3 - Personnel, Staffing and Training
(cont.)
Employee Turnover & Vacancies (continued)
(cid:131) Position vacancies have contributed to the
Command’s annual overtime expenditures
increasing from $530,000 to $1.17 million
between fiscal years 2004 and 2007.
(cid:131) Low salaries and the limited advancement
opportunities for civilian pilots and technicians
appear to be the primary causes of the turnover.
A large proportion of employees, mainly
technicians, have minimal experience with the
Command. For example, as of June 30, 2007,
11 of the 21 technicians had <5 years of service
with the Command, including 8 who had <1 year.
(cid:131) Considering the age of many pilots (33 are over
the age of 50) and the Command’s policy of
requiring pilot applicant’s to have at least 2,000
hours of flight time, hiring qualified
replacements under the current salary structure
could be challenging.

Objective 3 - Personnel, Staffing and Training
(cont.)
Training Enhancements
(cid:190) The Command had not complied with all
requirements in its FAA-approved
technician training manual, including the
development of a curriculum of training
courses. Also, OLA’s review of 10
technicians’ training files disclosed that
there had been no formal assessments of
training needs for 9 of the technicians as
required. (Finding 25)

Objective 4 – “Golden Hour” MFR Reliability
Background
(cid:190) For FYs 2005 and 2006, the Command had a
goal of completing 95% of medevac missions
within the “Golden Hour.” Reported results
were 94.81% and 94.36 %, respectively.
“Golden Hour” Definition
(cid:190) Actual statistic measured did not represent the
commonly understood definition of the “Golden
Hour,” which is the time between the
occurrence of the accident to patient delivery at
a trauma center. (Finding 26)
Data Reliability
(cid:190) The Command did not retain documentation to
support how it calculated its reported results,
necessitating a re-creation of results for audit
purposes, and also lacked an internal quality
assurance process. Review and testing of re-
created results indicated certain errors and
unexplained anomalies. (Finding 27)

Office of Legislative Audits
Objective 4 – “Golden Hour” MFR Reliability
Data Reliability (continued)
(cid:131) OLA test of time stamps from recorded voice
transmissions for 61 missions during FY
2007 found 10 errors in the recordation of
times into the automated records that are
used to calculate the reported results.
(cid:131) The automated records for FYs 2005 and
2006 included missions for which the
recorded duration appeared questionable.
These missions included some >1 day and
others <20 minutes. For example, in 2006,
the data included 242 missions out of
4,863 total completed missions with a
duration of 20 minutes or less.
Overall finding, based on inconsistent definition
and data issues, was that the OLA could not
conclude with respect to the reliability of the
reported FY 2005 and 2006 MFR results.

Conclusions
(cid:190) The Command’s helicopters were used almost
exclusively for critical missions.
(cid:190) The Command should improve its data systems and
information to more effectively manage its
operations.
(cid:190) The Command should implement processes and
procedures to better manage critical parts and
supplies. In addition, the Command should pursue
efforts to ensure the timely delivery of necessary
parts.
(cid:190) The Command should formally examine staffing and
pay issues to foster more stable leadership, help
minimize turnover and improve its flexibility and
authority in hiring, maintaining and promoting staff.
(cid:190) The Command should implement appropriate
procedures to ensure the accuracy of the
Command’s most publicized measure of its success
(timely patient transport to trauma centers).
