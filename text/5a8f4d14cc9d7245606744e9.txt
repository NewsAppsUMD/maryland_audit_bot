Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Baltimore City Police Department Death Relief Fund was established as an
instrumentality of the State of Maryland to pay special death benefits to eligible
beneficiaries (such as surviving spouse, children) upon the death of police officers
or civilian employees of the Baltimore City Police Department. The Fund is
administered by an elected Board of Trustees of the Baltimore City Police
Department Death Relief Fund which consists of nine members from the
Baltimore City Police Department (one major or higher rank, one deputy major,
one lieutenant, one sergeant, three patrolmen, one civilian employee, and the
Director of the Fiscal Affairs Division).
During calendar years 2010 through 2012, there were five approved payments
from the Fund for death benefits, which totaled $50,000. As of December 31,
2012, the Fund had a balance of approximately $505,000.
Financial Statement Audits
The Board of Trustees engaged the City of Baltimore Department of Audits to
perform an audit of the Fund’s financial statements for the calendar years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2010. In the related audit report, the Department stated
that the Fund’s financial statements for the aforementioned years were presented
fairly in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. We were advised that an audit of the Fund’s financial statements for the
calendar years ending December 31, 2011 and 2012 is scheduled to begin in April
2013.
Findings and Recommendations
Our audit did not disclose any significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of the Fund’s internal control. Nor did our audit disclose any significant instances
of noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. A less significant
finding was communicated to the Office that did not warrant inclusion in this
report.
A draft copy of this report was provided to the Fund. Since there are no
recommendations in this report, a written response was not necessary.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
As prescribed by Article 24, Section 16-106 of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we have audited the Baltimore City Police Department Death Relief Fund for the
period beginning January 27, 2010 and ending February 18, 2013. The audit was
conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives.
The objectives of this audit were to examine the Fund’s financial transactions,
records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance with applicable State
laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of materiality and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included disbursements from the Fund and compliance
with regulatory requirements. Our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, and observations of
the Fund’s operations. We also tested transactions and performed other auditing
procedures that we considered necessary to achieve our objectives. Data provided
in this report for background or informational purposes were deemed reasonable,
but were not independently verified.
The Fund’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
