AGENCY HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership
consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
The Commission has the following responsibilities:
1. Adopting the rules and regulations for the recreational and commercial taking or catching of
finfish, crabs, oysters and clams from the Potomac River;
2. Issuing licenses for the taking or catching of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams and for boats,
vessels, and related equipment;
3. Imposing an inspection tax on oysters caught in the Potomac River; and
4. Reseeding and replanting oyster bars.
The Commission’s regulations carry the full force and effect of law, and the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission jointly enforce the regulations.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the following
sources.
2008 2007
Virginia appropriations $175,000 $175,000
Maryland appropriations 175,000 175,000
Federal grant 97,583 104,772
Special grant - 22,500
Sport fishing licenses 94,103 93,148
Commercial fishing licenses 62,870 61,010
Commercial crab licenses 56,675 57,985
Commercial oyster licenses 6,730 13,845
Commercial clam licenses 200 -
Oyster bushel tax 1,325 4,795
Interest and miscellaneous 7,778 13,248
Total revenue $677,264 $721,303
The Commission saw a reduction in revenue for fiscal year 2008, as a result of significant decreases
in the sales of commercial oyster licenses and interest from investment pool accounts. The oyster population
in the Potomac River is declining, which has led to decreased sales of licenses and revenue from the oyster
bushel tax. During fiscal year 2007, the Commission received a special grant to support a contract for the
“Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement of Asian Oyster Introduction to the Chesapeake Bay”
project. The Commission completed this project during fiscal year 2008, but received no new revenue. The
Commission used $110,000 from their investment pool accounts to pay expenses during fiscal year 2008 as
discussed below. This drastically reduced the balance in the accounts, which led to a decrease in the interest
earned.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years.
2008 2007
Personnel services $360,417 $350,887
Federal grant 92,052 99,265
Contractual services 200,194 70,140
Development and repletion 97,663 55,568
Materials and supplies 41,371 46,432
Insurance 6,659 5,481
Fixed assets 706 2,819
Total expenses $799,062 $630,592
Expenses increased by $168,470 from fiscal year 2007. During fiscal year 2008, the Commission
began a project to replace the jurisdictional markers in the upper section of the Potomac River at a cost of
approximately $120,000. The Commission originally placed these markers at the mouths of all the rivers and
tributaries that feed into the Potomac River and must replace them every 10-15 years. Another large increase
in expenses was for development and repletion. During fiscal year 2008, the Commission received material
from the demolition of the old Woodrow Wilson Bridge to use in an artificial reef project. The Commission
incurred costs for the transportation of the bridge material and creation of the artificial reef.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2008 with an overall operating loss of $121,798. A large portion
of this loss is a result of project costs for the replacement of the jurisdictional markers and the creation of the
artificial reef. The Commission was able to handle this operating loss by using funds in its investment pool
accounts accumulated over the past several years in anticipation of the periodic costs of replacing the
jurisdictional markers. The Commission closed fiscal year 2008 with a cash balance of $62,219, including
$12,342 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts.

We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission for
the year ended June 30, 2008. We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions
based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions in the
Commission’s accounting system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls, test compliance
with applicable laws and regulations, and review corrective actions of audit findings from prior year reports.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal control
and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and
efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual, sufficient to plan
the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. Our
review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of transactions, and account balances.
Capital assets
Contractual services expenses
Payroll expenses
Appropriations
Cash receipting
License revenues
Federal grant revenues and expenses
Information security

We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had been
placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with provisions of
applicable laws and regulations. Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection
of documents, records, and contracts, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We tested
transactions and performed analytical procedures, including budgetary and trend analyses. We confirmed
bank balances with outside parties.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded and
reported in the Commission’s accounting records. The Commission records its financial transactions on the
cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information presented in this report came
directly from the Commission’s accounting system.
We noted no matters involving internal control and its operation that we consider necessary to be
reported to management. The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations disclosed
no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing
Standards.
The Commission has taken adequate corrective action with respect to the audit finding reported in the
prior year that is not repeated in this letter.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on May 13, 2009.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
