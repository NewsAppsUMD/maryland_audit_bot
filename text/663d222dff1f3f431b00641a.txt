Dear Senator Guzzone and Delegate Barnes:
The Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by the Maryland
Department of Health (MDH) Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) to resolve the
four repeat findings in our October 26, 2022 audit report. This review was conducted in
accordance with a requirement specified in the April 2023 Joint Chairmen’s Report (JCR), page
118. The JCR required that, prior to the release of $100,000 of its administrative appropriation
for fiscal year 2024, DDA must take corrective action on all repeat audit findings on or before
November 1, 2023. The JCR language further provided that OLA submit a report to the budget
committees listing each repeat audit finding along with a determination that each repeat finding
was corrected. The OLA report is required to be submitted to allow 45 days for the budget
committees to review and release the funds prior to the end of the fiscal year.
The October 26, 2022 audit report of DDA contained four repeat audit findings (findings
1, 2, 3, 6) that were addressed by eight recommendations. In accordance with the April 2023
JCR requirement, DDA provided a status report to OLA, dated November 1, 2023, detailing
certain corrective actions that had been completed and actions that were ongoing with respect to
all four repeat audit findings (Exhibit 1). The DDA status report indicated that, with the
exception of one of four elements of Finding 6, its corrective action for each of the four findings
was incomplete as of November 1, 2023.

Delegate Benjamin S. Barnes, Chair
We reviewed the DDA status report and related documentation, performed limited tests
and analyses of the information, and held discussions with DDA personnel as necessary to assess
the implementation status of the related recommendations. Our review did not constitute an
audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Based on our review, we determined that DDA had not yet taken sufficient actions to
correct Findings 1, 2, 3, and 6. Specifically, although DDA had implemented certain elements of
the recommendations related to Findings 1, 2, 3, and 6, the actions to date did not address the
entirety of the findings (Exhibit 2). Consequently, at the time of our review, our assessment of
Findings 1, 2, 3 and 6 concluded that they were still in progress (Exhibit 3).
After discussing our review results, DDA generally agreed with the accuracy of the
information presented. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the
review by DDA. We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the JCR requirement. Please
contact me if you need additional information.
Sincerely,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA

Mr. Gregory A. Hook, CPA

The Warehouse at Camden Yards
351 West Camden Street, Suite 400
Baltimore, MD 21201
Dear Mr. Hook:
In response to your letter dated November 9, 2023, the Maryland Department of Health (MDH)
is submitting the attached Joint Chairmen’s Report (JCR) Status regarding the Office of
Legislative Audits’ (OLA) October 22, 2022, report on the Developmental Disabilities
Administration (DDA). As described in the attachment, DDA has made significant progress on
all the repeat findings identified in the OLA report. For example, DDA:
● Competitively procured the services of a Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) to
assist in the oversight of Coordination of Community Service (CCS) agencies.
● Developed expectations for and is monitoring the QIO as this vendor executes various
reviews and audits of the CCS agencies.
● Developed and executed competitive contracts for Fiscal Management and Consulting
Services (FMCS).
● Created procedures, guidance, and dashboards for more effective monitoring and
oversight of the FMCS vendors.
While we do not consider any of the corrective actions final, DDA has worked diligently over
the past year to address internal process weaknesses and to improve the efficiency with which
MDH delivers services to this important constituency. Further, we expect corrective actions to
be complete on all repeat findings by March 31, 2024.
Sincerely,
Laura Herrera Scott, MD, MPH
Secretary of Health

developed a dashboard, created a monthly report card, and held weekly
meetings with vendors.
According to DDA, the quality assurance reports received from the
start of the contract through November 2023 did not capture the
necessary data for monitoring FMCS vendors and participants.
DDA has analyzed the reports and finalized fields required for
reporting purposes. DDA expects December monthly reports to
provide sufficient data to accurately measure quality of service
provided by the FMCS vendors.
DDA has developed the DDA QIO Contract Monitor Guidance and
DDA Utilization and Qualified Provider Review Standard Operating
Procedures Guidance.
According to the Contract Monitor, the process and communications
with the QIO related to Self -direction reviews will start by 12/11/23.
The utilization reviews are expected to begin 1/1/24 and the reviews
will cover the period starting from 7/2023. DDA needs to ensure
compliance with the Community Pathways Waivers with respect to site
visits.
Note: Per the HQ Chief Operating Officer, all QIO reviews start as
remote audits; based on the outcome of the remote audits, for
example if requested documentation is not submitted, or unmet
findings hit a certain threshold, then onsite reviews are triggered.
This would also include interviewing participants as warranted.
The DDA has received FY22 audited financial statements for one
vendor.
DDA developed written procedures for reviewing FMCS vendor’s'
monthly invoices. DDA is reconciling and considering clipping future
payments when an overpayment has been identified.

Exhibit 1 to May 8, 2024 Letter to Joint Chairmen
Remaining Tasks
DDA needs to continue to meet with FMCS vendors on a regular basis,
review quality assurance reports and update monthly report cards.
DDA needs to review FMCS vendors annual audited financial
statements.
DDA is in the process of creating Fiscal Standard Operating
Procedures to address the review of vendor’s annual audited statements
for unqualified results and liquidity. Per CM, audited financial
statements are due for traditional providers no later than 12/31 of the
respective fiscal year due to the time it takes for a majority of auditors
to complete their audits. This will be updated in the next Request For
Proposal, and in any modifications to the current contract. Per the CM,
FY23 audited financial statements are due no later than 12/31/2023.
According to the RFP, "The Contractor will submit to the Contract
Monitors: 1) Its annual audited financial statement, within four (4)
months of the close of the Contractor’s fiscal year."
DDA needs to continue to reconcile vendor monthly payments to
ensure payments are proper and supported.
Once additional documentation is received to address this
recommendation, IAC/S will select a sample of transactions to test.

Remaining tasks
DDA needs to develop a process to ensure FMCS vendors are
processing payments timely as well as a process for reviewing and
tracking denied claims prior to January 2023 until resolved. Contracts
do not specify a timeline for entering provider payments into MMIS II
or sharing denied claims activity with DDA.
Recommendation 6d
We recommend that DDA take appropriate corrective action to recover
unspent funds and obtain available federal reimbursement for any
outstanding claims (including the aforementioned $8.8 million), and consider
recovering any lost investment income resulting from untimely vendor
actions (repeat).

Per DDA, they have investigated the account and have identified $1.9
million (FY19 & FY20) as the current balance of potential claims that
are potentially uncollectible. DDA is still investigating this balance.
Once this research has been completed, MDH plans to disclose and
discuss the remaining balance with DBM and GAD to determine next
steps. We anticipate this happening by the end of the calendar year
(2023) and will share this information with OLA.

--- Page 16 ---
Exhibit 1 to May 8, 2024 Letter to Joint Chairmen
The decrease in the amount from $8.8 million is due to (1) Support
Broker Fees that were not a waiver service in FY19 and not eligible for
federal reimbursement, (2) administrative claims that would not be part
of the Medicaid claim process, (3) individuals deemed not eligible for
Waiver service and would not be eligible for federal reimbursement,
and (4) related federal reimbursements for claims that were submitted
for FFP under old procedure codes. DDA will continue to research.
Note: IAC/S has not reviewed documentation supporting these
actions
Based on DDA's review of FY19 and FY20 claims submitted, there
was no lost investment income resulting from untimely vendor actions.
DDA developed a spreadsheet utilized to track when the administration
contacts the FMS vendors related to billing, coding, claims submission
guidance, etc.
Remaining tasks
DDA needs to review FMS vendor’s FY21-FY23 reconciliations to
confirm if unspent funds are due back to DDA and determine if there
was lost investment income.
DDA needs to implement a process for reviewing and tracking FY21-
FY23 denied claims until resolved.
Once IAC/S reviews a process to address this recommendation, a
sample of transactions will be selected to test.

OLA’s Assessments Regarding Repeat Findings and Recommendations That
Were Not Resolved

We recommend that DDA establish a process to ensure that CCS agencies provide all
critical services to consumers in accordance with State regulations. Specifically, DDA
should ensure that the CCS agencies complete
b. all quarterly monitoring forms as required for each consumer (repeat),
and
c. quarterly monitoring forms which contain detailed comments regarding
consumers’ progress on achieving personal goals and outcomes (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that while DDA developed a process to ensure that Coordination of
Community Services (CCS) agencies completed all required quarterly monitoring forms, the
process was not effective. Specifically, DDA advised that in November 2022 it established a
Long Term Services and Supports System (LTSS) report to track that forms were submitted for
each consumer and sent monthly follow-up notices to the CCS agencies for consumers whose
forms were not submitted. However, LTSS data provided by DDA showed virtually no change
in the level of compliance by the CCS agencies between November 2022 and November 2023;
as during this period the CCS agencies had not completed more than 75 percent of the required
forms. Therefore, the process as currently designed was not sufficient to address the
recommendation.
In addition, although DDA procured services with a vendor in July 2022 to review completed
quarterly monitoring forms to ensure they contained detailed comments regarding consumers’
progress, as of January 2024, the first of these reviews was not yet complete.
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 2
We recommended that DDA
a. establish a comprehensive review process to ensure that CCS agency
billings are proper (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that while DDA established a review process to ensure that CCS agency
billings are proper, the process was not as comprehensive as needed and, consequently, it did not
address the specific recommendation. Specifically, DDA contracted with a vendor to review a
sample of the CCS agencies’ billings to ensure only billable activities were included and
appropriately supported; however, these reviews did not include an assessment of the

--- Page 20 ---
Exhibit 3 to May 8, 2024 Letter to Joint Chairmen
reasonableness of the amounts billed versus the delivery (or lack of delivery) of all required
services such as annual plans and quarterly monitoring visits.
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 3
We recommended that DDA
a. conduct audits of providers to ensure payments to providers were
consistent with actual services delivered and in accordance with the consumers’
approved plans (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that DDA contracted with a vendor to conduct audits to ensure payments to
providers were consistent with actual services delivered and in accordance with consumers’
approved plans. Specifically, the vendor conducted a review of provider payments for the period
from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022, which identified approximately $6,500 in
payments to be recovered; however, as of January 2024 DDA had only pursued recovery of one
payment totaling $248. In addition, although the vendor had initiated a review of provider
payments for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, this review was still in progress as of January
2024.
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 6
We recommended that DDA
b. monitor vendor activity and compliance to ensure that all key requirements and terms
are complied with, including site visits and audits, and timely return of unspent funds,
and that FMS vendor payments are proper and supported (repeat);
d. take appropriate corrective action to recover unspent funds and obtain available federal
reimbursement for any outstanding claims (including the aforementioned $8.8 million),
and consider recovering any lost investment income resulting from untimely vendor
actions (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that DDA had developed procedures to monitor the Fiscal Management
and Counseling Services (FMCS) vendors to ensure compliance with all key contract terms and
requirements, and that vendor payments were proper and supported, but as of January 2024 the
procedures had not been fully implemented. As of January 2024, DDA was still in the process of
taking appropriate corrective action to recover unspent funds and obtain available federal
reimbursement for outstanding claims. DDA also had not yet determined whether it could
recover lost investment income that resulted from untimely vendor actions.
