Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA) is
responsible for developing comprehensive
treatment and rehabilitation services for
individuals with mental illness. MHA’s functions
include:
(cid:131) overseeing the provision of publicly funded
services for the care and treatment of
individuals with mental disorders;
(cid:131) supervising State mental health facilities;
and
(cid:131) reviewing and approving local government
plans for treatment of the mentally ill
(cid:190) MHA’s expenditures during FY 2007 totaled
approximately $575 million, the vast majority of
which was incurred for mental health services.
(cid:190) Our audit included 11 findings, 3 of which were
repeated from the preceding audit report.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) MHA did not ensure that provider rates used to
obtain federal reimbursement for eligible services
were correct and, as a result, $1.15 million in
federal funds was not claimed in CY 2006. Eligible
provider claims were not always submitted for
reimbursement within the required timeframe.
(cid:190) MHA had inadequate procedures for reviewing
authorization decisions made by its administrative
service organization (ASO), which was paid $14.4
million during FY 2007, and the ASO did not meet
certain contract requirements.
(cid:190) Interest income totaling $1.8 million earned on
funds use to pay providers was not transferred to
the State’s General Fund.
(cid:190) Independent reviews of provider claims paid by the
ASO excluded certain verification procedures and
problems found were not always investigated.
(cid:190) Sufficient action was not taken to recover provider
advances totaling $737,000.

Federal Funds
(cid:190) MHA did not ensure that federal reimbursement
rates received for certain eligible services
corresponded to the related service rates paid to
providers. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) Our analysis of CY 2006 claims paid
disclosed approximately 270,000 claims for
which the related federal reimbursement was
based on amounts totaling $2.3 million less
than the actual service rates paid to the
providers.
(cid:131) Consequently, the State received $1.15
million (50 percent federal reimbursement of
$2.3 million) less in federal funding than it
would have if the actual claim amount had
been used to calculate the federal
reimbursement.
(cid:131) Prior to our analysis, MHA had not identified
this situation nor initiated any necessary
corrective action.

Federal Funds (continued)
(cid:190) Eligible provider claims were not always submitted
for federal reimbursement within the timeframe
required by federal regulations. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) Federal regulations require that claims be
submitted within a specified two-year period
after payment to the provider.
(cid:131) OLA test of 26 claims paid by the ASO found 7
that appeared to have exceeded the two-year
period, and federal reimbursement totaling
approximately $43,000 had not been
obtained for those claims.
(cid:131) Federal authorities advised that there are only
a limited number of exceptions to the time
requirement, and MHA had no documentation
that the tested claims met any of these
exceptions.

Administrative Service Organization (ASO)
(cid:190) MHA lacked adequate procedures for
systematically reviewing service authorization
decisions made by the ASO. The ASO paid $475
million for provider claims in FY 2007. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) Although State regulations require MHA to
regularly and systematically review the ASO’s
authorization decisions, MHA could not
document how it selected these decisions for
review, including sample size, types of service
to examine, and frequency of such reviews.
(cid:131) For example, MHA reviewed 12 inpatient
hospital authorizations decisions made by the
ASO during FY 2007, even though the ASO
authorized approximately 20,000 inpatient
stays in the first 6 months of that year. We
question whether the sample selected for
review was sufficiently comprehensive.

Administrative Service Organization (continued)
(cid:190) The ASO did not perform the number of
contractually required inpatient claim audits.
(cid:131) The contract requires the ASO to audit,
including a review of related billing and
medical records, claims filed by a minimum
of 6 inpatient facilities per year to ensure
claim accuracy.
(cid:131) As of June 30, 2007, only 2 such audits had
been performed since inception of the
contract in October 2004; while inpatient
claims paid from July 2006 to April 2007
totaled $75.6 million. (Finding 4)
(cid:190) Interest income earned in a bank account
established by MHA for the ASO’s use in
processing claims had not been transferred to
the State’s General Fund since the account’s
inception in October 2004, as required by the
State Treasurer. As of June 2007, interest
earned totaled approximately $1.8 million.

Contractor Claim Reviews
(cid:190) Independent reviews of provider claims paid by
the ASO did not include certain critical verification
procedures. (Finding 6)
(cid:131) MHA contracted with a private entity to
perform periodic reviews of selected claims
processed by the ASO for the purpose of
ensuring compliance with certain
requirements, such as proper authorization.
(cid:131) The entity’s procedures excluded certain
critical attributes, such as verifying that
claims paid entirely from State funds were not
actually eligible for federal reimbursement,
and that the claims were submitted by
providers within the timeframe required by
State regulations.
(cid:131) We noted paid claims totaling $39,000 that
had been miscoded as not eligible for federal
reimbursement.

Contractor Claim Reviews (continued)
(cid:190) Deficiencies and discrepancies identified by the
contractor’s reviews of the ASO were not always
investigated and resolved. (Finding 7)
(cid:131) Reports issued by the contractor often
noted potential problems relating to claims
examined, such as instances in which the
amount paid to a provider for a particular
service was different than the established
rate.
(cid:131) MHA generally relied on the contractor to
resolve such issues, but the contractor’s
reports frequently noted that no
explanation or resolution was obtained,
and the issues were not pursued further.

Provider Advances
Sufficient action had not been taken to collect
provider advances totaling approximately
$737,000. (Finding 9)
(cid:131) These funds had been advanced several
years ago for various reasons, including
delays in processing claims by the former
ASO (pre-October 2004).
(cid:131) MHA had no documentation that action had
been taken to recover these amounts, such
as offsetting future claims from the provider
or submission to the Department of Budget
and Management’s Central Collection Unit.
(cid:131) During CY 2006, one provider with
outstanding advances of $187,000
received claim payments of approximately
$4 million that possibly could have been
used to offset the amount due.

Conclusion
MHA should:
(cid:190) ensure the propriety of federal reimbursement for
paid claims and recover any amounts due when
reimbursement was based on less than the actual
claims paid. Furthermore, claims for federal
reimbursement should be submitted within the
required timeframe.
(cid:190) establish adequate procedures to select ASO
service authorization decisions to ensure sufficient
review coverage, and ensure that the ASO conducts
the required number of claim audits.
(cid:190) verify that interest income is regularly transferred to
the State’s General Fund.
(cid:190) ensure that procedures used in contractor claim
reviews include all critical verification procedures,
and that significant deficiencies and discrepancies
noted are investigated and resolved.
(cid:190) initiate recovery procedures for outstanding
provider advances.
