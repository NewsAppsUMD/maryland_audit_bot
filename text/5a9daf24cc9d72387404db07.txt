Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation
Foundation (MALPF) was established to preserve
productive agricultural land and woodland in
Maryland.
(cid:190) MALPF purchases land easements with Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (the “Fund”)
revenue and places certain restrictions on the use
of the land.
(cid:190) The Fund, which is administered by the MALPF,
generally derives revenues from State transfer
taxes, agricultural transfer taxes, local subdivision
matching funds, and federal grants.
(cid:190) According to MALPF records, since inception
through June 30, 2007, MALPF had purchased
1,941 easements on 266,000 acres of land for a
total cost of $490 million.

Overview of Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) MALPF did not maintain a comprehensive listing
of easements purchased and could not support
amounts reported to the General Assembly.
(cid:190) MALPF lacked adequate procedures for ensuring
counties were invoiced for their share of
easement acquisition costs and properly reported
their collection and use of agricultural land
transfer taxes.
(cid:190) MALPF lacked procedures for ensuring that
counties performed inspections to determine
landowners were complying with easement
agreements.
(cid:190) The Fund’s 2007 fiscal year end balance was $34
million and outstanding easement offers totaled
$91 million.

Easement Record Keeping
(cid:190) MALPF did not maintain a comprehensive listing of
all easements purchased, with such detailed
information as the purchase price and the number
of acres covered by the easement. (Finding 1)
(cid:190) The easement value reported to the General
Assembly in MALPF’s Annual Report submitted in
February 2008 ($490 million) exceeded the
amount recorded on the State’s accounting
records ($337 million) by $153 million.
(cid:131) $91 million of this difference could be
explained as current offers that had not been
recorded on the State’s records.
(cid:131) Remaining $62 million difference could not be
readily explained by MALPF management.
(cid:190) MALPF management advised us that a new
database was in the process of being manually
updated with the detailed easement information
from the inception of the Fund to date.

Accounting for County Easement Costs
(cid:190) MALPF lacked adequate procedures for ensuring
that the counties were invoiced for their share of
easement acquisitions costs. We identified one
county that was not invoiced $390,000 for its
share of a FY 2007 easement acquisition that was
not detected by MALPF because there was no
procedure to ensure all such acquisitions were
matched to billing records. (Finding 2)
(cid:190) MALPF did not ensure counties submitted annual
reports required by State regulations. The reports
document the transfer taxes collected by the
county, the nature of the counties’ use of the
taxes, and whether any unexpended taxes were
due to the State. (Finding 4)
(cid:131) As of May 2008, MALPF had not received the
fiscal year 2006 reports (due in October 2006)
from 9 of the 17 counties tested.
(cid:131) Reports that were received were not always
prepared in accordance with State regulations.

Monitoring of County Easement Inspections
(cid:190) MALPF lacked procedures for ensuring inspections
of easement properties were performed as
required and had not established a follow-up policy
when a county did not perform the required
inspections. (Finding 5)
(cid:190) Our review of calendar year 2006 inspections
disclosed that MALPF had not received 97 of the
173 inspections required for easements acquired
with State and local funds and had not followed up
with any of the counties delinquent in submitting
the inspections.
(cid:190) As a result, there was a lack of assurance that
landowners were in compliance with the provisions
stipulated in the easement agreements. The failure
to obtain the required inspections has been
commented upon in our five preceding audit
reports dating back to June 3, 2003.

Fund Status
(cid:190) At the end of FY 2007 MALPF had recorded $91
million in encumbrances, generally representing
the value of outstanding easement offers, but only
had $34 million in the Fund available for these
obligations. (page 8 of the audit report)
(cid:190) The $57 million shortage in funds was primarily
caused by the attainment of less transfer tax
revenue than the amount budgeted.
(cid:190) State law governing the Fund recognizes that
estimated revenues may not be realized and
provides for adjustments in future years or the
eventual de-authorization of projects previously
authorized.

Conclusion
(cid:190) MALPF should maintain a comprehensive
accurate listing of easements purchased and
ensure amounts reported to the General
Assembly are properly supported.
(cid:190) MALPF should establish procedures for ensuring
counties were invoiced for their share of
easement acquisition costs and properly used
their share of agricultural land transfer taxes.
(cid:190) MALPF should ensure that counties performed
the required easement inspections and follow
up with counties delinquent in submitting the
required inspections.
