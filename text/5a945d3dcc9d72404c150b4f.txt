Background Information and Purpose of Review
According to the State's records, State aid totaling approximately $256.2 million
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was granted to 15 of Maryland's 16
community colleges. This aid primarily consisted of funding based on cost and
student enrollment data. In addition, it included certain retirement benefits and
various other grants. The remaining college (Baltimore City Community College)
is a budgetary unit of the State and receives an annual State appropriation.
Baltimore City Community College is not subject to the Education Article,
Section 16-315(h) of the Annotated Code of Maryland; however, it obtains annual
financial audits that are conducted by a certified public accounting firm. The
College is also subject to fiscal compliance audits by the Office of Legislative
Audits. We issue separate reports on the College, which contain information
regarding the results of these audits.
The Education Article, Section 16-315(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) to adopt
guidelines for the preparation of annual audit reports on the colleges. The
guidelines promulgated by MHEC require independent auditors to express
opinions as to the fairness of presentation of the colleges’ financial statements as
well as to the cost and student enrollment data used for calculating the State aid to
the colleges. The guidelines also require the auditors to issue management letters
containing all material weaknesses in the colleges’ systems of internal controls.
While not required, many of the auditors issue management letters that contain
non-material weaknesses.
We reviewed the audit reports of the State’s community colleges for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2010 to determine compliance with the applicable statutes
and the guidelines promulgated by MHEC. We also reviewed the reports to
determine if any of the community colleges had deficit net asset balances, or
uninsured/uncollateralized bank deposits. This report contains the results of that
review.

Results of Review
Audit Reports
All 15 audit reports for fiscal year 2010 were filed timely.
Our review disclosed that all 15 community college audit reports were filed
timely with MHEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.
The State’s community colleges are required by law to file annual audit reports
within 90 days of the fiscal year end (June 30) unless an extension is granted.
All audit reports expressed unqualified opinions and were in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards.
Our review disclosed that all 15 community college audit reports for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2010 contained unqualified opinions from their auditors and
were presented in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
MHEC’s audit guidelines require the auditors to express opinions as to the
fairness of the presentation of the colleges’ financial statements and that the audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. An
unqualified opinion is issued when the auditor states that the applicable financial
statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
One community college disclosed a deficit balance in the unrestricted portion
of its net assets at June 30, 2010.
Our review disclosed one college with a deficit balance in the unrestricted
component of its net assets as of June 30, 2010. Specifically, Carroll Community
College had an unrestricted net assets deficit of $3,505,324. Since the College’s
invested in capital assets component had a balance of $1,732,423, which offsets
the unrestricted net assets deficit, the total net assets deficit was $1,772,901 as of

June 30, 2010. Furthermore, this situation was also noted in regard to the
financial statements for this College in fiscal year 2009. A deficit net assets
balance indicates that a college has more liabilities than assets and could indicate
a potential financial problem.
We did not perform a detailed analysis to determine the cause of this deficit;
nevertheless, the College’s financial statements and accompanying notes
contained certain pertinent information relative to the deficit. Specifically, the
College’s financial statements disclosed that the decrease in net assets in fiscal
year 2010 of approximately $1.4 million was due primarily to the other post
employment benefit liability which increased by $2.3 million during fiscal year
2010.
Generally accepted accounting principles specify that liabilities for post
employment benefits, which are deferred until retirement or another future event,
be recognized in the years in which the employee provides services rather than
during the postemployment period when payments are made.
Management Letters
Management letters for fiscal year 2010 included a total of 30
recommendations for improvement, including a total of 11 recommendations
considered to be material weaknesses in five colleges’ systems of internal
control.
We reviewed the management letters applicable to the audits of the community
colleges that were filed with MHEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Our
review disclosed that six of the community colleges did not receive any
recommendations, while the remaining nine community colleges received a total
of 30 recommendations, 11 of which were considered material weaknesses in the
colleges’ systems of internal control. The material weaknesses were found to
exist at Community College of Baltimore County, College of Southern Maryland,
Garrett College, Montgomery Community College, and Prince George’s
Community College and were related to the colleges’ grants, financial reporting,
financial aid, fixed assets, student enrollment reporting, and information systems.
As required by the Education Article, Section 16-315(c) of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, MHEC evaluated the adequacy of the colleges’ responses to the
material weaknesses and determined that appropriate follow-up action had been
taken.

MHEC did not formally evaluate the adequacy of the colleges’ responses to the
19 non-material recommendations since, in accordance with MHEC’s guidelines,
comments and suggestions related to non-material weaknesses are not required.
When auditors include such items in the letters, the colleges’ follow-up actions
are subject to the auditors’ review during subsequent audits.
The following schedule provides a summary of the fiscal year 2010
recommendations by fiscal area. Seven of the 30 recommendations (4 of which
were also considered material weaknesses in 2009) were repeated from the
preceding year.

Fiscal Area of Recommendation Recommendations
Financial aid 10
Grants and contracts 8
Accounting and financial reporting 4
Student enrollment and residency 3
Fixed assets, inventory 2
