Supplemental Retirement Plans
– Investment Contract Pool
Original Hotline Allegation: possible lack of disclosure of losses
incurred in the Investment Contract Pool (ICP)
Background
(cid:190) The Board of Trustees (Board) of the Maryland Teachers
and State Employees Supplemental Retirement Plans
(MSRP) is responsible for implementing, maintaining, and
administering the State’s voluntary tax sheltered income
deferral plans for State employees and others.
(cid:190) These plans are permitted under various sections of the
Internal Revenue Code. The ICP is available as an
investment option in the 401(a), 401(k), and 457 Plans.
Plan assets are held in trust for the plan participants.
(cid:190) The ICP’s objective is to preserve principal and provide a
stable, competitive return for participants.
(cid:190) A number of consultants have been hired to advise and
assist the Board in managing the ICP.
(cid:190) MSRP’s investment manager reported that the 12/31/08
book value of ICP investments totaled $729 million for
27,163 employees in the ICP, making the ICP the single
most popular investment option offered by MSRP based on
amounts invested. In total, $1.9 billion was invested in all
plans as of 12/31/08 (38% of that was in the ICP).

Supplemental Retirement Plans
– Investment Contract Pool (continued)
Key Findings:
(cid:190) Inadequate Disclosure of Unrealized Losses
(cid:131) MSRP did not adequately disclose unrealized losses
of the ICP investments (the aggregate market values
were less than purchase prices) in financial reports
made available to existing and prospective plan
participants (see page 11 for example).
(cid:131) The unrealized losses were not disclosed in MSRP’s
2007 audited financial statements. As of
12/31/08, unrealized ICP losses totaled
approximately $48 million.
(cid:131) MSRP did not confirm the existence of ICP
investments with the custodian bank.
(cid:190) Lack of Independent Verifications
(cid:131) Documentation was not available to substantiate
that the market value of ICP investments had been
independently verified.
(cid:131) MSRP did not independently verify the accuracy of
the interest rate calculated by the investment
manager that was used to credit earnings to
participant accounts.

Supplemental Retirement Plans
– Investment Contract Pool (continued)
Key Findings: (continued)
(cid:190) Protection Afforded by Wrapper Agreements Unclear
(cid:131) Wrapper agreements executed with financial
institutions to cover ICP investment losses were
highly complex and ambiguous.
(cid:131) MSRP personnel and the investment manager
were unable to clearly explain how the agreements
preserved the investment portfolio.
(cid:131) Certain agreements were apparently not signed
until after we requested them during this review.
(cid:190) Lack of Documentation of Monitoring:
(cid:131) MSRP management and the MSRP Board did not
adequately document their monitoring of the
performance of the investment manager and the
sub-managers. Performance reports prepared by
MSRP’s investment consultant indicated the ICP
was outperformed by comparable investment plans
for the 3-year and 5-year periods ending
12/31/08.
