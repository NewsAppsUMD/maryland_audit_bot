Executive Summary
We conducted a performance audit of certain operational aspects of the Blind
Industries and Services of Maryland (BISM). The audit included an evaluation
of BISM's employment and training strategies for the blind, pricing policies
and practices for supplies and services sold to State agencies, and executive
compensation processes. The audit was conducted at the direction of the
General Assembly’s Joint Audit Committee.
BISM is a nonprofit organization that conducts manufacturing and retail
operations and provides employment in Maryland and other states, and
provides rehabilitation and training programs primarily to blind adults of
Maryland. Its mission is to “provide stable career opportunities, innovative
rehabilitation programs, quality products and services, and to develop
resources for training and education.” BISM’s operations are primarily funded
through product sales, which totaled $84 million during fiscal year 2015, of
which approximately $10.5 million represented sales to State agencies. As of
June 30, 2015, BISM employed 578 associates (216 blind and 362 sighted).
During fiscal year 2015, BISM provided rehabilitation and training services to
784 persons, which was funded by both the State and BISM.
Employment and Training Strategies
Until September 2015, BISM had not formally adopted strategies to
accomplish organizational goals for 2020 that it established in 2013. Since
then, BISM has not taken the next step of developing action plans or
measures to assess the success of its efforts. Action plans are essential if
BISM hopes to achieve its 2020 goals, such as of increasing sales to $250
million, which equates to approximately tripling its current annual sales
activity, and increasing employment to 750 individuals, representing an
increase of 67 percent over the next five years. Whether future employment
increases would include Maryland blind residents is unknown; BISM recently
advised that it is unaware of any Maryland blind residents seeking
employment opportunities with BISM.
BISM conducts outreach programs to inform Maryland residents throughout
the State of its rehabilitation and training programs and services.
Representatives from certain State and county health and human services
agencies indicated that they were unaware of any individuals who requested
services BISM offers that had not been served.
Over the years, BISM has assumed more financial responsibility for funding its
rehabilitation and training programs. Although the budget committees of the
5

--- Page 8 ---
Maryland General Assembly, in the past, had expressed the intent that BISM
move toward self-sufficiency for the program costs, it appears this issue is no
longer a concern. During fiscal year 2015, BISM’s rehabilitation and training
expenditures totaled approximately $1,579,000 of which $876,000 was
funded by the State and $703,000 was financed by BISM.
BISM has established mechanisms to evaluate the success of its
rehabilitation and training programs but those processes should be expanded
to include all such services. The surveys that were conducted by BISM for
certain program services indicated that participants had achieved successful
outcomes and were satisfied with the services provided.
Pricing Policies and Practices for BISM Supplies and Services
The independent pricing committees established by State law to set the fair
market prices of BISM supplies (products) and services available to State
agencies have not performed a comprehensive review of the BISM supplies
and services prices. Consequently, there is a lack of assurance that BISM’s
price for each of its supplies and services, which generally State agencies
must buy under a mandated procurement preference, reflect the fair market
price. Rather, the prices charged to State agencies for hundreds of products,
have been those recommended by BISM.
Based on price surveys we conducted, on an overall basis, BISM prices for 14
products typically purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015 were
competitive with the prices for similar competitor products offered for sale on
the Internet. For example, our comparison of the average BISM unit prices
paid by the State during fiscal year 2015 to the average Internet prices
offered by vendors disclosed that 12 of the 14 products were priced lower by
BISM.
Regarding the products that BISM offered to the State under the procurement
preference, BISM did not maintain records to demonstrate that direct blind
labor hours constituted at least 75 percent of the total manufacturing hours
for each product. Based on legal advice we sought, counsel to the General
Assembly reaffirmed a 1993 Attorney General’s Opinion that concluded that
only products meeting that blind labor hour threshold qualify for the State
procurement preference. BISM disagrees with that conclusion based on a
1995 Baltimore City Circuit Court judgment that concluded, with respect to
the applicable provisions of State law, BISM was deemed to be a State agency
and, therefore, the requirement does not apply to BISM. Since the 1995
ruling, BISM has relocated to Baltimore County. According to legal counsel, if
the matter is again raised before the court in another jurisdiction (such as
6

--- Page 9 ---
Baltimore County), a different decision could be reached regarding whether
BISM is required to comply with the blind labor threshold.
Executive Compensation Processes
The processes for setting compensation for the chief executive officer (CEO)
and other management personnel were not comprehensive. The annual
performance evaluations, the results of which were integral for annual salary
adjustments for those individuals, did not include an assessment as to
whether organizational and/or position goals were achieved.
Comparison compensation data was annually obtained for the CEO position,
however, such information was not obtained to ensure the compensation for
other management positions was reasonable. Based on an analysis we
performed comparing CEO compensation and gross receipts, the BISM CEO’s
salary (including bonus) of $472,500 was comparable to the compensation
paid to CEOs of three other similarly-sized blind industries organizations. The
compensation paid to three other management personnel we reviewed also
appeared reasonable.
Although approximately one-half of the CEO’s compensation represented a
bonus, BISM’s CEO Performance Bonus Program had not been defined.
BISM’s Board Chairman advised that the bonus was a mechanism for bridging
the difference between the BISM’s CEO’s base salary and the compensation
paid to peer CEOs.
Finally, BISM had established a comprehensive code of ethics and
appropriate financial disclosure requirements and compliance with the policy
was properly monitored.

Background Information
BISM Overview
Blind Industries and Services of Maryland (BISM), an Internal Revenue Code
501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization, was established in 1908 as Maryland
Workshop for the Blind by the General Assembly to provide vocational
rehabilitation, continuous employment, and other resources to blind adults of
Maryland. Facilities were added in 1955 and 1969 to serve the needs of the
blind in Western Maryland (Cumberland) and the Eastern Shore (Salisbury). In
1973, Maryland Workshop for the Blind was renamed by legislation as Blind
Industries and Services of Maryland.
Since the early 1990’s, BISM has participated in a federal nationwide
program where the federal government buys products and services from
community-based non-profit agencies, dedicated to training and employing
people who are blind or have significant disabilities. Under the program BISM
has been awarded textile contracts to produce garments, including uniforms
for the branches of the military, operating textile manufacturing facilities in
Baltimore County, Cumberland, and Salisbury. Subsequently, BISM expanded
its textile operations by purchasing a plant in North Carolina (also employing
the blind). The textile work at BISM’s Maryland locations are assisted by the
work performed by a separate non-profit charitable organization (Maryland
Manufacturing Services, Inc. or MMS) incorporated in Maryland for that
purpose. In 1997, BISM expanded its participation in the program to the
operation of base supply stores at a number of sales locations on federal
property in several states (including Maryland) and the District of Columbia.
Under State law, BISM has been granted a procurement preference for sales
to State agencies. The preference mandates that a State or State aided or
controlled entity shall buy supplies and services from BISM if BISM provides
the services and supplies and the Maryland Correctional Enterprises (MCE)
does not (MCE has primacy over BISM in State law regarding procurements by
State agencies). There is also a law provision that for a State contract award
that includes housekeeping or janitorial services, the prime contractor or its
subcontractors must procure janitorial products from BISM if the specified
products are available.
During fiscal year 2015, the annual sales from the federal-related operations
totaled $67.6 million, sales to State agencies and contractors totaled $10.5
million and sales to other private entities totaled $6.0 million. Based on
BISM’s fiscal year 2015 audited financial statements, revenue ($85.1 million)
9

--- Page 12 ---
exceeded expenses ($84.7 million) resulting in an excess of operating
revenue over expenses totaling $343,000. However, after factoring in other
revenue and expenses, such as a loss on investments and interest expense,
there was a negative $483,784 change in net assets (a loss). As of June 30,
2015, BISM’s unrestricted assets totaled $18.6 million, the majority of which
consisted of property, plant, and equipment.
Governance Structure
BISM is governed by an 11 member Board of Trustees, of whom at least 4
shall be blind, appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the
Senate. Each Board member serves a 3-year term, and the terms are
staggered amongst the members. According to State law, the Board shall:
1. maintain in Baltimore City a training and employment center for blind
individuals;
2. operate BISM for the labor and manufactures of all blind adult
residents of the State who give satisfactory evidence of character and
ability to do the work required;
3. use the profits arising from the operation of BISM to further its
mission;
4. acquire suitable quarters in the State;
5. keep proper records of its funds and accounts; and
6. report annually to the Governor, the General Assembly, and the chair of
the Joint Audit Committee on the condition and operations of BISM,
including a thorough discussion of its programs and the participation
of the blind community in these programs.
To assist the Board in its duties and provide for the daily operation of BISM,
there is a senior management team, under the leadership of the BISM
President (chief executive officer). The President, who reports to the Board’s
Chairperson, serves at the Board’s pleasure under a four-year employment
contract that specifies the duties and compensation of the President,
including a base salary, bonus program, fringe benefits, and vacation and
holiday leave. The current contractual duties of the President include the
“ultimate responsibility for managing the business and affairs of BISM,”
serving as principal spokesperson for BISM, seeking out and developing
strategies to strengthen BISM, preparing an annual budget, and “in keeping
with BISM’s mission, implement tactics and programs to accomplish BISM’s
objectives.”
10

--- Page 13 ---
BISM’s senior management team includes a Chief Operating Officer, Chief
Accounting Officer, a Vice-President of Sales and Marketing, Director of
Manufacturing, and a Director of Rehabilitation. These management
positions report to the President, and each employee’s employment
compensation is set by the President.
Overview of Operations
BISM’s mission is “to provide stable career opportunities, innovative
rehabilitation programs, quality products and services, and to develop
resources for training and education.” Accordingly, BISM’s primary
operational activities focus on:
 sales to State agencies;
 sales to federal agencies and retail sales to individuals at federal
installations; and
 rehabilitation and training to blind individuals in Maryland.
Products offered for sale to State agencies include: paper pads, hand soaps,
sanitizers, janitorial chemicals, floor care products, medical exam gloves, can
liners, toilet paper, paper towels, chemicals for cleaning kitchen ware and
cutlery, bleach, and personal care products. BISM sales to State agencies
also includes custom labeled pint and five-gallon purified bottled water.
The federal sales relate primarily to the manufacture and sale of military
clothing and the retail operation of eight base supply centers located on
federal installations under the federal AbilityOne Program. The textile
operation has been providing uniforms and other fabric products to the US
military since the early 1990’s. (This function is also performed by 27 other
blind organizations nationwide.) The base supply centers sell office supplies,
cleaning products, tools, and uniforms to base customers; however, the items
for sale are not necessarily manufactured or produced by BISM. (Base supply
centers are also operated by 17 other blind organizations nationwide.)
BISM also provides rehabilitation and training to the blind in Maryland. The
purpose is to provide blind and visually impaired individuals with the
knowledge and skills that they need to live independent lives. These services
are provided at no cost to the participants at various locations throughout
Maryland. The cost of the services is partially funded by the Maryland State
Department of Education’s (MSDE) Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS)
with the remaining costs funded by BISM.

BISM Overall Sales Activity and Workforce Data
Sales from operations accounted for over 98 percent of total BISM revenue
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (Table 1 lists BISM’s fiscal year
2015 sales by source). Remaining revenues consist of a MSDE grant of
approximately $531,000, MSDE fee-for-service payments of $295,000, and
miscellaneous revenues and other grants of approximately $365,000.

* Includes sales to State agencies and State contractors under BISM’s procurement
preference totaling $10,482,399, with the remainder of the sales to private entities.
The majority (80 percent) of its fiscal year 2015 sales was derived from two
sources related to its business associations with the federal government – its
textile operations (with related manufacturing facilities in Cumberland,
Baltimore County, Salisbury, and Raleigh, North Carolina) and its retail
operations at base supply centers located at federal installations in Maryland,
as well as other states and the District of Columbia. Sales to State agencies
of goods manufactured or produced at its Baltimore County facility accounted
for 12.5 percent of sales and the remaining (7.5 percent) was sold to other
private entities. The portion of federal to State sales activity has been
relatively consistent over the five year period ended June 30, 2015.
BISM’s operations (including sales, manufacturing, administration,
rehabilitation, and training) are staffed by both blind and sighted employees.
As of June 30, 2015, BISM provided employment for 578 individuals (referred
to as associates) of whom 37 percent were blind. This included 130 sighted
MMS employees. Table 2 presents agency-wide employment data, broken
down between blind and sighted employees for fiscal years 2011 to 2015. As
shown in the table, the percent of blind employees has remained between 36
and 40 percent during those years.

Regarding employment of the blind, BISM records indicate that all blind
employees make above the minimum wage, plus receive fringe benefits (for
example, health insurance and paid vacations).
Baltimore Plant Sales to State Agencies
Products Offered
According to BISM management, the products selected for selling to State
agencies consider marketability, profitability, and suitability for blind
employment. According to BISM’s website catalogue, it offers over 400
products to State agencies, which are also purchased by State contractors.1
The prime manufacturing, production, and warehousing operation for the
products offered for sale to State agencies is located in Baltimore County,
along with its headquarters offices. There are, however, some functions
related to the manufacture of fabric products for the federal government also
performed at that location.
The products sold to the State can be categorized by three types of processing
methodologies utilized by BISM, which are described below with fiscal year
2015 State agency sales for each category.
 Warehoused products are items that are purchased in bulk quantities, but
pre-packaged by the third party manufacturer in small resalable units, that
1 These products are also sold to private entities with fiscal year 2015 sales totaling
approximately $6 million.
13

--- Page 16 ---
are stored in the BISM warehouse and sold to the State agency in
quantities that meet the agency’s requirements (sales of $5.9 million).
 Manufactured or assembled products are those items that start with a raw
material and have some type of operation performed to transform it into a
usable finished product, such as concentrated cleaning chemicals that are
diluted and packaged into consumer usable strengths (sales of $2.5
million).
 Repackaged products are those items that are purchased in bulk, but that
are packaged by BISM employees into smaller user friendly quantities. For
example, rolls of trash liners are purchased in bulk and are packaged into
boxes containing a specified number of rolls for sale (sales of $2.1
million). Also included in this category, is the assembly of “kits,” for
certain customers which represent an assortment of different items
placed into one package.
BISM management advised us that it continuously attempts to identify
vendors that will sell products to them in a bulk form for repacking purposes.
BISM attributes two benefits to this process: (1) products can be purchased at
a lower cost, which it can pass along to the State; and (2) repackaging tasks
can be readily performed by blind individuals. BISM has a significant number
of products on the State preference list that represent repackaging of bulk
purchases into smaller units for sale.
Product Pricing
Generally, for each new product brought to market, a four-step process is
applied. First, BISM determines if a product is marketable and adaptable to
blind labor, if appropriate supplies are available, and that there are no legal
barriers. If all three conditions are satisfied, during the next step a product
manufacturing, assembly, packaging, or distribution process is developed. As
a third step, BISM conducts a cost analysis of the product and the amount of
blind labor required to produce a finished product is measured. For the final
step, a fair market price study is performed and BISM decides if the product
can be offered for sale at a competitive price. If the product is to be offered
for sale to State agencies under BISM’s preference, the proposed pricing of
the product is submitted to the Pricing Committee for consideration.
Prices for the BISM items offered for sale under the preference are to be set
by a pricing committee established by State law. Prior to July 1, 2015, the
BISM Pricing Committee consisted of designees from the Secretary of General
Services, the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the
President of BISM, and a Board member of the National Federation of the
14

--- Page 17 ---
Blind of Maryland. Applicable State regulations required the Committee, with
the assistance of the staff of BISM, to meet at least annually to set prices that
reflect the current average market prices for the supplies and services BISM
provides to State agencies.
Effective July 1, 2015, State law established a successor committee named
the Pricing and Selection Committee for Blind Industries and Services of
Maryland and the Employment Works Program. The Committee consists of
five Maryland officials (or their designee); the Secretaries of: Transportation;
General Services; Public Safety and Correctional Services; and Labor,
Licensing, and Regulation; plus the Assistant Secretary of Vocational
Rehabilitation within MSDE. The Committee is to ensure that supplies and
services provided by BISM create work opportunities for individuals, which
BISM was established to assist, and set the fair market prices of supplies and
services that BISM provides under preference to State agencies. The
Committee is also responsible for maintaining a current list of supplies and
services that BISM provides, periodically reviewing and revising the list, and
sending the list to the Secretary of the Department of General Services who
shall make the lists available to State agencies.
Federal Manufacturing Sales and Retail Operations
BISM operates a textile manufacturing plant in Raleigh, North Carolina, whose
output solely relates to BISM’s federal contract sales for US military clothing.
In addition, BISM’s facilities in Cumberland and Salisbury, Maryland perform
textile manufacturing work for the federal government, and to some extent, so
does the Baltimore County plant.
The textile work at these Maryland locations is assisted by the work performed
under a separate non-profit charitable organization incorporated in Maryland.
This organization is Maryland Manufacturing Services, Inc (MMS) and is
headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland. This entity was created to enable BISM
to use sighted individuals to perform certain tasks (sewing) that could not be
performed by blind persons, while allowing BISM to still meet federal
requirements related to blind labor participation rates for products sold to
federal agencies. That is, individuals employed by MMS are not blind, but
because it is a separate entity, the work of those individuals does not affect
the labor participation rate for the applicable products for federal purposes.
BISM provides administrative support for MMS. This support includes
maintaining the payroll records for MMS employees which are not on BISM’s
payroll. MMS operations provide employment and training to economically
15

--- Page 18 ---
disadvantaged and under-employed residents of Salisbury and Cumberland,
where they work side-by-side with BISM employees.
Through the federal AbilityOne Program, BISM operates five supply centers or
stores on military installations and in federal buildings, located in Delaware,
Virginia, Kentucky, and the District of Columbia. In addition, three centers or
stores are operated in Maryland.
Rehabilitation and Training Programs
Services Provided and Funding
BISM’s Rehabilitation Division serves the blind and visually-impaired in
Maryland by providing them with life skills training that will lead to self-
reliance and independence. As of June 30, 2015, the Division had a staff of
27 persons. The Division provides rehabilitation and training at locations
throughout Maryland. Total rehabilitation and training expenditures for fiscal
year 2015 were $1,579,533 of which $876,402 was funded by MSDE’s
Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) and $703,131 was financed by
BISM.
Generally, the blind and visually-impaired in need of training and employment
are referred to BISM by DORS. Under federal regulations, DORS is the
designated State agency responsible for conducting outreach efforts intended
to ensure blind persons know where to apply for rehabilitation services and to
identify possible employment opportunities. Consequently, DORS acts as a
gatekeeper qualifying individuals for services and deciding to which service
provider they will be sent.
All participants in BISM rehabilitation and training programs are referred by
DORS and the two parties enter into multi-year cooperative agreements to
govern this referral process, the most recent agreement at the time of our
audit covered the period of June 2012 to June 2015. Under the cooperative
agreement, BISM performs certain evaluation and training services, as well as
receives reimbursement for certain residential housing costs for individuals
participating in the Comprehensive Orientation, Rehabilitation, and
Empowerment (CORE) program.
The CORE program is an intensive residential program that enables students
to acquire diverse skills that can be applied at home, in school, and on the
job. The senior programs are for individuals who are 55 years of age and
older that are blind or have low vision. The skills taught are similar to the
CORE program but are delivered on a less intensive, non-residential basis.
16

--- Page 19 ---
BISM also provides limited in-home training to meet the needs of those who
wish to remain in their home environment. These programs are partially
funded by DORS through an annual grant agreement and a separate fee for
service arrangement under the cooperative agreement. During fiscal year
2015, BISM expended $1,374,649 to provide the CORE program (including
residential housing costs), senior programs, and in-home training. BISM
received a grant from DORS of $531,115 to partially fund the CORE and
senior programs, plus an additional $50,000 Independent Living Older Blind
(ILOB) grant for seniors. BISM also received $267,587 from DORS as
reimbursements under the cooperative agreement fee for service
arrangement. The remaining expenses of these programs totaling $525,947
were financed by BISM.
BISM also offers two youth programs – a three-week residential program for
middle school students and a seven-week residential program for high school
students – that provide independent skills development, confidence building
activities, and residential living experiences. During fiscal year 2015, BISM
expended $204,884 on these programs. BISM received $27,700 from DORS
as reimbursements under the cooperative agreement fee for service
arrangement and the remaining expenses of $177,184 were financed by
BISM.

Relationship with the Maryland School for the Blind
The Maryland School for the Blind (MSB) is a private, statewide resource
center that assists local school systems and families by providing outreach,
educational, and residential programs to children and youth from infancy to
age 21 who are blind or visually impaired including those with multiple
disabilities. The students that attend MSB are a different population than
those who participate in BISM programs. MSB students also typically have
other disabilities in addition to blindness. Students must be referred for
placement in the MSB program through their local school’s Individualized
Education Program team. BISM only begins accepting students, into their
youth program, after they have entered the fifth grade (approximately 11-12
years old). MSB has collaborated with staff from BISM and DORS over the
years to jointly offer and provide various after-school/weekend skill-building
sessions for students on topics such as social skills and daily living skills.
BISM In-State and Out-of-State Employment and Sales Data
Maryland Operations
BISM’s Maryland operations in Cumberland, Baltimore County, and two
locations in Salisbury, as well as its Maryland rehabilitation and training
division, collectively employed 380 of the 578 total employees (including the
MMS workforce) as of June 30, 2015, see Table 5. Of the 380 employees,
132 or 35 percent were blind and employed directly by BISM, and of the 248
sighted employees, MMS accounted for 130 (MMS’s workforce is sighted).
Table 6 presents BISM-only Maryland employment and shows that a slight
majority of BISM’s Maryland workforce is blind.

The Baltimore County plant operations supplies janitorial and sanitation
products, paper products, and beverage products (bottled water). It also
includes a textile cutting operation which is included in the summary of
Maryland textile-related operations below. The Baltimore location also houses
BISM’s administrative personnel. The Baltimore plant location employed 120
employees at the end of fiscal year 2015 (69 sighted and 51 blind), and
contributed $16.4 million in sales.

The work performed at the Cumberland and Salisbury locations relate to
BISM’s federal textile contract work. BISM’s textile-related operations in
Maryland employed 240 employees (including MMS) at the end of fiscal year
2015 (169 sighted and 71 blind), and contributed to $32.3 million in sales.
Finally, BISM operates three AbilityOne stores or supply centers in Maryland
on military installations or federal buildings, which as of the end of fiscal year
2015, employed 20 individuals (10 sighted and 10 blind or visually impaired),
including 1 sighted non-resident employee, and had $5.1 million in sales.
Out-of-State Operations
As of June 30, 2015, BISM’s out-of-State operations at its textile
manufacturing plant in Raleigh, North Carolina and the five AbilityOne stores
employed 198 individuals. Table 7 presents the number of individuals
employed in BISM’s out-of-State operations, broken down by sighted and blind
employees. The majority of employees are sighted.

As of June 30, 2015, the textile manufacturing plant employed 157
individuals (85 sighted and 72 blind). Fiscal year 2015 sales for the clothing
manufactured at that location totaled $14.8 million.
BISM’s five AbilityOne stores in other states employed 41 employees (29
sighted and 12 blind) as June 30, 2015. Those locations accounted for fiscal
year 2015 sales of $15.4 million.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Audit Scope
We conducted a performance audit of certain operational aspects of the Blind
Industries and Services of Maryland (BISM). The scope of the audit included
an evaluation of BISM's employment and training strategies, pricing policies
and practices for supplies and services sold to State agencies, and executive
compensation processes. The audit was conducted at the direction of the
General Assembly’s Joint Audit Committee.
Our audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe
that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Objectives and Methodology
Our audit had three objectives:
1. To determine whether BISM has established employment and training
strategies that promote work, career and training opportunities, and
services for blind and visually-impaired persons in Maryland;
2. To determine whether pricing policies and practices provide assurance
that Maryland State agencies are paying the fair market prices for BISM-
produced supplies and services; and
3. To determine whether BISM has established reasonable processes and
standards for setting executive compensation and appropriate ethics
requirements for BISM management and board members.
To accomplish our objectives, we reviewed applicable State laws, and the
policies and procedures established by BISM, governing their business
operations and training, rehabilitation, and education programs, as well as the
terms of applicable State grant agreements. We interviewed personnel at
BISM, the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), the Maryland
Department of General Services, selected county government agencies, our
legal counsel to the General Assembly (see below), and certain BISM sales
customers. We inspected BISM and certain related State documents and
21

--- Page 24 ---
records, and observed BISM business operations and management and
oversight of its training, rehabilitation, and education programs. Our test
work, as described below, primarily covered BISM’s activities for fiscal year
2015.
We conducted tests, using BISM Rehabilitation Division records, to verify the
accuracy of program participation totals included in budget documents and
annual reports submitted to the State. We also verified compliance with
MSDE grant agreement requirements related to those programs funded in
part by State grants.
We conducted tests, using BISM product pricing, manufacturing, and sales
records, to assess the effectiveness of product pricing processes and
appropriateness of production methodologies, and analyze sales trends. We
also conducted fair market product pricing research via the Internet for 14 of
the highest selling products purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015,
and reviewed certain procurement activity related to BISM products of a State
university.
Additionally, we contacted certain Maryland State agencies and local school
systems and attempted to determine the prices they paid for any items
purchased similar to the 14 products we tested. However, our review was
inconclusive as it disclosed that none of them had purchased more than a few
of the items and the prices paid varied greatly depending on the purchasing
methodology used, with the lowest prices being obtained through a
competitive solicitation process.
We conducted tests, using BISM payroll and personnel records, to verify the
existence and proper classification of employees as to blind or sighted and
performed certain employment-related analytical procedures. We also
reviewed certain employee compensation levels, using available public
records of executive compensation reported by other blind organizations with
similar manufacturing operations, sales levels, and training and education
programs. Finally, we reviewed BISM’s employee ethics policy and tested the
related employee reporting process.
Generally, transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgment,
which primarily considers risk. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, neither
statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was used to select the
transactions tested. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, the results of the
tests cannot be used to project those results to the entire population from
which the test items were selected.
22

--- Page 25 ---
Our audit did not include a review of State agency compliance with State
procurement preference statutes that require that certain products be
purchased from BISM. Additionally, although BISM receives referrals of
visually impaired persons from the MSDE Division of Rehabilitative Services
(DORS), we did not review DORS outreach or referral procedures.
Advice of Counsel Requested to Interpret Governing Laws
In addition to review and tests of BISM records and surveys of other entities, a
key component of our audit methodology in addressing our three objectives,
was obtaining advice of counsel from the Office of the Attorney General. We
sought formal advice from counsel to the Maryland General Assembly
regarding the applicability of certain laws and to clarify the intent of existing
State law governing BISM and its operation. Our preliminary review raised
three basic questions to which we received the answers below. Certain
aspects of the advice received are discussed elsewhere in this report and
incorporated into our findings.
1. Is it legal for BISM to own or operate manufacturing and retail businesses
located in other states and employ and train blind persons who are not
Maryland residents?
BISM has broad authority under the law to further its mission of
providing training and employment opportunities for the blind.
Previous legal opinions had concluded that BISM was a quasi-
governmental entity that could operate like a private entity. BISM
could purchase and own investments and properties regardless of
where located and could legally operate businesses outside of
Maryland and employ and train blind persons who were not Maryland
residents.
We were also advised that the establishment of a separate entity, the
Maryland Manufacturing Services, Inc. (MMS), with respect to BISM’s
federal manufacturing activities was permissible.
2. Do all BISM products have to be manufactured or assembled using 75
percent blind direct labor, and can BISM sell items purchased in bulk that
are distributed in retail sizes?
In general, in order to receive the procurement preference in the State
Finance and Procurement Article, the goods must meet the 75 percent
direct labor requirement. The 75 percent direct labor requirement does
not, however, apply to janitorial products which are covered by a
separate provision in the State Finance and Procurement Article which
23

--- Page 26 ---
was added in 2013. The Attorney General has advised that BISM does
not have to manufacture or assemble all of its products. For example,
in a 1993 Opinion, the Attorney General opined that the statute did not
require that BISM manufacture the products sold in its vending
machines, so long as 75 percent of the work force for vending machine
services consists of blind individuals. For similar reasons, BISM may
buy products in bulk and repackage them for sale at retail, so long as
the operation meets the 75 percent requirement. It is clear, however,
that there must be some level of reprocessing, and that BISM cannot
simply procure goods and resell them without some intermediate step.
3. Do existing laws clearly delineate current BISM business practices and
adequately consider current employment and business circumstances?
The existing laws are open to interpretation. The Attorney General
noted in his 1993 Opinion that the plain meaning of the language
would mean that BISM could never be a distributor of brand-name
merchandise or provide other such services. The Opinion concluded,
however, that such a limited interpretation would not be in accordance
with the intent of the legislature as reflected in other provisions of the
law. As a result, the Opinion interpreted the statute to permit BISM to
produce both tangible items and services (operation of vending
machines selling national brands qualifies for procurement
preference). There are limits, however to the ability to read the
language broadly to cover additional employment and training
opportunities. The definition of "direct labor hours" in the Commercial
Law Article expressly excludes time spent on administration,
supervision, shipping, and product inspection, and thus products and
services where blind people predominantly serve in these roles do not
qualify for the procurement preference. This limitation makes sense in
the context of the use of the label "product made by the blind," but it
may no longer reflect the range of employment and training that BISM
can make available for the blind.
This advice, however, did not consider a 1995 Baltimore City Circuit Court
case involving BISM, which led to a court conclusion that BISM is a State
agency and as such is not subject to the 75 percent blind direct labor
requirements discussed above. This matter is further discussed in finding
2.3.

Fieldwork and Agency Response
Our fieldwork was completed during the period from April 2015 through
December 2015. A copy of the draft report was provided to BISM, and Finding
2.3 was provided to the Department of General Services (DGS) and an official
of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), representing the
Pricing and Selection Committee for Blind Industries and Services of Maryland
and the Employment Works Program. BISM’s responses to our findings and
recommendations, and the responses from DGS and the Committee to
Finding 2.3, appear as an appendix to this report. Since the detailed
responses to Recommendation 2.3 from DGS and the Committee were
identical, only one version was included in the appendix. As prescribed in
State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we will advise the parties regarding the results of our review of their
responses, as appropriate.

Findings and Recommendations
Objective 1
Blind Industries and Services of Maryland (BISM) Strategies to
Promote Work, Career, and Training Opportunities, and Services
for Blind and Visually-Impaired Persons in Maryland
Finding 1.1
Until September 2015, BISM had not formally adopted strategies to
accomplish organizational goals it established in 2013. Also, BISM has not
taken the next step of developing action plans or measures to assess the
success of those efforts.
Analysis
Until September 2015, BISM had not formally adopted strategies to
accomplish organizational goals it established in 2013. Also, BISM has not
taken the next step of developing action plans or measures to assess the
success of those efforts.
In March 2013, BISM established overall organization goals for 2020 which
included increasing sales to $250 million annually, employing over 750
associates, hiring more blind associates, and continuing to expand
rehabilitation services. The strategies that were recently adopted to address
the organizational goals are classified into four initiative areas: employment
growth and associate satisfaction; rehabilitation services growth; reputation
and visibility enhancement; and financial strength. BISM has not identified
the actionable steps necessary to address the strategies identified under
each of the four initiatives, nor the related measures to enable an evaluation
as to whether those steps are yielding the desired results.
For example, regarding employment growth and associate satisfaction, BISM
has identified nine strategies, such as to grow blind jobs by double digits every
five years, and to diversify into services and expand commercial product
sales, but has not developed the steps for carrying out the strategies. For
example, to expand commercial product sales and blind employment
opportunities, BISM may choose to market new products. To do so, BISM
would need to outline the steps and those responsible for identifying new
products and potential consumers, the related labor pool requirements and
establish measures (such as sales goals, products introduced) to assess
progress.
27

--- Page 30 ---
Regarding rehabilitation services growth, BISM has identified seven
strategies, such as to expand/enhance community outreach efforts. BISM
needs to identify the steps that should be taken to identify the targeted
community groups or individuals, the types of outreach to be performed, and
the measures to assess whether those outreach efforts are successful.
Action plans are essential if BISM hopes to achieve its 2020 goals, especially
the goal of increasing sales to $250 million, which equates to approximately
tripling its current annual sales activity. This goal seems very ambitious
considering that for the five-year period ended fiscal year 2015, sales have
only grown by approximately nine percent, and since 2013 sales have actually
declined.
BISM’s employment goal of 750 individuals by 2020, which excludes
Maryland Manufacturing Services, Inc. (MMS) employees, appears
questionable. Over the same five-year period employment has increased by
57 percent to 448 persons (sighted and blind), with most of this occurring
since 2013, but to attain the desired employment gain would require an
increase of 67 percent over the next five years. BISM’s goal of double-digit
increases in blind employment every five years may be reasonable in that over
the five-year period ended June 30 2015, blind employment increased 43
percent, all of which occurred during fiscal year 2015 at locations outside of
Maryland. BISM recently advised that it is unaware of any blind individuals
locally who need employment.
Recommendation 1.1
We recommend that BISM
a. develop action plans for its strategic initiatives identifying steps to be
taken, those individuals responsible for completing the tasks and related
timeframes;
b. develop performance measures to assess whether the actions taken are
achieving desired results; and
c. conduct ongoing monitoring of plans and outcomes.
Finding 1.2
BISM conducts outreach programs to inform Maryland residents of available
services. The needs of blind individuals requesting services appear to be met.
Analysis
BISM conducts outreach programs using various communication methods to
inform Maryland residents of its rehabilitation, training, and education
services. Our contact with representatives of Maryland State Department of
28

--- Page 31 ---
Education (MSDE) Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) and selected
county health and human services agencies did not identify any individuals
who have requested services BISM offers that have not been served.
BISM’s Rehabilitation Division offers programs and services that provide
comprehensive blindness education and training for adults, seniors, and
youth, which are offered at no cost to qualifying Maryland residents.
Individuals are qualified to participate in BISM’s programs by DORS, which
acts as the gatekeeper for services to the blind and others with certain
disabilities, in accordance with federal regulations. BISM uses newspaper,
radio, and television advertising to promote the availability of its programs
and services, although interested individuals who contact BISM directly are
referred to DORS, which determines those individuals who can participate in
BISM programs.
According to BISM’s records, during fiscal year 2015, BISM provided a total of
71,462 hours of blindness skills education and training through its
Comprehensive Orientation, Rehabilitation, and Empowerment (CORE), senior
services, youth and in-home programs. We determined that, collectively,
these programs were held in 20 of the 24 Maryland subdivisions between
fiscal years 2012 and 2014. We were advised by BISM that even though a
program was not provided in four subdivisions, visually impaired residents of
those subdivisions may and do receive services at a location in an adjoining
subdivision.
Also, we contacted several county health and social services departments to
determine if they had received any unmet requests for services from blind
individuals. They advised us that they generally do not receive such requests
or that they refer such individuals to DORS, as required, for placement.
Finally, DORS’ officials advised us that they were unaware of any unmet
requests from blind individuals for BISM services and there was no waiting list
for blind individuals DORS had referred to BISM.
Recommendation 1.2
No recommendation required
29

--- Page 32 ---
Finding 1.3
BISM has assumed more financial responsibility over its various rehabilitation
and training programs offered to blind individuals.
Analysis
The Maryland General Assembly expressed an intent in the fiscal year 1998
budget bill language that BISM move to self-sufficiency so that State
contributions could be reduced beginning in fiscal year 2000. BISM has
made some strides toward self-sufficiency but has not achieved this objective.
However since the 2006 session of the General Assembly there has been no
mention of this issue in the budget bill analyses. Further, we contacted staff
at the Department of Legislative Services’ Office of Policy Analysis who
confirmed that at present, there is no indication that the issue of self-
sufficiency is a continuing concern to the budget committees.
Annual State grant awards to BISM declined from a high of $1.9 million for
fiscal year 1998 to a low of approximately $531,000 for fiscal years 2012 to
2015. In addition to the annual grant awarded, BISM received from DORS
fee-for-service reimbursements totaling approximately $295,000 and another
$50,000 grant during fiscal year 2015. In total, funds received from DORS
during fiscal year 2015 totaled approximately $876,000. BISM’s total
rehabilitation and training expenditures for that year were $1,579,533.
Exhibit 2 contains a graph comparing the total BISM sales, total rehabilitation
and training expenses, and the State support provided to BISM (grants plus
fee-for-service reimbursements) for those expenses from fiscal year 1998
through fiscal year 2015.
Our review of fiscal year 2015 activity under the annual DORS grant disclosed
that the grant funds were used for the benefit of blind Maryland residents.
BISM used the entirety of its fiscal year 2015 State grant from DORS to fund
its CORE Program and a senior services program. The DORS grant is not
intended to fully fund the rehabilitation and training program, but rather to
supplement the CORE and senior programs. We noted that 24 of the 27 fiscal
year 2015 participants in the CORE program were blind Maryland residents
(88 percent), whereas the DORS funded portion of program expenses
(including expenses covered under the cooperative agreement) totaled
approximately 80 percent.
The fiscal year 2015 DORS annual grant for the CORE and senior programs
required BISM to provide a minimum of 45,540 training hours. For fiscal year
2015, BISM reported that it provided 60,731 training hours for CORE and
senior services. We performed certain analyses of program attendance
30

--- Page 33 ---
records and believe that BISM’s reported number of training hours actually
provided is reasonable.
Recommendation 1.3
No recommendation required
Finding 1.4
Many former CORE students completing the program have reported achieving
successful post-training outcomes, but BISM has not established a process
for tracking student satisfaction with some of its services.
Analysis
Many former BISM students completing the CORE program have reported
achieving successful post-training outcomes. BISM considers finding a job,
going on to higher education, or being able to live independently as a
successful outcome. However, BISM has not established a process for
tracking student satisfaction with some of its services.
Although BISM is not responsible for employment placement services under
their agreement with DORS, it does perform follow-up contacts with former
students. According to BISM, many former BISM students completing the
CORE program have reported successful outcomes. For example, of the 11
students who completed the BISM CORE program in fiscal year 2015, 3
obtained employment with BISM, 2 obtained employment with private
companies, and 4 are currently enrolled in college/vocational school. See
Table 8 for CORE program student outcomes for the years 2011 to 2015.

* The CORE program is a rolling program that does not have fixed starting and ending dates
for participants. The outcomes are as of each fiscal year-end. For example, of the 27
participants in fiscal year 2015, 11 had completed the program during the year, 12 were
still actively in the program at fiscal year-end, 3 withdrew voluntarily, and 1 was terminated
for cause.
In addition, BISM surveys past CORE program participants and participants in
some senior programs regarding their satisfaction with the level of service
provided by BISM. Survey questions include those designed to measure
BISM’s success in helping participants, such as achieving their goals,
increasing their ability to function in society, learning new information and
skills, plus instructor effectiveness. Our review of the results of the past three
years of participant surveys (fiscal years 2013 to 2015), disclosed that
average customer satisfaction exceeded 90 percent in each case.
BISM also surveys participants of its summer youth programs through an
Internet survey tool. The survey requests respondents to provide written
comments answering 15 questions, such as, which class was the most
challenging, which seminar was the most significant to you, and how are you
now more confident. However, BISM does not survey participants of its in-
home training, workshops, or one day programs to assess its performance
and measure client satisfaction.
Recommendation 1.4
We recommend that BISM establish a formal process for determining and
tracking student/client satisfaction for all its training and rehabilitation
services.
Objective 2
BISM Pricing Policies and Practices for Supplies and Services Sold
to Maryland State Agencies
Finding 2.1
Pricing committees established by State law had not conducted a
comprehensive review of the prices of BISM’s supplies and services available
for sale to State agencies.
Analysis
The independent pricing committees responsible for determining the fair
market prices of BISM supplies (products) and services offered under the
State procurement preference have not performed a comprehensive price
review of all such BISM supplies and services. Rather, the price charged
32

--- Page 35 ---
State agencies and posted on BISM’s website for hundreds of products, has
been set by BISM without any formal oversight or approval from the
committee. Consequently, there is no assurance that BISM prices reflect the
fair market prices of the supplies and services offered to State agencies, as
required by law.
Prior to July 1, 2015, State law established a BISM Pricing Committee that
consisted of designees from the Secretary of General Services (DGS), the
Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), the President of
BISM, and a Board member of the National Federation of the Blind of
Maryland (NFB). Applicable State regulations required the Committee, with
the assistance of the staff of BISM, to meet at least annually to set prices that
reflect the fair market prices for the supplies and services BISM provides to
State agencies.
An OLA audit report on the DGS Office of Procurement and Logistics issued in
November 2013 found that the Committee had not determined and published
the fair market prices of BISM supplies and services as required and, as of
October 2013, had not met since July 2012.
During the course of this audit, we obtained and reviewed Committee records
for calendar years 2014 and 20152 and found that the Committee did not
evaluate the fair market prices of all products and services included on the
product master list on BISM’s website that it offers for sale to the State. We
were advised by BISM that for that period, the Committee reviewed the prices
for new BISM products and evaluated the fair market prices. However, due to
a lack of documentation from the Committee and BISM, we were unable to
determine how many of the 415 products sold to the State by BISM in fiscal
year 2015 were subjected to the Committee’s review and approval. According
to a Committee representative, it did not conduct independent research for
any BISM products, instead relying solely on the pricing information provided
by BISM.
Our review found that BISM’s pricing research was not always adequately
documented and BISM had not established a policy on how long to retain
such research. BISM only began retaining documentation of its product fair
market pricing research beginning in October 2014. Based on our review of
this documentation BISM conducted research on comparable products using
the internet (OLA used a similar approach in testing product prices in Finding
2.2).
2 The Committee met three times during that period in January and October 2014, and in
June 2015. The Committee did not meet in calendar year 2013.
33

--- Page 36 ---
Furthermore, DGS management advised that as of October 15, 2015, the new
pricing committee that was created as a result of legislation that passed
during the 2015 Session of the Maryland General Assembly effective July 1,
2015 had not yet met to set the prices for BISM supplies and services. Also,
DGS has not made a price list available to State agencies. This committee,
named the Pricing and Selection Committee for Blind Industries and Services
of Maryland and the Employment Works Program, is the successor of the
BISM Pricing Committee, which was eliminated by the new law. The new
Committee consists of the Secretaries of DGS and DPSCS, but replacing the
BISM and NFB members with the Secretary of Transportation, Assistant
Secretary for Vocational Rehabilitation within the State Department of
Education, and the Secretary of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, or their
respective designees.
Under the new law, the Pricing and Selection Committee shall set the prices of
supplies and services that BISM provides to reflect their fair market prices.
The committee is also responsible for maintaining a current list of those
supplies and services, periodically reviewing and revising the list, and sending
the list to DGS. DGS is required to make a price list of those supplies and
services available to State agencies
Recommendation 2.1
We recommend that
a. the Pricing and Selection Committee set the fair market prices of all BISM
products and services for sale to the State;
b. the Committee maintain a current list of those products and services,
including making timely revisions to the list as necessary, and send the list
to DGS;
c. DGS make the Committee approved list of BISM supplies and services
available to State agencies; and
d. BISM retain documentation of initial product pricing and maintain
complete records of supplies or services submitted for pricing to the
Committee.
Finding 2.2
Based on our review of selected BISM products, BISM prices, on an overall
basis, were competitive with the prices of similar third-party competitor
products offered for sale to the public.
34

Analysis
Based on our review of selected BISM products, BISM prices, on an overall
basis, were competitive with Internet prices of similar third-party competitor
products offered for sale to the public. However, the methodology used to
perform our price comparisons and reach that conclusion had certain
limitations that could have affected our results. For example, State
regulations describe current average market price as the basis for BISM
prices. Consequently, the Internet prices we obtained were at a particular
point of time and, therefore, might not have been representative of the prices
available at other times. Also, the determination of the average market price
for a product is influenced by the number of vendors surveyed and the
disparity in their prices, as one vendor with a widely different price (either
higher or lower) could skew the average.
We also identified at least three other factors that make a reliable price
comparison difficult to perform.
1. Shipping costs could be a factor. BISM offers free shipping, as did
some vendors, while other vendors offered free shipping with
purchases over a certain dollar amount. If separately charged, we did
not consider shipping costs when determining vendors’ prices.
2. Product quality could vary. Our search relied on the accuracy of
product descriptions and quantities (for example, volume) offered by
Internet vendors, but we could not gauge the quality of those products
as compared to BISM products.
3. Volume pricing discounts could be offered by Internet vendors. For
example, BISM will offer certain volume discounts to State agencies
and it is likely that other vendors would do the same depending on the
quantity purchased, although this could not be reasonably determined
through our search.
We selected 14 of the highest selling products based on fiscal year 2015
BISM sales in dollars to the State (total sales of products tested were $4.46
million), and we performed an Internet search to identify the prices at which a
similar product could be purchased based on product description. We
obtained five prices for each product during the period from September 18,
2015 through September 22, 2015 (note, prices can vary daily). In total,
prices were obtained from 35 different vendors.
Exhibit 3 contains the result of our survey and provides the description of
each product; the number of units sold to the State during fiscal year 2015;
the 2015 total dollar sales to the State; the average BISM price (based on
35

--- Page 38 ---
actual 2015 sales activity)3; the BISM list price as of July 1, 2015 (the most
recent published price); and the low, average, median, and high Internet
prices. We included median Internet prices to provide an additional
comparison (as previously mentioned average market prices from the Internet
vendors would be subject to the effect of one vendor with a highly divergent
price). The results of the pricing comparisons are as follows:
Comparison of BISM Prices to the Average Internet Prices
Our comparison of the average BISM unit prices paid by the State during fiscal
year 2015 (after discounts) to the average Internet prices offered by vendors,
disclosed that 12 of the 14 items were priced lower by BISM. Based on the
quantities purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015, the cost for all 14
items would be $1,052,000 less from BISM based on the average BISM
prices versus the average prices offered by the vendors.
Our comparison of the BISM list prices to the average Internet prices showed
that 10 of the 14 items were priced lower by BISM. Based on the quantities
purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015, the cost for all 14 items was
$344,112 less from BISM based on the BISM list prices versus the average
prices offered by the vendors.
Comparison of BISM Prices to the Lowest Internet Prices
Our comparison of the average BISM unit prices paid by the State during fiscal
year 2015 (after discounts) to the lowest Internet prices offered by vendors,
disclosed that 8 of the 14 items were priced lower by BISM. Based on the
quantities purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015, the cost for all 14
items would be $877 more from BISM based on the average BISM prices
versus the lowest prices offered by the vendors.
Our comparison of the BISM list prices to the lowest Internet prices showed
that for 11 of the 14 items, other vendors had lower prices. Based on the
quantities purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015, the cost for all 14
items was $708,000 more from BISM based on the BISM list prices versus
the lowest prices offered by the vendors.
Comparison of BISM Prices to the Median Internet Prices
Our comparison of the average BISM unit prices paid by the State during fiscal
year 2015 (after discounts) to the median Internet prices of vendors,
disclosed that 8 of the 14 items were priced lower by BISM. Based on the
quantities purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015, the cost for all 14
3 Due to volume discounts, the total dollar sales divided by the total units sold will not equal
the BISM list price. We calculated an average BISM unit price using actual sales figures
(this is lower than the list price and reflects any discounts).
36

--- Page 39 ---
items was $966,000 less from BISM based on the average BISM prices
versus the median prices offered by the vendors.
Our comparison of the BISM list prices to the median Internet prices showed
that for 8 of the 14 items, the BISM prices were lower. Based on the
quantities purchased by the State during fiscal year 2015, the cost for all 14
items was $258,000 less from BISM based on the BISM list prices versus the
median internet prices offered by the vendors.
Notwithstanding the limitations noted above, our analysis indicates that in
four of the six price comparison scenarios, BISM’s prices were collectively
more favorable for the 14 products State agencies bought from BISM during
fiscal year 2015. Two of those four favorable scenarios are based on using
the average market prices, which should be considered by the pricing
committee to determine fair market prices according to State regulations.
Finally, we performed an additional procedure to determine the
reasonableness of BISM pricing, using information provided to BISM by a
State university that requested prices for products it previously obtained from
a contractor. In this regard, State law enacted in 2013 now requires that a
State maintenance contract with a component for housekeeping or janitorial
services include a provision requiring the prime contractor to procure janitorial
products from BISM when the specified products are available from BISM.
Using product, price and quantity information supplied by the university, we
determined the university could potentially save $63,400 under a contract it
recently awarded for janitorial services. BISM offers 56 products similar to
the products that the university had purchased under a previous contract with
another vendor. The current BISM list prices for 19 of those products were
lower and the other 37 were higher than the previous vendor’s prices, without
considering discounts BISM might offer. Even so, if the university purchases
the 56 products from BISM at the same quantities that it purchased from the
previous vendor, the university could still realize a net savings of
approximately $63,400.
Recommendation 2.2
No recommendation required.

Finding 2.3
Differing legal opinions and a court ruling raise questions as to whether the
products BISM sells to State agencies under the procurement preference
must meet a certain threshold of direct blind labor hours as specified in State
law.
Analysis
Differing legal opinions and a court ruling raise questions as to whether the
products BISM sells to State agencies under the procurement preference
must meet a certain threshold of direct blind labor hours as specified in State
law. Based on legal advice we sought, counsel to the General Assembly
reaffirmed a 1993 Attorney General’s Opinion that concluded that only
products with at least 75 percent blind labor qualify for the BISM State
procurement preference.
BISM disagrees with that conclusion based on a 1995 Baltimore City Circuit
Court conclusion. Consequently, BISM does not maintain records that would
be necessary to identify direct blind labors hours for products sold to State
agencies.
Since the 1995 Court decision, BISM has relocated to Baltimore County.
According to legal counsel, if the matter is again raised before the court in
another jurisdiction (such as Baltimore County), a different decision could be
reached regarding whether BISM is required to comply with the blind labor
threshold
The 1993 Opinion concluded that only such supplies and services provided
with at least 75 percent blind labor qualify for the BISM State procurement
preference, and the 75 percent requirement must be met on a product by
product basis. The Opinion was requested by the MSDE’s DORS in connection
with the preference BISM received to operate blind vending operations at
State facilities (which BISM no longer operates).
At that time, BISM asserted that it was a State agency and therefore outside
of the scope of the statute requirements. The Opinion did not accept that
assertion; rather, it deemed BISM as a “quasi-public corporation.”
Subsequently, DORS attempted to enforce the 75 percent direct labor
requirement and indicated that if BISM would not comply DORS would ignore
BISM’s State procurement preference.
In response, BISM sought a declaratory judgment essentially reversing the
1993 Attorney General’s Opinion by arguing that it was a State agency. In
1995, the Baltimore City Circuit Court concluded the direct labor requirement
38

--- Page 41 ---
does not apply because, in the context of this issue, the Court deemed BISM a
State entity, and therefore exempt from the requirement. Based on this
decision, which DORS did not appeal, BISM does not maintain records of
direct blind labor hours used to produce each product sold to the State.
Based on advice we recently received from legal counsel to the General
Assembly, counsel continues to affirm the tenets of the 1993 Attorney
General’s Opinion and notes that the Circuit Court ruling applies in Baltimore
City. BISM’s headquarters is currently located in Baltimore County. If a
similar motion was brought before the court in another jurisdiction, such as
the Baltimore County Circuit Court, a different decision could be reached.
Legal counsel advised that although the 1995 judgment could be recognized
by Circuit Courts in other jurisdictions, unless that happens, or the Opinion is
reviewed or altered by the Office of the Attorney General, that ruling would not
take precedence over the 1993 Attorney General’s Opinion, as neither would
be binding on a court, but each would be entitled to careful consideration.
If the blind labor requirement is applicable to BISM, additional questions are
raised about what types of labor would qualify, including whether the law,
which was originally enacted a century ago, gives sufficient recognition to the
types of work now available to, and can be provided by, the blind.
BISM’s original enabling legislation, enacted in 1908, defines direct labor
hours as including all hours spent in the manufacturing and assembly of a
product made by blind individuals. The definition also specifically excludes
time spent in administration, supervision, shipping, and inspection.
Consequently, according to legal counsel to the General Assembly, products
and services where blind people predominantly serve in those roles do not
qualify for the procurement preference. Legal counsel further advised that
this limitation makes sense in the context of labeling a product as made by
the blind, but it may no longer reflect the range of employment and training
that BISM can make available to the blind.
Recommendation 2.3
We recommend that BISM take necessary action to ensure compliance with
State law.

Objective 3
Executive Compensation and Ethics Requirements for
Management and Board Members
Finding 3.1
The annual evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer, an important aspect in
setting the CEO’s compensation, was not directly linked to specific
measurable BISM goals. Also, the CEO’s Performance Bonus Program was
not defined and documented.
Analysis
The annual evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)4, an important
aspect in setting the CEO’s compensation, was not directly linked to specific
measurable BISM goals. Therefore, while a general assessment of the CEO’s
performance was performed for a number of areas of BISM operations, it was
not based on the achievement of specific measurable goals for these areas
such as sales, fundraising, employment, and financial sustainability. BISM did
conduct salary surveys of comparable positions, which is an acceptable
approach for determining the reasonableness of CEO compensation for
nonprofits. Nevertheless, the bonus portion of the CEO’s compensation,
which accounted for 52 percent of the CEO’s fiscal year 2016 Board approved
compensation of $472,500, was awarded to reach a desired total
compensation level without defining the nature of the Performance Bonus
Program referred to in the CEO’s Employment Agreements.5 Finally, BISM did
not retain certain records pertaining to the annual evaluation process and an
executed copy of the CEO’s contract.
Annual Evaluation
The Board of Directors’ evaluation process, which is administered by its
Personnel Committee, did not require an assessment of CEO performance
with respect to achieving specific goals. The evaluation form lists 33
attributes in 6 categories (relationships with the Board, community and staff,
leadership, business and finance, and personal qualities) that are to be
individually assessed by each Board member using a scale ranging from one
(unsatisfactory) to ten (outstanding). None of the attributes requires an
evaluation of achieving specific goals. Such goals could include sales and
fundraising growth, increases in employment of the blind, training and
rehabilitation outcomes, and financial sustainability. According to the CEO’s
4 The CEO and President at BISM is the same person.
5 For fiscal year 2016, the CEO took a voluntary 10 percent reduction from the original Board
approved compensation of $525,000 (which consisted of a $250,000 base salary and a
bonus of $275,000). The same percentage reduction was taken for fiscal year 2015.
40

--- Page 43 ---
contract, one of the CEO’s primary responsibilities is to implement tactics and
programs to accomplish BISM’s objectives, so the evaluation process should
address the CEO’s results in achieving those objectives.
The results of the evaluations conducted during the last quarter in fiscal year
2015 indicate that the Board members were pleased with the CEO’s
performance. The overall average score for all attributes by the 11 Board
members was 9.5 out of 10. The individual evaluation forms completed by
the Board members during the preceding two fiscal years were not retained;
however, based on the report from the Personnel Committee to the Board, the
evaluation results for those years were similar to 2015.
Compensation Survey
The Board, through its Personnel Committee, obtains comparable
compensation data from several sources to ensure the CEO’s compensation is
reasonable, which is a requirement of the Internal Revenue Service for not-for-
profit entities. The sources include publicly available annual information
returns that tax exempt organizations are required to file by the federal
Internal Revenue Service (specifically, the Internal Revenue Service Form
990). Additionally, the Committee considers information from various salary
surveys of not-for-profit organizations.
The Committee’s annual salary surveys conducted during fiscal years 2013 –
2015 concluded that, after adjusting for the cost of living, the BISM CEO’s
total compensation (base salary, bonus and other compensation) was
comparable to the compensation provided to CEOs of blind industries
organizations operating in other parts of the country. After our review of this
data and an analysis we performed using gross receipts, we concluded that
the BISM CEO’s compensation is comparable to compensation paid to three
other similarly-sized blind industries organizations.
Using the 2013 Form 990 information (which was the basis for BISM’s 2015
salary review and the compensation set for fiscal year 2016), we calculated
the percentage of CEO compensation (after adjusting for the cost of living), in
relation to gross receipts for BISM (approximately $91 million) and the three
closest blind industries organizations in terms of gross receipts (ranging from
$79 million to $105 million). We found that the average ratio of adjusted CEO
compensation to gross receipts for the three other organizations was 0.55
percent, while BISM’s ratio was slightly higher at 0.57 percent (see Exhibit 4).
However, for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, BISM’s CEO did take a voluntary 10
percent reduction, resulting in salary (including bonus) of $472,500, which
the Board approved. After considering this reduced salary amount (and other
compensation typically provided by BISM, such as retirement contributions),
41

--- Page 44 ---
the BISM CEO’s compensation to sales ratio would be reduced from 0.57
percent to 0.55 percent, which is the average ratio of the three other
organizations’ CEO compensation.
This comparison, however, is one approach that could be used to evaluate
CEO compensation. Other approaches could be based on the financial results
of operations. In addition, any financial-related comparisons would not
address an assessment of CEO performance in other areas. Finally, there
could be other operational considerations, such as whether an organization
provides rehabilitation and training services and the extent to which those
operations benefit from purchasing preferences provided under law.
Performance Bonus Program
BISM was unable to provide us with any documentation defining the CEO’s
bonus, including a description of the intent of the bonus and methodology for
determining the bonus amount. The CEO’s contract for fiscal year 2016,
which at the time of our audit was not signed by any parties, specifies that, in
addition to the annual base salary, the CEO may be eligible to receive annual
incentive compensation under the “Performance Bonus Program” at the
discretion of the Board.
We were advised by the Board Chairman that the bonus awarded by the Board
was a mechanism for bridging the difference between the BISM’s CEO’s base
salary, which is included within a broad salary scale for other management
employees (see finding 3.2), and the compensation paid to peer CEO’s based
upon its annual surveys. According to the Chairman, the Board did not feel it
necessary to establish a separate pay grade applicable only to one person,
the CEO.
Recommendation 3.1
We recommend that BISM
a. enhance the CEO annual evaluation process by incorporating attributes
pertaining to achieving specific measurable goals;
b. develop a written performance bonus plan, approved by the Board, that
includes a description of the purpose and methodology for determining
the CEO’s bonus;
c. retain documentation supporting compensation determinations (such as
Board prepared evaluations, bonus awards) for the period of the
applicable employment contract; and
d. ensure that employment contracts are properly executed.
42

--- Page 45 ---
Finding 3.2
BISM has not established a formal compensation review policy for its non-CEO
executive-level positions.
Analysis
BISM has not established a formal compensation review policy for its non-CEO
executive-level positions to ensure that those individuals are evaluated based
on measurable goals and objectives and to demonstrate that the salaries,
including sales commissions, for those positions are reasonable.
Nine of the ten non-CEO executive level personnel are evaluated annually by
the BISM CEO using the same evaluation form established for evaluating all
associates, which essentially represents the entire BISM staff.6 The
evaluation form collectively includes an assessment of 11 attributes that are
classified in three categories: work effectiveness, personal effectiveness, and
leadership effectiveness. None of the attributes on those forms requires an
evaluation of achieving position goals, such as achieving sales goals and
increasing operational efficiency. The results of the evaluation process are
used to consider annual salary adjustments.
BISM has not demonstrated that the salaries set for these individuals (as well
as the commissions for certain sales and marketing executive positions) were
reasonable based on market surveys and analyses. We noted that all ten
employees (as well as the CEO), are included in same salary pay grade, which
had a salary range from $93,478 to $255,000. Included in that category are
the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Director of Sales and
Marketing, and a senior director position, whose individual salaries ranged
from approximately $125,000 to $184,000 during calendar year 2013.
We compared the 2013 salaries paid by BISM to three of the non-CEO
executive staff positions (Chief Operating Officer, Chief Accounting Officer,
senior director) to the salaries of employees in similar positions at other like
entities using publicly available salary information. Although there may have
been some variances in specific job responsibilities, the results suggest that
the BISM salaries set for these individuals were comparable to those paid by
the other entities.
6 The annual evaluation for one employee is prepared by that employee’s immediate
supervisor, the Vice-President of Sales and Marketing.
43

--- Page 46 ---
Recommendation 3.2
We recommend that BISM
a. develop a formal compensation review policy for its non-CEO executive
staff, which is approved by the Board, to ensure that the performance
evaluation process is tailored for those positions and incorporates
attributes pertaining to achieving measurable goals and objectives; and
b. ensure that compensation for the non-CEO executive staff is reasonable
based on market surveys and analysis.
Finding 3.3
A comprehensive code of ethics policy and appropriate financial disclosure
requirements were established. Policy compliance was properly monitored.
Analysis
A comprehensive code of ethics and appropriate financial disclosure
requirements were established and compliance with the policy was properly
monitored.
BISM established an employee Conflict of Interest Policy in September 2010,7
which originally required the submission of a Disclosure Statement once every
two years. Beginning in 2015, the statement is to be filed annually. The Policy
and the Disclosure Statement also address the acceptance of gifts by
employees. Members of the BISM Board of Trustees and all executive level
employees, as well as certain other management employees must complete
an annual acknowledgement that they have read the Conflict of Interest Policy
and submit it along with an annual Disclosure Statement to the BISM
Personnel Department. A designated employee monitors the submission and
content of the required disclosures.
Our review of the aforementioned policy and Disclosure Statement found that
they were comprehensive, as they addressed those circumstances where
conflicts of interest would likely occur and included a requirement that they be
updated and resubmitted whenever an employee’s circumstances change.
Furthermore, we found that the BISM Disclosure Statement was comparable
to those included in a certain published guide for non-profits as well as with
the content requirements established in the Maryland Public Ethics law for
State officials and applicable employees.
Our review of required submissions of BISM Conflict of Interest Policy
acknowledgements and Disclosure Statements for fiscal years 2013 and
7 At the same time, BISM also established a Whistleblower Policy for employees and a policy
on Gift Acceptance by BISM, as a corporation.
44

--- Page 47 ---
2015 disclosed that all employees who were required to file had complied
and no apparent conflict of interests was reported.
Recommendation 3.3
No recommendation required.

Blind Industries and Services of Maryland
Response to
Legislative Audit Report
OBJECTIVE 1
Blind Industries and Services of Maryland Strategies to Promote Work, Career, and
Training Opportunities, and Services for Blind and Visually-Impaired Persons in
Maryland
FINDING 1.1
Until September 2015, BISM had not formally adopted strategies to accomplish
organizational goals it established in 2013. Also, BISM has not taken the next step of
developing action plans or measures to assess the success of those efforts.
Recommendation 1.1
We recommend that BISM
a. develop action plans for its strategies initiatives identifying steps to be taken, those
individuals responsible for completing the tasks and related timeframes;
b. develop performance measures to assess whether the actions taken are achieving
desired results; and
c. conduct ongoing monitoring of plans and outcomes.
BISM Response
BISM accepts the recommendation.
FINDING 1.2
BISM conducts outreach programs to inform Maryland residents of available services.
The needs of blind individuals requesting services appear to be met.
Recommendation 1.2
No recommendation required.
BISM Response
BISM agrees that we are successfully meeting the goal of servicing the blind
community.
FINDING 1.3
BISM has assumed more financial responsibility over its various rehabilitation and
training programs offered to blind individuals.
Recommendation 1.3
No recommendation required.
BISM Response
BISM accepts the recommendation.
1

--- Page 56 ---
FINDING 1.4
Many former CORE students completing the program have reported achieving
successful post-training outcomes, but BISM has not established a process for tracking
student satisfaction with some of its services.
Recommendation 1.4
We recommend that BISM establish a formal process for determining and tracking
student/client satisfactions for all its training and rehabilitation services.
BISM Response
BISM will enhance its current evaluation process to meet the recommendation.
OBJECTIVE 2
BISM Pricing Policies and Practices for Supplies and Services Sold to Maryland State
Agencies
FINDING 2.1
Pricing committees established by State law had not conducted a comprehensive
review of the prices of BISM’s supplies and services available to State agencies.
Recommendation 2.1
We recommend that
a. the Pricing and Selection Committee set the fair market prices of all BISM products
and services for sale to the State;
b. the Committee maintain a current list of those products and services;
c. DGS make the Committee approved list of BISM supplies and services available to
State agencies; and
d. BISM retain documentation of initial product pricing and maintain complete records
of supplies or services submitted for pricing to the Committee.
BISM Response
BISM will certainly work with the Pricing and Selection Committee, of which BISM
is not a party. (BISM was removed from the Pricing Committee pursuant to House
Bill 349). BISM will provide and maintain all requested product and pricing
matters that the Pricing and Selection Committee requests.
FINDING 2.2
Based on our review of selected BISM products, BISM prices, on an overall basis, were
competitive with the prices of similar third party competitor products offered for sale to
the public.
Recommendation 2.2
No recommendation required.
BISM response
BISM accepts the recommendation.
2

--- Page 57 ---
FINDING 2.3
Differing legal opinions and court ruling raise questions as to whether the products
BISM sells to State agencies under the procurement preference must meet a certain
threshold of direct blind labor hours as specified in State law.
Recommendation 2.3
We recommend that BISM take necessary action to ensure compliance with State law.
BISM Response
BISM has and will comply with all Federal and State laws and regulations. We are
providing the following legal analysis:
Blind Industries and Services of Maryland (“BISM”) is a corporation created by §
7-703 of the Human Services Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
However, the “genesis of BISM may be found in legislation enacted in 1908.” 78
Md. Op. Atty. Gen. 128 (1993). Under the current statutory scheme, BISM is
controlled by an 11-member Board of Trustees (the “Board”). Hum. Serves. § 7-
703. The eleven Board members are “appointed by the Governor with the advice
and consent of the Senate.” Id. The Board is granted certain discretionary
powers and mandatory duties. Id. § 7-703(h), (i).
The authority of the circuit courts of Maryland is defined by Article IV, § 20 of the
Maryland Constitution and § 1–501 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings
Article. The Maryland Constitution provides, in relevant part, that each circuit
court has “all the power, authority and jurisdiction, original and appellate, which
the Circuit Courts of the counties exercised on [4 November 1980].” Md. Const.,
Art. IV, § 20. Circuit courts are the “highest common-law and equity courts of
record exercising original jurisdiction within the State,” and have “full common-
law and equity powers and jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases within its
county, ... except where by law jurisdiction has been limited or conferred
exclusively upon another tribunal.” Md.Code, Courts & Judicial Proceedings
Article, § 1–501. Kent Island, LLC at 363, 61 A.3d at 29-30 (2013). A circuit court
does not possess jurisdiction generally to review, modify, or overrule orders
entered by another circuit court, all things being equal. See Md. Const., Art. IV, §
20; Solomon v. Solomon, 118 Md.App. 96, 114, 701 A.2d 1199, 1207 (1997). “The
acts of a competent tribunal cannot be reviewed collaterally. They are to be taken
as a just and proper exercise of power in all other Courts.” Clark v. Southern Can
Co., 116 Md. 85, 93, 81 A. 271, 274 (1911) (quoting Cook's Lessee v. Carroll, 6 Md.
104, 112 (1854)). See also Johnson v. Johnson, 265 Md. 327, 331, 289 A.2d 318,
320 (1972) (“[A] final determination reached by a court having jurisdiction
[cannot] be made the subject of collateral attack.”); Dorsey v. Wroten, 35 Md.App.
359, 361, 370 A.2d 577, 579 (1977). Kent Island, LLC, at 364, 61 A.3d at 30.
The Attorney General, on the other hand, is charged with giving his opinion in
writing whenever required by the General Assembly or either branch thereof, the
3

--- Page 58 ---
Governor, the Comptroller, the Treasurer or any State's Attorney on any legal
matter or subject. Md. Const. Art. V, § 3. An Attorney General Opinion is just
that- an opinion. Whereas the Circuit Court issues decisions and court orders.
Court orders and decisions are binding on the parties that come before the court,
and over which the court has jurisdiction as defined by Maryland law.
Attorney General Opinions are advisory only to Maryland courts. See Maryland
Automobile Insurance Fund v. Lumbermen’s Mutual Casualty Company, 148 Md.
App. 690, 701; 814 A.2d 52, 59 (2002). There are instances in which the court will
accept interpretations contained in opinions of the Attorney General, it is
primarily where it appears that the Legislature has acquiesced to the Attorney
General's opinion. Scott v. Clerk of Circuit Court for Frederick County, 112 Md.
App. 234, 243; 684 A.2d 896, 900 (1996). Courts are not bound by an Attorney
General's Opinion, but that “when the meaning of legislative language is not
entirely clear, such legal interpretation should be given great consideration in
determining the legislative intention.” State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees, 330 Md.
460, 470, 624 A.2d 955, 960 (1993); see also Read Drug & Chem. Co. v. Claypoole,
165 Md. 250, 257, 166 A. 742, 745 (1933). The Legislature is presumed to be aware
of the Attorney General's statutory interpretation and, in the absence of enacting
any change to the statutory language, to acquiesce in the Attorney General's
construction. See Claypoole, supra, 165 Md. at 257–58, 166 A. at 742.
There are numerous Attorney General Opinions discussing whether BISM is a
State agency, which have resulted in a mixed record – some opining that BISM is
a State agency and others that BISM is not a State agency. See 21 Md. Op. Atty
Gen. 170 (1936) (opining that BISM’s predecessor, The Workshop and School for
the Blind, was a State agency “for the administration of a State plan for aid to the
blind” under federal law); 40 Md. Atty. Op Gen. 120 (1955) (opining that BISM’s
predecessor was not a State-owned entity and not exempt from Baltimore City’s
Building Code); 50 Md. Op. Atty Gen. 188 (1965) (opining that BISM was a State
agency for the purpose of receiving financial assistance administered by the
State Department of Education); .53 Md. Op. Atty. Gen. 249 (1968) (opining that
BISM’s predecessor was a “semi-autonomous corporate entity” and not State
employees).
There is no definitive answer regarding whether BISM is a State entity; instead
the court must consider “whether an entity is a State entity for a particular
purpose.” 98 Op. Atty. Gen. 114, 128 (2013) (quoting A.S. Abell Publishing Co. v.
Mezzanote, 297 Md. 26, 35 (1983)). To make this evaluation, one must look to the
“characteristics and functions of the entity in the context of the particular statute
at issue to determine whether the entity is intended to be viewed, for purposes of
that statute, as a State entity.” Id. (quoting 78 Md. Op. Atty. Gen. 128, 134 (1993)).
The Attorney General Opinions have stated that this is an ad hoc decision that
could lead to an entity being considered a State agency for one purpose but not
for another. Id.
78 Md. Op. Atty. Gen. 128 classifies BISM as “quasi-public corporation” that “has
conducted itself much as a private entity, operating in accord with its own
bylaws, setting compensation for its employees, and obtaining status as a
4

--- Page 59 ---
nonprofit, charitable corporation under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.”
Further, quasi-public corporations “are private in ownership, ‘but which,
nevertheless, by reason of the nature and extent of their operations and effect on
the welfare of the public at large, have been styled quasi-public corporation.” Id.
(quoting Potter v. Bethesda Fire Dep’t, 309 Md. 347, 357, 524 A.2d 61 (1987)).
The Circuit Court case involved here, Blind Industries and Services of Maryland v.
Maryland State Department of Education, Division of Rehabilitation Services, et
al., Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Case No: CL 196189, considered the
implications of a specific statute: Art. 30, § 30A, which required products made by
the blind, to be made by at least 75% blind individuals. Specifically, the court
considered whether pursuant to this statute, BISM was a State agency. Id. The
court looked at 78 Md. Op. Atty. Gen. 128, which considered this exact issue, and
overruled the legal reasoning. Id. The court stated that the statute set BISM up
as the watchdog for this 75% requirement throughout the State, and therefore
was considered a State agency pursuant to this statute. Id. As a result of being a
State agency, the direct labor requirements would not apply to BISM, but should
be used by BISM and the Legislature when investigating other sellers of blind
products:
“BISM’s characteristics and functions in the context of Art. 30, §30A are clear.
BISM is the entity whose purpose is to aid and provide for Maryland’s blind
citizens. Its powers and duties are enumerated by law, and the State scrutinizes
its programs and the blind community’s participation in them. Section 30A
simply prevents others from sailing under false colors, and appoints BISM as its
watchdog. The Court concludes that BISM should be viewed as a State entity for
purposes of Art 30, § 30A, and is therefore not subject to the direct labor
requirements specified therein.” Id.
The court also stated that although this would not impact BISM, as BISM is not
governed by the statute, the direct labor requirements should be measured on a
product-by-product basis, and only applied to products, not services. Id. Since
the statutory language is still valid, but has simply been recodified, the court
ruling would still control.
The General Assembly argues that the Circuit Court case is not binding on BISM
because its new headquarters is located in Baltimore County, and if a similar
motion was brought, the Baltimore County Circuit Court would have jurisdiction.
Finding 2.3. The General Assembly findings goes on to state that the Circuit
Court ruling would not take precedence over the Attorney General Opinion in a
new hearing because neither is binding on the new court. Id. It is true, as the
General Assembly admits, that the Attorney General Opinion would not be
binding on the Court, as detailed above. However, this argument related to
Circuit Court jurisdiction is akin to saying that if a defendant is found guilty of
murder in one county in Maryland, they could move to another county and live
freely until the new county enters its own guilty verdict. In addition, this
argument fails to consider the legal principals of res judicata and collateral
estoppel.
5

--- Page 60 ---
The doctrines of “res judicata” and “collateral estoppel,” “which are also known
by their more descriptive names: claim preclusion and issues preclusion” act as
a bar to relitigation of a claim or issue previously litigated. Mostofi v. Midland
Funding, LLC, 223 Md. App. 687, 696, 117 A.3d 639, 644 (2015). Claim preclusion
means that a party can no longer bring a claim because “a judgment between the
same parties and their privies is a final bar to any other suit upon the same cause
of action, and is conclusive, not only as to all matters that have been decided in
the original suit, but as to all matters which with propriety could have been
litigated in the first suit.” Lizzi v. Wash. Metro. Transit Authority, 384 Md. 199,
207, 862 A.2d 1017, 1022 (2004) (quoting Alvey v. Alvey, 225 Md. 386, 390, 171
A.2d 92 (1961)) (emphasis added). Issue preclusion means that if a previous case
took place between the same parties or their privies, and the fact-finder made a
finding that was “essential to” the judgment entered, all future cases between
those parties are stuck with that finding and cannot re-litigate the question.
Welsh v. Gerber Products, Inc., 315 Md. 510, 516, 555 A.2d 486 (1989). “In sum,
claim preclusion bars litigation of claims, whereas issue preclusion generally
bars re-litigation of facts.” Mostofi, 223 Md. App. at 696, 117 A.3d at 644
(emphasis in original).
“Claim preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of a
matter that has never been litigated, because of a determination that it should
have been advanced in an earlier suit. Claim preclusion therefore encompasses
the law of merger and bar.” Kent County Bd. of Educ. v. Bilbrough, 309 Md. 487,
489-90, 525 A.2d 232, 233 (1987) (quoting Migra v. Warren City School Bd. of
Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1, 104 S. Ct. 892, 894 n.1 (1984)). Issue preclusion “refers
to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been
litigated and decided.” Id. These two doctrines serve the same judicial policy:
“that the losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered, in
adversarial proceedings, on issues raised, or that should have been raised.”
Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass'n, Inc., 361 Md. 371, 761 A.2d 899 (2000).
Neither claim preclusion, nor issue preclusion require that the prior trials be in
the same court, nor that they were decided by the Court of Appeals. Instead, any
court decision involving the same parties and/or issues are controlled by the
initial decision, unless the aggrieved party appeals it to a higher court, which
overturns the decision. The General Assembly admits that the Maryland State
Department of Education’s Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) did not
appeal the Circuit Court’s decision, nor did the agency challenge the jurisdiction
of the Court. Therefore, all parties are still bound by that decision.
Jurisdiction embraces two distinct concepts: “(i) the power of a court to render a
valid decree, and (ii) the propriety of granting the relief sought.” Maryland Bd. of
Nursing v. Nechay, 347 Md. 396, 406, 701 A.2d 405, 410 (1997) (quoting Moore v.
McAllister, 216 Md. 497, 507, 141 A.2d 176, 182 (1958)). Whether a court has
fundamental jurisdiction, or the “power, or authority, ... to render a valid final
judgment,” is determined by the applicable constitutional and statutory
provisions. Kent Island, LLC v. DiNapoli, 430 Md. 348, 362-63, 61 A.3d 21, 29
(2013). (Quoting Kaouris v. Kaouris, 324 Md. 687, 708, 598 A.2d 1193, 1203 (1991)).
6

--- Page 61 ---
The Circuit Court decision amounts to a court order issued by the Circuit Court
for Baltimore City. BISM obviously must follow all court orders to which they
were a party throughout the State. Finally, BISM continues to operate and do
business in Baltimore City. Therefore, it is still under the purview of the Circuit
Court for Baltimore City.
Auditor’s Comment: OLA’s recommendation that BISM take the necessary action to ensure
compliance with State law was based on advice provided by legal counsel to the Maryland
General Assembly regarding the applicability of certain laws to BISM. In its response, BISM
stated that it has and will comply with all federal and State laws and regulations and
provided a large body of court cases and law references to support its position. OLA shared
this response with its legal counsel, who reaffirmed the advice provided to OLA, which forms
the basis for the audit finding and related recommendation. Consequently, unless the
applicability of certain laws to BISM is pursued in the court system or legislation is passed to
clarify the matter, no further action is likely to resolve the legal disagreement and change
BISM’s practices.
OBJECTIVE 3
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND ETHICS REQUIREMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT
AND BOARD MEMBERS
FINDING 3.1
The annual evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer, an important aspect of setting the
CEO’s compensation, was not directly linked to specific measurable BISM goals. Also
the CEO’s Performance Bonus Program was not defined and documented.
Recommendation 3.1
We recommend that BISM
a. enhance the CEO annual evaluation process by incorporating attributes
pertaining to achieving specify measurable goals;
b. develop a written performance bonus plan, approved by the Board, that includes
a description of the purpose and methodology for determining the CEO’s bonus;
c. retain documentation supporting compensation determinations (such as Board
prepared evaluations, bonus awards) for the period of the applicable employment
contract; and
d. ensure that employment contracts are properly executed.
BISM Response
BISM accepts the recommendation.
FINDING 3.2
BISM has not established a formal compensation review policy for its non-CEO
executive-level positions.
7

--- Page 62 ---
Recommendation 3.2
We recommend that BISM
a. develop a formal compensation review policy for its non-CEO executive staff,
which is approved by the Board, to ensure that the performance evaluation
process is tailored for those positions and incorporates attributes pertaining to
achieving measurable goals and objectives; and
b. ensure that compensation for the non-CEO executive staff is reasonable based
on market survey and analysis.
BISM Response
BISM accepts the recommendation.
FINDING 3.3
A comprehensive code of ethics policy and appropriate financial disclosure
requirements were established. Policy compliance was properly monitored.
Recommendation 3.3
No Recommendation required.
BISM Response
BISM accepts the recommendation.

Responses From Department of General Services and Pricing and Selection
Committee for BISM and Employment Works Program
Recommendation 2.1
We recommend that
a. the Pricing and Selection Committee set the fair market prices of all BISM products and
services for sale to the State;
We concur that it is the responsibility of the Pricing and Selection Committee (PSC)to set the fair
market prices for supplies and services provided by BISM as required by the statute. The
appropriate Pricing & Selection Committee, prior to the listing of an item on the catalog,
reviewed and approved the fair market price for that supply or service. There is no requirement
that the entire catalog be reviewed every year to set the fair market prices. Typically, specific
supplies or services are reviewed when BISM proposes changes to supplies or services, or asks
for a price change.
Auditor’s Comment: The assertion that pricing committees have been routinely reviewing
and approving the fair market prices of all BISM supplies or services prior to listing items on
the BISM catalog could not be substantiated during this audit, as well as during a previous
fiscal compliance audit of the Department of General Services (DGS) - Office of Procurement
and Logistics. Further, we did not recommend an annual review of all products’ pricing, and
acknowledge that there is no requirement of an annual review of each product’s price.
b. the Committee maintain a current list of those products and services, including making
timely revisions to the list as necessary, and send the list to DGS;
We concur that it is the responsibility of the Pricing and Selection Committee to maintain, and
revise as necessary, a list of supplies and services provided by BISM and to provide that list to
DGS as required by the statute. We have such a list and have provided to DGS one update to the
list resulting from the fair market price approvals made at the BISM and Employment Works
Program (EWP) PSC meeting in November 2015.
The committee has no staff support for BISM market research or cost analysis, nor does it have
staff support of any kind as it relates to BISM. The Coordinating entity for the EWP is required
by the statute to provide such support for its items considered by the PSC. But as noted in the
audit report, prior State law (the now repealed SFP §14-104(e)) required the assistance of BISM
staff to support the operations of the committee. Accordingly, the work of BISM staff in
creating and maintaining this list (also as acknowledged in the audit report) was viewed by the
Committee as sufficient to meet the obligation for an up to date and accurately revised list.

--- Page 66 ---
A change to the statute should be considered to require BISM to provide similar staff support for
the BISM fair market price determinations, or alternatively, assign a staff member to the PSC to
be used for these purposes as determined by the PSC.
Auditor’s Comment: While current State law does not make a specific provision for
Committee support staff, the law does not preclude the use of staff resources available to
current Committee members consisting of the secretaries or assistant secretaries of five
State departments. We do not believe it is unrealistic for those members to provide staffing
from their departments to assist the Committee in fulfilling its responsibilities.
c. DGS make the Committee approved list of BISM supplies and services available to State
agencies; and
DGS has ensured that this information is available to agencies through a variety of ways.
Information regarding the offerings of all the preferred providers is posted on the DGS website at
http://dgs.maryland.gov/Documents/PerferredProviderProgram.pdf
There is a direct link to this document from the DGS Procurement webpage titled “Preferred
Provider Information” under the heading “Contracts and Bidding”at
http://www.dgs.maryland.gov/Pages/Procurement/index.aspx
Further, the specific BPOs from the State for conducting business with BISM are posted on the
“Open Bids and Contract Awards” at (select category “State Preferred Provider.”)
http://www.dgs.maryland.gov/Pages/Procurement/BidsAwards.aspx
Additionally, BISM maintains on their website under the “State” category a list of all products
and their pricing as approved by the PS&C
http://www.bism.org/store-home-page
Auditor’s Comment: The first three Internet links provided in the response are to DGS web
pages and are intended to guide the user to the Statewide Blanket Purchase Order (BPO) for
the BISM Master List of supplies and services. After using the third link to find a supply or
service offered by BISM, the subsequent link to the BPO for BISM supplies and services is
currently a dead link with no information available. Also, during the audit, we obtained a
copy of the related BPO and we found that it contained no pricing information but referred
the State agency to the products and prices on BISM’s website.
The fourth link leads to a spreadsheet on BISM’s website of the supplies and services for
sale to State agencies with corresponding prices. However, since this is BISM’s website and
document, sufficient assurance that these prices have been approved by the Committee is
lacking. OLA continues to believe that DGS should maintain an official BISM product and
price list for use by State agencies, unless a mechanism is established to periodically verify
BISM website prices.

--- Page 67 ---
