Audit Overview
(cid:190) Audit report, which covered the period from 4/05
through 1/08, included 9 findings, with 5 of those
repeated from the preceding audit report.
(cid:190) SIF pays workers’ compensation awards in
connection with claims for previously injured or
handicapped employees’ subsequent occupational
injuries or deaths. To fund these awards, employers
and insurance companies are assessed 6.5% on all
WCC death or permanent disability settlements and
awards.
(cid:190) For FY 2008, SIF assessments totaled $25.2 million,
SIF benefit payments totaled $20.8 million, and SIF
operating expenses totaled $1.8 million.
(cid:190) SIF maintains the accounts receivable records for
both its receivables and for the receivables of the
Uninsured Employers’ Fund (UEF). As of 1/09, the
accounts receivable balances totaled $27.3 million
for both Funds.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Virtually no controls over accounts receivable
records and the receivable records maintained for
UEF were not adequately maintained. Collection
actions on receivables were not taken in accordance
with Central Collection Unit regulations.
(cid:190) Internal control over cash receipts was inadequate
to ensure accountability over all collections.
(cid:190) Certain user capabilities and vendor access on the
automated accounts receivable and accounts
payable system compromised effective internal
control.
(cid:190) Physical security, environmental controls and
disaster recovery for IT operations were not
adequately addressed.
(cid:190) Improvements can be made in certain aspects of
payroll and procurement processing.

Accounts Receivable
SIF maintained an automated A/R system for itself
and for the UEF.
― SIF receivables ($726,000 as of 1/09) are
mainly unpaid assessments.
― UEF receivables ($26.6 million as of 1/09)
consist mostly of claim payments, including
medical payments, made to injured workers but
not yet reimbursed by uninsured employers.
(cid:131) The same SIF employee performed many
incompatible A/R and cash receipts duties.
Also, there was no independent verifications of
non-cash adjustments and the entries to
establish the receivables in the system.

Accounts Receivable (cont’d)
(cid:131) Automated accounts receivable records
maintained by SIF for UEF were not adequately
maintained; for example, some recorded
amounts did not agree with the nature of the
transaction or lacked support. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) SIF did not comply with Central Collection Unit
(CCU) regulations regarding collection activities
and timely transfers to CCU for collection.

Cash Receipts
SIF had not established adequate internal control
over cash receipts collected for itself and for UEF.
(Finding 4)
(cid:131) Fiscal year 2008 collections deposited by SIF
totaled $29.7 million.
(cid:131) The employee who processed collections for

verifications and could modify the initial receipt
records.

Information System Security and Control
(cid:190) Certain user capabilities compromised already
weak internal controls over A/R and cash
receipts. In additional to having abilities to
modify records, records could also be deleted
without any trail. (Finding 5)
(cid:190) Physical security, environmental control and
disaster recovery were not adequately
addressed. (Finding 6)
(cid:190) Contractor access to the system for
programming and operational support was not
sufficiently restricted or monitored. (Finding 7)
(cid:190) Logs of critical security events were not
reviewed for unauthorized or inappropriate
activities. (Finding 7)

Other Areas
(cid:190) Time reports submitted to the Central Payroll
Bureau should be prepared using approved
employee time records and independently
verified. (Finding 8)
(cid:190) Contractor services should be obtained and
documented in accordance with State
Procurement Regulations. (Finding 9)
(cid:190) The last two actuarial studies done in March
1996 and November 2003 indicated that SIF
had unfunded liabilities of $173 million and
$201 million, respectively. The Subsequent
Injury Fund balance at June 30, 2008 was
approximately $62.5 million. SIF indicated it
would obtain a new actuarial study in 2010.

Conclusion
(cid:190) SIF should ensure that employee duties over
accounts receivables and cash receipts are
properly separated, including employee
capabilities on the related automated system,
and ensure the propriety, accuracy and
completeness of all A/R and cash receipts
transactions in the records. SIF should also
comply with CCU regulations regarding
collection for unpaid accounts.
(cid:190) SIF should improve safeguards over its
automated systems, including physical security
and vendor access, environmental controls, and
disaster recovery.
(cid:190) SIF should make improvements in certain
aspects of payroll and procurement processing.
