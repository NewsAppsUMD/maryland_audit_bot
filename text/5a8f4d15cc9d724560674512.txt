AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Improve Overall Financial Controls
Potomac River Fisheries Commission (Commission) has experienced an overall weakness in
its operational and financial controls since the transition of the new Executive Secretary in fiscal year
2013. The Commission has not made improvements in several of the areas with weaknesses noted
in the prior year audit and new concerns surfaced during the fiscal year 2014 audit.
During the fiscal year 2013 audit, the Commission did not prepare bank reconciliations timely
and the Executive Secretary did not review the reconciliations. During fiscal year 2014, the
Commission did not prepare any bank reconciliations. The Commission hired an outside consultant
to assist staff with the operating account bank reconciliations for all of fiscal year 2014 in October
2014. There is no evidence that the Executive Secretary reviewed these reconciliations. The
Commission prepared year-end bank reconciliations for the remaining accounts in October and
November 2014. The Executive Secretary did review these reconciliations. Due to these issues, we
expanded our review of reconciliations into fiscal year 2015. Between July 2014 and February 2015,
the Commission prepared bank reconciliations for all accounts between 65 and 90 days after each
month end. The Executive Secretary did not review the reconciliations in certain cases until more
than six months after the reconciliation was prepared. Timely reconciliation of all bank accounts is
necessary to ensure that unauthorized expenses are not made and that deposits are properly
recorded.
During fiscal year 2013, the Executive Secretary did not review payroll. This lack of review
continued not only through fiscal year 2014, but also through March 2015. Management review of
payroll transactions is crucial to ensure that only current employees receive the correct pay. Further,
the absence of a review of payroll transactions together with the delay in preparation of bank
reconciliations could result in fraudulent payments to ghost employees.
The Administrative Assistant is the only employee with access to the Virginia Retirement
System (Retirement) benefit management system. This employee not only prepares payroll, but also
performs all Human Resources activities. The Administrative Assistant has the ability to make
changes at will in the payroll and retirement systems; perform the monthly contribution
confirmation; and submit the retirement contribution payment. While the Administrative Assistant
completed these tasks properly and timely during fiscal year 2014, management did not review these
transactions, and there is no one with the knowledge or ability to perform these tasks in the
Administrative Assistant’s absence. The Executive Secretary and Assistant Executive Secretary have
been approved for Retirement access but neither have taken the required training. The lack of
segregation of duties coupled with the lack of review of payroll transactions increases the risk for
inappropriate postings to the Retirement system.
Only the Assistant Executive Secretary or the Administrative Assistant review cash collections,
but there is no documentation that this review occurs. Commission cash collection procedures
require that the Executive Secretary perform at least a weekly review, as the Assistant Executive
Fiscal Year 2014 1

--- Page 8 ---
Secretary is responsible for completing the daily deposit and making the deposit at the bank. Lack
of consistent and documented review by the Executive Secretary increases the risk of manipulation
or mishandling of cash collections.
The Executive Secretary needs to devote an additional portion of his time to oversee the
financial administration of the Commission and ensure that proper controls are in place to properly
safeguard Commission assets. This includes systematic review of all payroll transactions, retirement
contributions, and cash collections by the Executive Secretary, and timely reconciliation of all bank
accounts and subsequent review.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve
and improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing
Virginia.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the
following sources.
Commission Revenues
2013 2014
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000
Federal grant 109,024 50,030
Sport fishing licenses 144,926 152,103
Commercial fishing licenses 76,215 77,545
Commercial crab licenses 70,820 71,500
Commercial oyster licenses 46,610 35,030
Commercial license surcharge 35,950 34,800
Oyster bushel tax 3,415 2,317
Interest and miscellaneous 27,466 25,682
Total revenue $803,176 $737,757
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission’s revenues decreased by eight percent for fiscal year 2014 mainly due to a
fifty percent decrease in the federal grant received from the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative
Management Act, a twenty-five percent decrease in commercial oyster licenses, and a three percent
decrease in the commercial license surcharge. These decreases were offset by an increase in the
sale of sport fishing and commercial licenses and additional participation in the oyster management
reserve program, discussed below. Sport fishing license revenues continue to trend upwards;
however, the upward trend in total for all commercial licenses has begun to even out and for fiscal
year 2014, actually decreased.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:
Commission Expenses
2013 2014
Personnel services $373,605 $405,662
Development and repletion 106,526 135,849
Federal grant 105,565 42,705
Contractual services 89,864 80,333
Materials and supplies 56,073 59,789
Insurance 7,426 14,218
Fixed assets 844 4,909
Operating Expenses 739,903 743,465
Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Oyster development 42,473 -
Retiree health care 75,000 53,500
Reserve Expenses 117,473 53,500
Total Expenses $857,376 $796,965
Source: Commission’s financial system
Total expenses decreased by $60,411 or seven percent from fiscal year 2013. This is
attributable in part to the reduction in grant expenses and no funding for the oyster development
reserve. Expenses did not decrease at the same rate as the decrease in revenues, in part due to a
nine percent increase in personnel services. The increase in personnel services included healthcare
premium increases and a one-time payout to the retired Executive Secretary for leave balances.
Increasing costs coupled with decreasing revenues could be a concern for the Commission in the
future.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2014 with an operating loss of $5,708. After factoring in
the reserve expense of $53,500, the Commission’s total loss was $59,208. Fiscal year 2013 was the
first year in over five years that the Commission did not realize a net gain.
The ability of the Commission to continue to retain more cash each year is dependent on
whether they are proactive in holding down spending on operations and continue to bring in license
revenues at increasing levels, thus making funds available to set aside each year for future liabilities
and ongoing oyster programs. The Commission closed fiscal year 2014 with a cash balance of
$580,235, which was two percent below fiscal year 2013 levels. The cash balance includes $242,788
in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts and a separate Virginia investment pool
account for retiree health care reserves, with a balance of $298,941 as of June 30, 2014. Both of
these accounts are restricted and can not be used to fund operations. The Commission has
traditionally maintained sufficient operating cash to cover two to three months of expenses. Average
monthly expenses have increased by approximately ten percent causing the drop in cash balance

and reducing the Commission’s operating coverage to one-half month. The Executive Secretary and
the Board will need to monitor this situation and make changes in operations if it continues.

The Honorable Terence R. McAuliffe
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable John C. Watkins
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2014. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial
transactions in the Commission’s financial system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal
controls, test compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and
review corrective actions of audit findings from prior year reports.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed
to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements.

--- Page 13 ---
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent
of our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles,
classes of transactions, and account balances.
Capital assets Cash receipting
Contractual services expenses License revenues
Payroll expenses Federal grant revenues and expenses
Appropriations
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate,
had been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance
with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit
procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and
contracts, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We tested transactions and performed
analytical procedures, including budgetary and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with
outside parties.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts
recorded and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The Commission records its financial
transactions on the cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other
than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial
information presented in this report came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted certain matters involving internal control that require management’s attention and
corrective action. These matters are described in the section entitled “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.”
The Commission has not taken adequate corrective action with respect to audit findings
reported in the prior year and these are repeated in this letter.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on May 28, 2015. Management’s response to
the findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did
not audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
