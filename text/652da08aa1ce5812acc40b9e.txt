INTRODUCTION
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Thank you for the opportunity to present the results of our review of the audit reports
submitted by each local government for the year ended June 30, 2022, which are summarized
in our report entitled Review of Local Government Audit Reports dated August 18, 2023. For
the 198 audit reports due, we found that the local governments have generally complied with
generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards. Additionally, local
governments generally appeared to be in good financial condition at that time. When areas of
noncompliance or potential financial problems were noted, we sent letters describing the
conditions to the governments and, when appropriate, to their auditors in an effort to ensure the
conditions do not recur. Our presentation will address the following areas:
1. Overview of the local government auditing process
2. Problems disclosed by our review of local government audits
3. Follow-up action taken on problems
4. Concluding comments
OVERVIEW
Generally, each county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district located in Maryland is
required by law to have an annual audit. Based on the provisions of Title 16 of the Local Government
Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, each local government is required to have its financial
statements audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. This law also requires that the financial statements be presented in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the results of the audits be
submitted to the Office of Legislative Audits.
Most local governments must file their reports on or before October 31 for the preceding
fiscal year ended June 30; however, local governments whose populations exceed 400,000, and
certain other counties, must file on or before December 31 of each year. In addition, extensions
may be granted to local governments for valid reasons. By law, certain small governments may
request a waiver of the annual filing requirement and instead only have an audit once every four
years. Fourteen local governments requested, and were granted, waivers of the annual filing
requirement for 2022.
As provided for under the law, we have issued audit guidelines that address the basic
requirements that must be met by the local governments and their independent auditors. While the
independent auditors determine the specific procedures necessary in each audit, the guidelines are
intended to help ensure that a minimum acceptable level of quality is maintained for audits and
financial reports of local governments.
The Office of Legislative Audits performs a desk review of each audit report to identify
areas of noncompliance by using a quality control checklist for government audits published by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For example, we generally determine
1

whether the auditor's report was presented in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, whether the local government's financial statements were presented in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and whether financial statement disclosures were
adequate.
Our desk review also includes a review to identify noncompliance with certain State laws,
such as Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the Annotated Code of Maryland which
requires all deposits held in banks by local governments be insured or otherwise collateralized.
Additionally, our desk review includes a basic financial analysis of each local government. This
analysis includes a review of various financial trends and ratios (for example, ratio of general fund
balance to annual expenditures) to provide some insight regarding potential financial problems at the
local government level.
Upon completion of each year's review, we prepare a report summarizing the areas of
noncompliance with the audit guidelines (for example, departures from generally accepted
accounting principles) or with State law (for example, uncollateralized cash deposits). In
addition, when applicable, our report discloses potential financial problems at the local
government level such as deficit general fund balances and unfavorable financial trends and
ratios. This summary report is submitted to the Comptroller of Maryland and the Executive
Director of the Department of Legislative Services, as required by law, as well as other
interested parties.
Finally, State law requires applicable counties to file reports with our Office on their
reviews of financial reports and audits of special taxing districts created by the counties. Our
annual summary reports also include the results of our reviews of such financial information on
county-created special taxing districts.
PROBLEMS DISCLOSED
As reflected on Exhibit A, page 1, most local governments have substantially complied
with standards over the past several years. However, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, our
review disclosed that 37 out of the 198 local government reports due (or 19 percent) contained
areas of noncompliance with the audit guidelines. These areas of noncompliance were not of such
an extent so as to cast doubt on the reliability of the underlying financial statements. The
percentage of local government reports with areas of noncompliance slightly increased from
approximately 16 percent in 2021.
In addition, our review disclosed areas of noncompliance with State law for 10 local
governments that had unsecured cash deposits. Additionally, our review disclosed one local
government with a potential financial problem during fiscal year 2022. See Exhibit A, page 2
for a summary of these areas and problems over the past several years. Some local governments
had more than one area of noncompliance with the guidelines.
The more significant and frequent problems disclosed by our review were as follows:
Timeliness:
1. Local governments did not timely file an audit report as required or failed to do so.

As of July 17, 2023, nineteen local governments were delinquent in filing audit one or
more audit reports as required by the Local Government Article of the Annotated
Code of Maryland.

Auditor's Work:
2. The auditors’ reports for seven local governments were not presented in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards.
Qualified/ Adverse/ Disclaimer of Opinion:
3. The auditor’s report for one local government contained a qualified opinion for two
opinion units. The auditor’s report for a different local government contained a
disclaimer of opinion over the local government as a whole.
Local Government Financial Presentation:
4. Financial statements submitted by thirteen local governments included inappropriate
financial statement presentation.
5. Financial statements for three local governments lacked adequate disclosures in the
statements and/or accompanying notes.
Compliance:
6. We noted that ten local governments had unsecured cash deposits in eleven reports we
reviewed. In most cases, the amount of cash not secured was small in relation to the
local governments' total assets.
3

--- Page 5 ---
Potential Financial Issues:
7. One local government with a potential financial problem was identified. Specifically,
the auditor's report for the Upper Potomac River Commission — Waste Treatment
Plant Fund included an emphasis paragraph describing an uncertainty regarding the
Fund's ability to continue as a going concern. The notes to the Fund's financial
statements stated that the Fund's management is in the process of addressing how it
will fulfill the Fund's obligations, given its economic dependence on a private
corporation.
FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
A letter describing the areas of noncompliance with the audit guidelines noted during our
review was sent to each local government and its independent auditor. The letters requested that the
matters be examined to avoid a recurrence in subsequent audits.
The local government that failed to file audit reports for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022
was reported to the Executive Director of the Department of Legislative Services. If these reports are
not filed, the Comptroller of Maryland, acting upon the advice of the Executive Director, is
authorized by law to discontinue the payment of all funds, grants, or State aid to which the local
governments are entitled.
For areas of noncompliance with State law pertaining to unsecured cash deposits, our
Office requested the applicable local governments to provide written descriptions of the actions
to be taken to eliminate the conditions, when appropriate. We reviewed and evaluated the
responses to these requests, received to date, and found the indicated actions sufficient.
Additionally, as requested by the Committee, when letters were sent to local governments
regarding noncompliance with State laws, copies of the letters were also sent to the appropriate
members of the Maryland General Assembly.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the Office of Legislative Audits functions in an oversight capacity by issuing
audit guidelines, reviewing local government audit reports for compliance with standards and
regulations, and notifying the local governments and their auditors of any deficiencies noted. We
believe that these efforts have helped improve the quality of audits and have promoted fiscal
accountability among local governments in Maryland.
To further improve the quality of local government audits, we participate in various
efforts to make technical information available to local governments, and respond to technical
inquiries from local governments and their auditors.
We will be happy to answer any questions you may have on this presentation.
