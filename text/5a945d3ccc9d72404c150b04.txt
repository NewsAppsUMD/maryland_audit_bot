Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closeout transactions that have not been previously recorded in the
State’s accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR).
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the CAFR. In its
audit report dated December 17, 2014, applicable to the fiscal year ended June 30,
2014, the firm stated that the State’s basic financial statements presented fairly, in
all material respects, the respective financial position of the State of Maryland as
of June 30, 2014, and the respective changes in the financial position and cash
flows, for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (referred to as GAAP).
The State’s CAFR states that, on a budgetary basis, the General Fund had an
unencumbered balance of approximately $147.6 million as of June 30, 2014. This
represents a decrease of approximately $354.3 million from the balance reported
at the preceding fiscal year-end ($501.9 million). The CAFR also states that the
State Reserve (Revenue Stabilization Account) balance totaled $772.5 million as
of June 30, 2014.
The budgetary General Fund balance does not reflect the effect of year-end
GAAP adjustments made to the State’s financial statements that were prepared on
a modified accrual basis of accounting. Certain GAAP adjustments, if recognized
on the budgetary basis, would have reduced the aforementioned unencumbered
budgetary General Fund balance of $147.6 million. For example, one GAAP
adjustment reduced the Fund balance by $443.6 million for State and local
income tax collections that were recorded as revenue for fiscal year 2014 but were
applicable to future fiscal years. This adjustment was $202.6 million smaller than
a similar adjustment made for the fiscal year 2013 CAFR. Other GAAP
adjustments totaling $49.6 million were made for liabilities incurred by State
agencies during fiscal year 2014 for which general fund appropriations were not
available to finance the expenditures (see Exhibit 2).

Introduction, Objectives, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2014. This review was conducted under the authority of the
State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
The objective of our review was to determine whether budget closeout
transactions, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, were properly supported and
made in accordance with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting
policies.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end transactions for 21
Departments and independent agencies to ascertain if the transactions were
properly supported and made in accordance with State budgetary laws,
regulations, and accounting policies. We reviewed, on a limited basis,
transactions processed subsequent to June 30, 2014 to determine if the
transactions were properly recorded (such as charged or credited to the proper
fiscal year).
As part of our current review, we contacted various officials of State agencies, as
well as the independent accounting firm under contract with the State to express
an opinion on its financial statements. Our review excluded public colleges and
universities and transactions processed through the Transportation Trust Fund
because the related financial activity does not involve the State’s General Fund
and/or because agencies have the authority to retain unspent funds at year-end.
Our conclusions for the aforementioned objective are contained on page 9 of this
report.
We also assessed the status of the 10 issues (appearing in six findings) identified
in our January 13, 2014 report entitled Statewide Review of Budget Closeout
Transactions for Fiscal Year 2013. We determined that 3 of the 10 issues had not
been resolved and are repeated in this report (see Exhibit 1).
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
7

reported. We advised the appropriate agencies of our findings. Formal responses
were not requested since this report contains no recommendations. Our fieldwork
was conducted during the period from October 2014 to January 2015.

Findings
Conclusion
Our review of State agencies’ budget closeout transactions disclosed that such
transactions were generally properly supported and made in accordance with State
budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies. However, we determined
that five departments or units thereof were not in compliance primarily because
certain year-end transactions were not properly recorded, could not be
substantiated, or did not comply with budget closeout requirements.
Revenue Transactions
Three agencies recorded unsubstantiated revenues to offset various fund deficits.
Specifically, the agencies recorded federal fund and reimbursable revenues
totaling approximately $6.8 million to cover expenditures even though there was
no indication that these revenues were available. The use of general funds will
likely be required to eliminate the deficits resulting from these transactions.
Expenditure Transactions
Two agencies did not report certain liabilities to the Comptroller of Maryland –
General Accounting Division (GAD). One agency did not report a federal
liability of approximately $13.7 million attributable to the disallowance of certain
claims. The other agency had unprovided for general fund payables of $10.8
million (that is, accounts payable which were not recorded in the budgetary
closeout process due to a lack of available appropriation). GAD requires
unprovided for payables to be reported during the year-end closeout process. In
addition, three state agencies reported a total of $49.6 million in unprovided for
general fund payables as of June 30, 2014 (Exhibit 2). The expenditures related
to these unprovided for payables will have to be funded with subsequent year
appropriations (or through a deficiency appropriation).
A summary of our findings, by agency, is included in Exhibit 1.

Revenue Transactions
Finding 1
The recovery of recorded federal and reimbursable fund revenues totaling
approximately $6.8 million is uncertain.
Analysis
The Department of Aging (DOA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA)
and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) could not substantiate their
ability to collect revenues of approximately $3.8 million, $1.6 million, and $1.4
million, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. If these agencies are unable to recover
these funds, general funds may be needed to eliminate the resulting deficits.
DOA
DOA recorded federal fund and reimbursable fund revenue transactions of
approximately $2.9 million and $900,000, respectively, at June 30, 2014. These
revenue transactions (that is, federal fund receivables and receivables from
another State agency) related to federal fund expenditures for the Medicaid
Waiver and the Money Follows the Person grant that were incurred during fiscal
year 2014 and prior years. However, as of January 12, 2015, requests for
reimbursement of these expenditures had not been prepared. This issue, as related
to federal fund revenues, has been commented upon in our two preceding
budgetary closeout reports. In this regard, at June 30, 2013, DOA recorded
unsubstantiated federal fund revenues of $3.7 million related to similar federal
fund expenditures.
DVA
Federal fund revenue transactions totaling approximately $1.6 million were
primarily recorded on DVA’s behalf by the Comptroller of Maryland – General
Accounting Division (GAD) to eliminate deficit balances that existed in several
federal programs as of June 30, 2014. Officials at DVA and GAD could not
provide any documentation supporting that the year-end recorded revenues would
be received. According to GAD, these deficits resulted from federal fund
expenditures incurred during prior years. This issue has been commented upon in
our three preceding budgetary closeout reports.
DNR
DNR recorded year-end federal fund revenue transactions totaling approximately
$1.4 million, related to federal fund grant expenditures, which will not be
received. Officials at DNR explained that the related grants had closed prior to
DNR requesting reimbursement and that no extension requests can be submitted;
therefore, DNR does not anticipate collecting these funds. Since federal funds are
10

--- Page 13 ---
not available to cover federal fund expenditures that had been previously
recorded, other funds will be needed to eliminate these resulting deficits.
Expenditure Transactions
Finding 2
The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had an unreported liability
to the federal government related to certain disallowed claims.
Analysis
The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has a liability to the federal
government of approximately $20.6 million for disallowed claims related to
Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) residential service. During
the closeout process, DDA encumbered, with the approval of the Department of
Budget and Management, $6.9 million of fiscal year 2014 general funds to make
the first of three annual payments to return funds for the disallowed claims. The
remaining liability of $13.7 million was not reported as part of the budget
closeout process. However, GAD recorded a decrease to the General Fund in the
State’s fiscal year 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report to recognize
these disallowances.
As disclosed in our October 2, 2013 fiscal compliance audit report on DDA, DDA
residential service costs totaling approximately $20.6 million were disallowed by
the federal Department of Health and Human Services – Office of the Inspector
General in its September 2013 audit report which recommended that DDA refund
the overbilled amount to the federal government. DDA intends to repay the
disallowed claims over three years using general funds. This issue was
commented upon in our preceding budgetary closeout report.
Finding 3
The Maryland State Department of Education did not report unprovided for
general fund payables of $10.8 million.
Analysis
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) failed to report
unprovided for general fund payables totaling approximately $10.8 million to
GAD, as required by the State’s year-end closeout procedures. According to
MSDE, fiscal year 2014 general fund expenditures for nonpublic placements in its
Students With Disabilities – Aid to Education program totaled $120.6 million
while the related appropriation was only $109.8 million.
