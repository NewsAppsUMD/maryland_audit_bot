Audit Overview
(cid:190) FIA administered a number of assistance programs
with FY 2007 payments of $488 million, including:
(cid:131) Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA), which is
funded by both state and federal funds ($105
million), and
(cid:131) Food Stamps, which is entirely federally-funded
($334 million).
(cid:190) FIA is responsible for recording recipient and
benefit data in the Clients’ Automated Resources
and Eligibility System (CARES). As of June 30,
2007, CARES included more than 800,000
recipient records, including:
(cid:131) 672,000 for Medicaid,
(cid:131) 320,000 for food stamps,
(cid:131) 50,000 for TCA, and
(cid:131) 12,000 for other assistance programs

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Periodic computer matches to detect ineligible
public assistance recipients excluded most
recipients and were often not performed
timely.
(cid:190) Social security numbers were missing for
52,000 public assistance recipients in CARES.
(cid:190) FIA lacked adequate procedures to ensure
that all eligible recipients were referred to the
Disability Entitlement Advocacy Program
whereby all of their benefits would essentially
be paid by the federal government.

Computer Matches
(cid:190) Eight of twelve quarterly computer matches to
detect ineligible recipients were not performed
timely. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) Four matches, including a comparison of
recipients to certain federal employment
records, had not been conducted during
the audit period.
(cid:131) Four other matches, including a
comparison of Maryland recipients to
recipients in neighboring states, had not
been conducted for periods from 9 to 14
months.

Computer Matches (cont.)
(cid:190) Computer matches that were performed during
FY 2006 were not comprehensive. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) Limitations of match software omitted over
90% of the recipient population (match was
limited to 65,000 of 800,000 recipients in
CARES). DHR advised the same match
procedures had been used since June
2003.
(cid:131) Three significant matches involving inmate
and death records that were rerun in June
2007 with the complete population
resulted in 20 times more alerts than the
original matches (2,531 versus 129).

Public Assistance Eligibility
(cid:190) Based on OLA review of CARES, social security
numbers (SSN) were missing or invalid for
52,000 of the 887,000 recipients who had
received assistance benefits during CY 2006.
(Finding 3)
(cid:190) Although federal and state regulations require
disclosure of a SSN by a recipient during the
benefit application process, it is permissible
to still receive benefits upon presenting
evidence that the applicant had applied for a
SSN.

Public Assistance Eligibility (cont.)
(cid:190) A missing SSN impacts the effectiveness of
both DHR’s computer matches with wage
records during the benefit application process
and the aforementioned quarterly matches.
(cid:190) Benefits paid for the recipients with missing
SSNs could be significant. For example, the
majority of recipients on CARES qualify for
Medicaid benefits, which according to DHMH
records averaged $3,600 in general funds per
recipient during FY 2006.

Disability Entitlement Advocacy Program (DEAP)
(cid:190) DEAP assists certain disabled public assistance
recipients in applying for 100% federally-funded
Supplemental Security Income and Social
Security Disability Income, removing them from
joint state/federal funded programs.
(cid:190) A private contractor administers DEAP and
works with the local departments of social
services and FIA in identifying current recipients
who might be eligible for SSI and SSDI. FIA also
pays a fee to the contractor for each individual
it assists in applying for SSI/SSDI.
(cid:190) Procedures were inadequate to ensure that all
potentially SSI/SSDI eligible recipients were
referred to DEAP. (Finding 5)
(cid:190) FIA did not verify the propriety of contractor
billings to ensure that they only contained
individuals actually assisted in the SSI/SSDI
application process. (Finding 6)

Conclusions
(cid:190) FIA should ensure that computer matches
are performed quarterly and include all
public assistance recipients, and that the
results are promptly investigated.
(cid:190) FIA should investigate and resolve all
missing and invalid SSNs and establish a
requirement that recipients who do not
provide valid SSNs within a certain period be
considered ineligible for benefits.
(cid:190) Adequate procedures should be established
to ensure that all eligible customers are
referred to DEAP and that contractor
payments are proper.
