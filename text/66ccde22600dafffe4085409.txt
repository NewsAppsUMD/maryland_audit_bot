Annapolis, Maryland
The Honorable Brooke E. Lierman
Comptroller of Maryland
Ms. Victoria L. Gruber, Executive Director
Department of Legislative Services
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with the Local Government Article, Section 16-307 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, we have performed desk reviews of the audit
reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 filed by each county, incorporated
city or town, and taxing district in Maryland (referred to as local governments).
We also reviewed overdue audit reports for prior fiscal years that were received
over the past year. The desk reviews consisted of assessments of compliance with
certain accounting and auditing standards, evaluations of compliance with certain
State laws, and analyses of selected financial data to identify potential financial
problems.
Most of the financial statements filed by the local governments for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2023, along with the related independent auditors’ reports,
complied with the accounting and auditing standards that we assessed.
Nevertheless, we identified instances of noncompliance with certain requirements
of our audit guidelines, generally accepted accounting principles, and/or generally
accepted auditing standards. We sent letters to 45 local governments (some of
whom had several different instances of non-compliance) and, as applicable, to
their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies disclosed by our
reviews so that corrective actions could be taken to help ensure future
compliance.

--- Page 4 ---
In addition, 40 local governments had not filed audit reports in accordance with
the requirements of State law. For example, as of April 30, 2024, 26 local
governments had not submitted audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2023, which had a statutory filing deadline of October 31, 2023 or December 31,
2023 (based on a jurisdiction’s population size). Additionally, 8 of those 26 local
governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal years ending June 30, 2022; and
2 of those 8 also had not filed its audit report for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2021. As noted later in this report, certain of these local governments submitted
reports after this deadline and will be reviewed in conjunction with our review of
the fiscal year 2024 financial statements.
If a local government does not comply with the audit report filing requirements,
State law provides that the Comptroller of Maryland, on notice from the
Executive Director of the Department of Legislative Services, may order the
discontinuance of all moneys, grants, or State aid to which the local governments
are entitled. Previously, in a separate letter, we notified the Executive Director of
the Department of Legislative Services of the local governments with more than
one fiscal year’s audit report outstanding.
Financial statements submitted by 13 local governments contained disclosures
that cash deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as
required by State law. Additionally, for one local government, the auditor’s
report included an explanatory paragraph describing an uncertainty about its
ability to continue as a going concern. As appropriate, we sent letters to these
local governments, and to their legislative representatives, to communicate their
noncompliance and to request that the local governments advise us of the
corrective actions that will be taken.
Respectfully submitted,
Brian S. Tanen

Introduction and Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires each county, incorporated city or town, and special taxing area
in Maryland (referred to in this report as local governments) to file audit reports
annually or once every four years under specified conditions. There are 23
counties, Baltimore City, 156 incorporated cities and towns, and 14 special taxing
areas in Maryland that fall under the scope of our review. In March 2024 we
advised all local governments of the relevant submission deadlines. Audit
guidelines to provide additional information regarding the accounting, reporting,
and auditing requirements were distributed in July 2023.
Based on current reports, past due reports, and waivers previously granted by this
Office, there were 206 local government audit reports due for our fiscal year 2023
review.1 The reports are to include financial statements, with accompanying
notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions as to whether the financial
statements are fairly presented. The financial statements are required to be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and audited
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-307 of the Code requires the Office of
Legislative Audits (OLA) to perform a desk review of each local government’s
annual audit report for compliance with generally accepted accounting principles
and auditing standards. As part of the desk review process, we also addressed
other attributes as described below. Section 16-308 of the Article specifies the
reporting and review requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by
the counties (in general, the difference between a special taxing district and a
special taxing area relates to the party responsible for monitoring). The
applicable county is responsible for monitoring each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to OLA. Generally, OLA also reviews the counties’ monitoring
of the districts’ reports.
Our current desk review included all reports for fiscal year 2023 received as of
April 30, 2024, as well as any reports received as of that date for prior years, such
as any delinquent reports received. Any reports due but received after that date
have been classified as not received for purposes of this year’s review, and will be
included in our next review, which will be for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2024.
1 As noted in the “Results of Desk Review” section of this report, not all reports due this year were
submitted.

In addition to the fiscal year 2023 reports that were received from the counties,
incorporated cities and towns, and special taxing areas as of the aforementioned
date, we also received and reviewed the following reports that were received over
the last year.
 One fiscal year 2020 report (City of Seat Pleasant)
 Five fiscal year 2021 reports (Dorchester County, Town of Deer Park, Town
of Forest Heights, City of Hyattsville, and Town of Middletown)
 Eleven fiscal year 2022 reports (Town of Berwyn Heights, Town of
Burkittsville, Town of Capitol Heights, Town of Charlestown, Town of Deer
Park, Town of East New Market, Town of Greensboro, Town of Indian Head,
Town of Middletown, Village of Port Tobacco, and Town of Princess Anne)
The desk reviews consisted of reviewing each audit report in order to accomplish
the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and certain
accounting and auditing standards pertaining to the presentation of the
financial statements and auditors’ reports.
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits, timely filing of audit reports).
 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances or unfavorable trends and ratios, based on analyses of financial
data over the most recent five-year period (July 1, 2018 through June 30,
2023).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2023 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had received all required
reports from the districts and reviewed the reports submitted for compliance with
the provisions of the law and to identify instances in which required reports were
not submitted.
At the conclusion of our review, we sent letters to applicable local governments
and their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies disclosed during
the review, so that corrective actions can be taken to help ensure future
compliance. Additionally, as appropriate, we sent letters to local governments,
and to their legislative representatives, to communicate certain noncompliance
with State law or potential financial problems. For these issues, we asked the
local governments to advise us of corrective actions that will be taken.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
Finding 1
Forty local governments had not filed the required audit reports and/or had
filed after the required filing date.
Forty local governments had not filed the required audit reports and/or had filed
after the required filing date. As of April 30, 2024, 26 local governments had not
filed the current year’s audit report as required by the Local Government Article
of the Annotated Code of Maryland including eight that remained delinquent in
filing the required report for one or more prior years (see Figure 1 on next page).
Furthermore, 24 local governments submitted 27 audit reports after the filing date
required by law. The submission of audit reports after the filing date in the law
was also noted for 11 of these 24 local governments during one or more of our
preceding reviews (see Figure 1 on next page).
The failure of a local government to file an audit report, or a delay in filing,
results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The Local Government
Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of Maryland generally requires
audit reports to be filed on or before October 31 after the close of the fiscal year,
or on or before December 31 after the close of the fiscal year for those local
governments with a population of more than 400,000. As previously noted, we
gave local governments until April 30, 2024 before classifying a report due as not
submitted.

* The audit report for this fiscal year was subsequently submitted after the April 30, 2024 cut

review of fiscal year 2024 audit reports.
** As noted in Finding 2, the auditor was unable to express an opinion on the Town’s financial
statements for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. While the submission of the audit report satisfies
the technical requirement of the law, we believe the Town could be treated as a non-filer for
these years because the financial statements may not be able to be relied upon.
Source: Local Government Audit Reports
The towns of Barnesville, Barton, Brookview, Burkittsville, Church Creek,
Eldorado, Galestown, Goldsboro, Henderson, Highland Beach, Hillsboro,
Marydel, Queen Anne, Templeville, and the Village of Port Tobacco previously
requested and were granted waivers from filing audit reports. Local governments
granted waivers are required to meet the conditions for filing an audit report every
fourth year as provided for under the Local Government Article, Section 16-305
of the Code and, depending on the waiver period, will be required to file its next
audit report for either fiscal year 2024, 2025, or 2026.
Budget language adopted during previous sessions of the Maryland General
Assembly resulted in the withholding of transportation aid from certain local
governments pending receipt of their delinquent audit reports. Furthermore, the
failure to file a required report with the Department of Legislative Services for
three successive years provides the Department’s Executive Director with
reasonable cause to suppose that the municipality is no longer actively operating
under its charter, which could cause the municipality to have its charter repealed.
To that end, we have reported the failure of the City of Seat Pleasant and the
Town of Sudlersville to file the required reports for the fiscal years ending June
30, 2021, 2022, and 2023 to the Executive Director.

Finding 2
The auditor’s report for one local government contained a disclaimer of
opinion on the financial statements.
The auditor’s fiscal year 2022 report for the Town of Princess Anne contained a
disclaimer of opinion on the financial statements. A disclaimer of opinion is
issued because the auditor was unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit
evidence in order to express an opinion on the financial statements. While the
submission of the audit report satisfies the technical requirement of the law, the
inability to express an opinion diminishes the value of the audit because the
financial statements may not be able to be relied upon. This area of
noncompliance was previously noted for the Town’s fiscal year 2021 financial
statements. Furthermore, as noted in Finding 1, as of April 30, 2024, the Town
had not submitted a report for fiscal year 2023.
Although required by our audit guidelines, the auditor for the Town of Princess
Anne did not submit a separate letter to the Office of Legislative Audits (OLA)
explaining the reason why an unqualified opinion could not be expressed and the
Town management’s plan to rectify the problem to enable the auditor to express
an unqualified opinion in the future.
Finding 3
Auditors’ reports for three local governments were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for three local governments were not presented in accordance
with certain generally accepted auditing standards as required. Specifically, in
one report the auditors did not express an opinion on all opinion units or financial
statements as required, and in two other reports the auditors did not include all the
basic elements of an audit report in accordance with auditing standards. For one
of these local governments, the same deficiency was cited during our preceding
year’s review.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires that audits be performed in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. These standards require, in part, that the auditor express an
opinion(s) as to whether the basic financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the respective financial position, the respective changes in
financial position, and cash flows, where applicable, of the local government in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Financial Statements
Finding 4
The financial statements submitted by 17 local governments did not meet
certain requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 17 local governments included a total of 18
instances in which certain requirements of generally accepted accounting
principles were not met. Furthermore, the deficiencies noted in the financial
statements for 2 of the local governments were also noted during our preceding
year's review. A summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of
instances is shown in Figure 2.

Finding 5
Financial statements, accompanying notes, and required supplementary
information in four audit reports related to three local governments did not
include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or
disclosed in the accompanying notes, or the required supplementary information,
for four audit reports from three local governments. Adequate disclosure is
necessary to facilitate the understanding of and to provide for fair presentation of
the financial information. The financial statements of three of these local
governments included a deficiency that was also cited during our review of the
preceding year’s financial statements. A summary of the areas of insufficient
disclosure and the corresponding number of instances is shown in Figure 3.

The Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires that deposits with financial institutions by local governmental
units be fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes the risk of loss of
deposits in the event the financial institution defaults. In addition, this law
requires that collateral be of the types specified in the State Finance and
Procurement Article, Section 6-202 of the Code.
Potential Financial Problems
Finding 7
One local government audit report disclosed potential financial problems
resulting in uncertainty regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.
The audit report for the Upper Potomac River Commission – Waste Treatment
Plant, Trunk Sewer and Municipal Connecting System Fund (Fund), disclosed
potential financial problems resulting in uncertainty regarding its ability to
continue as a going concern. Specifically, the auditor’s report referenced the
Fund’s notes to the financial statements which stated the Fund received 100
percent of operating revenues from a corporation which closed its paper mill on
June 30, 2019, which until that time operated on the Potomac River. The notes
also state that in August 2023, the Fund amended its agreement with the
corporation allowing for $2,500,000 of continuing treatment services for the
period of January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025.
The notes stated that the Fund management is in the process of addressing how it
will fulfill the Fund’s obligations, given its economic dependence on the
corporation. This Fund had an unrestricted net position deficit of $1,251,528,
which was partially offset by net investment in capital assets of $856,825 leaving
the Fund with a net position deficit of $394,703 as of June 30, 2023. A similar
condition has been noted in regard to the Commission’s financial statements in
each fiscal year since 2019.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Article,
Section 16-306 of the Code. Section 16-308 of this Article requires that certain
types of special taxing districts (created by a county) file annual audited or
unaudited financial reports with the county in which the districts are located not
later than 90 days after the close of the fiscal year, in accordance with the rules
13

--- Page 16 ---
and regulations established by the applicable county. The applicable county is
responsible for reviewing each district’s compliance with the applicable
provisions of the law and for submitting copies of these reports to the Office of
Legislative Audits. For fiscal year 2023, there were 92 special taxing districts, of
which 79 had activity to report. The required reports had been filed timely with
the applicable county for these 79 special taxing districts.
