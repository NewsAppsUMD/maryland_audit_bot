COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and improve the fishery
resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership consists of eight
Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
As shown in Table 1 below, when compared to the previous fiscal year, Commission revenues
increased by 14 percent; expenses increased by eight percent; and net income increased overall by 55
percent. The Commission’s revenue increase was due primarily to a one-time grant of $125,000 from
Maryland and an increase in oyster license sales. The increase in expenses resulted from an increase in
oyster planting and federal grant activity.

In addition to its operating cash, the Commission has several reserve accounts. The Commission
has $231,271 in the Virginia and Maryland local government investment pool accounts earmarked to
fund future oyster work under the Oyster Management Reserve and Rotational Oyster Harvest
programs. The Commission also has $630,481 in a separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree
health care reserves. The retiree healthcare account is managed by a trust and legally cannot be used
to fund operations. The Commission contributes to the retiree healthcare account annually based on
recommendations from an actuarial periodic funding study.

The Honorable Glenn Youngkin
Governor of Virginia
Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
Mr. Ronald Owens, Executive Secretary
Potomac River Fisheries Commission
Commissioners
Potomac River Fisheries Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2024. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commissions’ financial system; review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls; test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and review corrective
actions of audit findings from prior year reports. See the Findings Summary included in the Appendix
for a listing of prior findings and the status of follow-up on management’s corrective action.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.

We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances:
Federal grant revenues and expenses
Contractual services expenses
Payroll expenses
Appropriations
Cash receipts
Capital assets
Information system security
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses, and tested details of transactions to achieve our audit objectives. We also confirmed
bank balances with outside parties.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The financial information presented in this report
came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted no matters involving internal control and its operation that we consider necessary to
be reported to management. The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are
required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.
The Commission has taken adequate corrective action with respect to a prior audit finding
identified as complete in the Findings Summary included in the Appendix.
