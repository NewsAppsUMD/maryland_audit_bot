Background Information
The Judiciary is responsible for the administration of justice through the operation
of a system of courts under the Judicial Branch of State government. The courts
consist of the Court of Appeals, the Court of Special Appeals, circuit courts, and
the District Court of Maryland. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals is the
administrative head of the State’s judicial system. The Chief Judge appoints the
State court administrator as head of the Administrative Office of the Courts to
carry out the administrative duties which include data analysis, personnel policies,
education, and training for judicial personnel.
The District Court consists of 34 court houses located throughout the 23 counties
and Baltimore City. The 23 counties and Baltimore City are grouped into 12
districts for administrative purposes. See page 8 for the composition of the
districts. The District Court handles the following types of cases: civil lawsuits
up to $30,000; landlord-tenant disputes; criminal misdemeanors and certain
felonies; motor vehicle violations; replevin claims, which seek the recovery of
property or goods; and bail and preliminary hearings for any crime charged in
Maryland. Our audit scope was limited to civil lawsuits.
The Civil Online System automates the clerical processing of civil cases filed in
the District Court, and serves as the case management system. Civil complaints
filed by plaintiffs with the district courts are initially reviewed to ensure the
filings are complete and the required fees have been remitted. Each complaint is
assigned a case number and then the case information is recorded into the System.
Once the information is recorded, a summons can be printed, which is either
mailed by the court, or delivered by a private process server or the sheriff. The
system is also used to record case activity, to notify parties as necessary, and to
generate management reports.

Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Scope and Objectives
We conducted a performance audit to determine the length of time taken by the
district courts to record civil complaints into the Judiciary’s case management
system and to determine if the Judiciary had established standards for the length
of time that it should take the district courts to initially record complaints into the
case management system.
This audit was conducted in response to a request from the Joint Audit
Committee. We conducted the audit under the authority of the State Government
Article, Section 2-1220 of the Annotated Code of Maryland and performed it in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives.
Methodology
To accomplish our objectives, we obtained a data file from the Judiciary of civil
cases recorded on its case management system for complaints received between
July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011 for the purpose of determining the time taken to
record the complaint into the system, once the filing was deemed complete. We
performed tests, based on non-statistical sampling, of the data for the four largest
districts (which accounted for 63 percent of the cases) and determined that the
data were sufficiently reliable for our audit purposes. The data consisted of the
date that the complaint was received by the court and the date that it was entered
into the case management system. We verified the complaint receipt date by
examining the date stamp date on the complaint form. The system entry date was
automatically assigned by the case management system. Using the data we
calculated the processing times for each of the 12 districts, which included all 23
counties and Baltimore City.
We also contacted the National Center for State Courts to inquire about civil case
time entry standards in other states. In addition, we contacted other states’ court
officials and inquired about any standards for the length of time to record civil
cases into case management systems. Finally, we interviewed officials at the
Judiciary and at selected district court locations regarding the procedures for
processing civil complaints.

Our fieldwork was conducted between October and December 2011. The
Judiciary’s response to our findings and recommendations is included as an
appendix to this report. As prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2-
1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we will advise the Judiciary regarding
the results of our review of its response.

Conclusions
We concluded that the time it takes to record civil complaints into the Judiciary’s
case management system varies among the districts and that no timeliness
standards or formal tracking mechanisms had been established to monitor
processing times. Due to the variations, the Judiciary should establish time
processing standards, monitor performance, investigate the causes for delays, and
ensure appropriate actions are taken to address delays. For example, the average
length of time to record the complaints in District 5 during fiscal year 2011 was
over 20 days, with almost 45 percent of the cases taking in excess of 20 days to
record. The statewide average for all other districts was only 6 days.

We inquired at the three districts which, on average, had the highest delays as to
the reasons for the delays in initially recording civil complaints into the case
management systems. The districts attributed the delays to temporary staffing
shortages. For example, management of District 5 advised that more than one-
half of the staff responsible for data entry of civil cases had been on sick leave for
extended periods during fiscal year 2011. These three districts attempted to
address their situations by either requesting additional employees, assigning
supervisors to process cases, paying overtime and/or by reallocating workloads
among other employees. Delays in recording complaints into the system cause a
corresponding delay in setting a trial date, issuing a summons to the defendant,
and adjudicating the case.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that the Judiciary
a. investigate the reasons for delays in initially recording civil case filings
into the case management system, and
b. ensure that appropriate measures are taken to address such delays.
Finding 2
The Judiciary had not established processing time standards for district
courts to record civil complaints into the case management system nor
monitored the district courts’ processing performance.
Analysis
Our audit disclosed that the Judiciary had not established time standards
specifying how soon after the receipt of a civil case filing the courts should be
recording the information into the case management system. Also, the Judiciary
did not monitor the length of time taken by the courts to record the information
into the system. Without standards, neither the district courts nor the court
administration has formally established expectations for evaluating performance
in this area and for taking appropriate actions to improve performance when
necessary.
We consulted with other states’ court administrators and national bodies such as
the National Center for State Courts to determine if standards had been
established or recommended for initial entry of civil claims into automated
systems. Our inquiries did not disclose any widely recognized or definitive
timeframes recommended for this area. The general response we received was
that cases should be recorded as soon as possible and without delay. Accordingly,
actual standards for each organization would need to be established based on its
specific procedures, processes, needs, and expectations in the circumstances.

In 2001, the Judiciary developed case processing standards which establish the
length of time to record a judgment in a civil case, measured from the date that
the defendant is served with a summons. The Judiciary utilizes these standards as
part of its Managing for Results measures and submits a report annually to the
budget committees on its progress in meeting the standards. However, starting
from the point a summons is served excludes from measurement a portion of the
entire process, thereby precluding a complete assessment of case processing
timeliness.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that the Judiciary
a. establish time standards for district courts to record civil case filings into
the case management system, and
b. monitor the district courts’ performance against the established
standards.
