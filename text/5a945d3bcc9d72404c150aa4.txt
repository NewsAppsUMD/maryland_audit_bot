Ladies and Gentlemen:
We conducted a performance audit of certain aspects of the Department of
State Police’s Aviation Command helicopter operations. The Command’s
primary responsibilities are to provide emergency medical transport
(medevac) and certain law enforcement operations throughout Maryland. The
Command operates its 12 helicopters out of eight bases throughout the State.
The Command consists of 161 employees who are extremely dedicated to
accomplishing their mission of providing timely medevac services and
meeting law enforcement needs. The Command is highly regarded
throughout the country and it has an extraordinary helicopter safety record.
Over a five-year period, helicopters were used almost exclusively for critical
missions.
Overall, the audit identified a number of issues impacting management’s
oversight and the efficiency and effectiveness of the Command’s operations.
Management’s ability to make informed decisions pertaining to helicopter
availability and maintenance was severely hindered by the lack of reliable and
extensive data systems. Based on our analysis, we determined that, on 51
days during fiscal year 2007, fewer than 8 of the 12 helicopters were
available on those days due to maintenance issues. During that year, 6
helicopters were unavailable for more than 120 days. Furthermore, the
Command was unable to identify the cost per flight hour, including the
maintenance costs for each repair, and the cumulative repair costs per
helicopter. Without this information, management is unable to reliably assess
the efficiency of its maintenance operation, including determining the optimal
number of staff and when the use of contractors for repairs is most beneficial.
There are several staffing-related issues that impact operations. The most
significant issue involves turnover in key positions, such as senior
management, pilots, and maintenance technicians, with the primary causes
being the Command’s management reassignment practices and
comparatively low salaries, especially for pilots and technicians. Finally,
although the Department reported that almost 95 percent of the Command’s
medevac missions during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 were completed within

one hour (that is, the “Golden Hour”), we were unable to verify the reliability of
these results due to data control issues.
An executive summary of our findings can be found on page 7, and our audit
scope, objectives, and methodology are explained on page 27. We wish to
acknowledge the cooperation extended to us by the Command during our
audit.

Executive Summary
We conducted a performance audit of certain aspects of the Department of
State Police’s Aviation Command helicopter operations. This audit was
requested by the Joint Audit Committee, which also defined the scope and
objectives. The purpose of this audit was fourfold:
1. To determine the use and availability of the Command’s helicopter
fleet, which consists of 12 American Eurocopter Dauphins, based at
eight locations (referred to as sections) throughout Maryland
2. To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the Command’s
helicopter maintenance and inspection operations
3. To evaluate the adequacy of the Command’s staffing structure,
personnel practices, and training policies
4. To determine the reliability of the Command’s “Golden Hour”
managing for results performance measure that identifies the
timeliness of patient helicopter transport to trauma centers
During the course of our audit, Command employees demonstrated exemplary
dedication and pride in their work, and a high level of commitment to their
primary mission of providing emergency medical transport (medevac) and
airborne law enforcement services. The Command is highly regarded
throughout the country and, with respect to the operation of its helicopter
fleet, possesses an impeccable safety record. Specifically, the current
helicopter fleet (acquired from 1989 to 1999) has flown almost 90,000 hours
without a National Transportation Safety Board reportable accident, injury, or
fatality, giving the Command a safety record well above the national average
for emergency medical services. For fiscal year 2007, the State’s financial
records indicated that the Command’s expenditures totaled $22.3 million,
including approximately 59 percent for salaries and related benefits for 161
positions.
Overall, our audit disclosed that management lacks reliable and extensive
data systems needed to better manage critical aspects of its operations, such
as helicopter availability and maintenance. Better systems are needed to
determine the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance operations, and to
help minimize helicopter downtime. In addition, employee turnover at key
positions is a significant issue. Due to data reliability issues, we were unable
to assess the reliability of Command’s “Golden Hour” performance. As a
result of the shortcomings regarding operational data, we spent a
Office of 7
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 10 ---
considerable amount of effort compiling the data presented in this report.
Regarding Objective 1, we determined that, on average, approximately 97
percent of the helicopter missions that occurred over the five-year period
ended June 30, 2007 were related to critical missions, such as to provide
medevac services. We concluded that the use of helicopters for non-critical
missions was not significant and, as such, did not appear to have a
detrimental impact on the Command’s operations.
Since helicopter downtime can have a significant impact on the Command’s
ability to perform missions, we also determined the potential impact of
downtime on its operations. Although the Command tracks section downtime
(that is, its duration and the reasons why any one of the eight helicopter
sections is not available for missions during scheduled hours of operation),
the downtime database suffers from reliability issues. Independent
verifications were not performed to verify downtime recorded in the database
and, as a result, errors were identified. Also, the Command did not track
downtime by helicopter, which would be helpful for fleet management
purposes.
We compiled data from several available sources, such as maintenance work
orders, to estimate the impact of maintenance on helicopter availability during
fiscal year 2007. Although the Command has 12 helicopters, we estimated
that, for 51 days, fewer than 8 of the Command’s helicopters were available,
meaning that at least one of the eight sections did not have an available
helicopter on those days. We could not determine the extent to which the lack
of available helicopters on any given day affected the Command’s mission
capabilities. However, according to the Command, when only seven
helicopters are available (in 42 of the 51 days), it usually temporarily closes
one particular section which, if necessary, can generally be served by other
sections or by an aviation unit of a federal government agency. In addition,
the services of commercial transport providers can be obtained. Our analysis
also indicated that 6 of the helicopters were individually unavailable for more
than 120 days during fiscal year 2007. Some of the factors contributing to
the lack of available helicopters relate to the findings identified in Objective 2.
Regarding Objective 2, we determined the Command lacked certain essential
data to assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its maintenance
operations. The Command did not compile or track data to determine the
direct operating costs per flight hour, including the actual maintenance labor
hours spent for individual inspection and repair tasks. These data are
necessary to assess whether maintenance tasks are efficiently performed,
whether the current staffing level is sufficient, and whether it is more cost-
effective to use contractors for certain types of repairs. Based on available
8 O f f i c e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 11 ---
data, it appears that certain inspections are completed much more timely by
outside contractors than by in-house maintenance staff. However, it is
unclear whether this is due to staffing issues, delays in receiving or under-
stocking necessary parts, or some other factor(s). Because of the lack of
Command cost and labor-tracking data, the cost-effectiveness of using
contractors could not be assessed.
The Command did not adequately use automated inventory system features
to ensure that parts were pre-ordered and stocked to minimize downtime
resulting from inspections and maintenance. We estimated that, for 20
selected critical parts (such as rotor masts), the Command was under-stocked
for 7 of the critical parts based on estimated flight hours of the fleet. It is
imperative that the Command use available information to ensure an
adequate supply of critical parts and supplies is on hand, given the significant
delays that can occur in receiving parts. Our test of orders for 20 other critical
parts disclosed that it took the Command more than three months to receive
10 of the parts. The Command also needs to improve its inventory controls
and record keeping practices. Inventory items were not routinely counted and
reconciled with the records, access to the storeroom was not properly
restricted, and procedures were not in place to ensure that all withdrawals
were posted to the inventory records.
Our audit tests disclosed that the Command performs helicopter inspections
at the required intervals, but certain maintenance tasks were not performed
because inspection procedures were not updated in accordance with certain
manufacturer service bulletins.
Regarding Objective 3, we had difficulty in determining the adequacy of the
staffing (organizational) structure because there are few comparable law
enforcement organizations or other entities that operate a helicopter fleet and
that have a very similar mission profile. However, based on the information
available and our comparisons with entities whose responsibilities included
both medevac and law enforcement mission, we determined that the
Command’s organizational structure seems reasonable. Other entities we
contacted (including other local and state law enforcement agencies) made
mention of the Maryland State Police Aviation Command as a model for such
organizations. However, we identified several staffing issues impacting
operations, the most significant of which was turnover in key positions, such
as senior management, pilots, and mechanics/technicians.
Over a recent five-year period, the Command had 13 personnel changes
involving 5 senior management positions. The primary reasons for the
management turnover were transfers between positions within the Command
Office of 9
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 12 ---
and to other positions within the Department, as well as retirements. One
underlying factor contributing to this turnover—the frequency of which the
Department did not deem to be excessive or unusual—was the Department’s
practice to rely almost exclusively on troopers (with or without appropriate
prior aviation experience or technical expertise) to fill management positions
within the Command. Although this practice provides troopers with an
opportunity for advancement, it does limit civilian employee opportunities, an
issue brought to our attention by several Command employees. Also,
management turnover can affect the continuity and consistency of leadership.
In addition to management, turnover has been significant among pilots and
technicians, especially during fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Also, some
positions were understaffed (due, in part, to military deployments), which has
contributed to a rise in overtime costs from $538,000 (6.4 percent of total
salaries) in fiscal year 2004 to $1,171,000 (12.5 percent of total salaries) in
fiscal year 2007. The turnover experienced within the civilian pilot and
technician positions appears to have been primarily the result of the
Command’s low salaries when compared to industry survey data and other
entities. One key impact of high turnover, at numerous positions and levels,
has been a reduction in institutional knowledge, as many current employees
have limited experience with the Command. Turnover is also costly; we
estimated that it costs more than $100,000 to train a pilot to the Command’s
standards.
Regarding Objective 4, we found that Command had not formally defined the
term “Golden Hour” and that the underlying data supporting these reported
results were not consistent with the accepted definition of “Golden Hour.”
The University of Maryland Medical Center defines the “Golden Hour” as the
hour between injury and delivery of a patient to a trauma center. This
definition is consistent with the definition used by medical professionals.
Since the Command does not know the time of injury, it uses the time that the
section receives the medevac request from its central Systems
Communications center (SYSCOM) as the starting point of the “Golden Hour,”
which is always after the time of injury. Nevertheless, the Command should
define the term and ensure its method of measurement conforms to this
definition.
As a result of certain data issues, we were unable to conclude with respect to
the reliability of the reported Managing for Results (MFR) for the “Golden
Hour” for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, which showed that 94.81 percent and
94.36 percent of the missions were completed within the “Golden Hour” for
the respective years. Specifically, quality control procedures had not been
established by the Command to verify the accuracy of the mission times
10 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 13 ---
recorded in the database used to determine the percentage of missions
completed within the “Golden Hour.” Furthermore, the Command did not
retain documentation supporting its MFR calculations for fiscal years 2005
and 2006 nor did it retain voice transmission data, which would enable a
verification of the recorded times in the database.
Using the database, we were able to recompile the information used by the
Command to calculate the “Golden Hour” results for those two years.
Although the Department of State Police’s (DSP) reported results were
properly computed, we determined that the underlying data (such as the
recorded times for each mission) were unreliable based on certain
questionable flight times.

Background Information
Organization
The Department of State Police Aviation Command (Command) is a public
safety organization, with a primary mission of providing emergency medical
transport (medevac), that also provides search and rescue services, airborne
law enforcement services, and homeland security operations throughout the
State of Maryland. As depicted on page 14, the Command operates its 12
helicopters and 2 fixed-wing aircraft out of eight bases (referred to as
“Sections”) throughout the State. Maintenance operations are conducted at
Martin State Airport in Baltimore County. To carry out its missions, the
Command employs pilots, trooper/flight paramedics, and maintenance
technicians (referred to as “technicians”), in addition to management
personnel and related support staff.

Funding
The Command receives funding primarily through the Maryland Emergency
Medical System Operations Fund. This Fund, established under the
Transportation Article, Title 13 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, is funded
by a surcharge levied on owners of motor vehicles registered in the State. The
Command derives 80 percent of its operating budget from this Fund and the
remaining 20 percent of its budget from general funds. This allocation is
reportedly based on the previous years’ proportion of the Command’s
medevac missions as a percentage of all missions. For fiscal year 2007,
according to the State’s financial records, the Command’s expenditures were
$22.3 million, of which approximately 59 percent was salaries and related
benefits.1
1 As noted elsewhere in this report, the Command also operates two fixed-wing aircraft for
prisoner transport and homeland security; however, the Command’s financial records do not
permit an identification of those specific costs.
14 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 17 ---
Chapter 416, Laws of Maryland 2006, established the State Police Helicopter
Replacement Fund and provided that a portion of a $7.50 surcharge
assessed in certain types of traffic violations be credited to the Fund. After
reimbursement of implementation costs associated with the surcharge, funds
collected are to be shared evenly between the Replacement Fund and the
Volunteer Company Assistance Fund until such time that $20 million is
credited to the Assistance Fund; all subsequent surcharges collected will be
credited to the Replacement Fund. The Replacement Fund may be used for
purchasing new helicopters and auxiliary equipment, ground support
equipment, and any other capital equipment related to helicopters.
Section 6 of Chapter 6, Laws of Maryland 2007, Special Session, allocated
$110 million of sales and use tax revenue collected from January through
June 2008 to the Replacement Fund. It also specified that the budget bills for
fiscal years 2009 through 2012 include amounts to purchase three
helicopters each year and directed the Department to purchase a flight
simulator for training purposes.2
Chapter 414, Laws of Maryland 2008, modified the 2007 Replacement Fund
funding provision and reduced the allocation of sales and use tax revenue
from $110 million to $50 million. To replace this funding, the law also
provided that the Governor appropriate a total of at least $70 million to the
Fund in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 to purchase 12 helicopters on or
before June 30, 2012, and stated that these funds may come from any fund
that receives proceeds of sales and use tax. The $70 million could be
reduced depending on certain specified budgetary actions.
Helicopter Fleet
The Command operates 12 American Eurocopter Dauphin helicopters that
were purchased and placed in service between 1989 and 1999 (see Table 2
on page 16). Due to the extended period between the purchases, the
Command has three different versions or configurations of the Dauphin
helicopters. The Command advised that the different versions require the
pilots to perform different operating procedures in some instances. In
addition, some parts are not interchangeable between the different versions
and some maintenance requirements may vary.
2 The actual responsibility for including funding requests in future budgets rests with the
Governor.

(cid:88) The basic model is the AS365 Dauphin. N-1 is the original and older model, while N-3 is
the most up-to-date configuration. The primary difference between models is performance
improvements from more powerful engines. The Command has updated several N-1
models to the more powerful N-3 configuration. “Date Reconfigured” is the date the
helicopter was retrofitted to an N-3 configuration, including new engines.
(cid:89) The flight hour readings were taken on various days in October 2007 based on auditor
access to helicopters. The source is the “Hobbs meter” on each helicopter, which records
the number of hours of engine operation when the helicopter is airborne. When an engine
is replaced on a particular helicopter, we were advised that the specific Hobbs meter is
retained on that helicopter; therefore, the recorded flight hours actually represent total
flight time since the original purchase date of the helicopter, and not necessarily the flight
hours for the engines currently in use.

Mission Types
As noted previously, the Command’s primary missions are for medevac, law
enforcement, search and rescue, and homeland security. Table 3 (below)
defines each of the Command’s mission types.
Table 3
Command Helicopter Mission Types and Definitions
Mission Type Definition
Medevac Provision of emergency medical services care in
conjunction with the rapid helicopter transfer of an ill or
injured patient from a field site to a trauma center or to
another specialty center within an expedited time frame.
Patient Transfer Provision of patient inter-hospital transfer involving
transport for critically injured or ill patients from one
hospital to another for a higher level of care.
Damage Assessment Provision of aerial surveys from natural and manmade
disasters. For statistical purposes, these missions are
considered a type of law enforcement mission.
Law Enforcement Support for law enforcement activities, generally within
State boundaries. Includes searching for and tracking
suspected criminals, searching for stolen property (such
as vehicles), civil disturbance responses, tactical medical
support, and transfers of police personnel.
Search and Rescue Provision of aerial search and rescue services for lost or
disoriented children and adults, and for missing, lost, or
overdue property, aircraft, and watercraft.
Homeland Security Operations related to proactive and as-needed services,
including patrol checks of potential terrorist targets, and
transport of personnel for homeland security incidents.
Support Operations related to personnel training, maintenance,
demonstration, and executive transport.

Command’s helicopter missions
Mission Statistics
Using data recorded by the Command’s System Communications center
(SYSCOM) and contained in the automated RightCAD database (used to
record and maintain mission data), we compiled completed mission statistics
for fiscal years 2003 through 2007. The data shown in Tables 4 and 5 and
Charts 1 and 2 on the following pages reflect all mission types but do not
include missions performed by the Command’s two fixed-wing aircraft and
O ff i c e o f 17

cancelled missions (such as missions provided by other entities to assist the
Command). For example, other nonprofit entities, such as the U.S. Park
Police, provide medevac services in certain parts of the State when a
Command helicopter is not available.

Information Systems
All helicopters are dispatched from a central location, referred to as System
Communications (or SYSCOM), located on the University of Maryland,
Baltimore campus. SYSCOM is staffed around the clock by Command
personnel, under the supervision of a trooper duty officer. All helicopter
dispatch and mission information is entered into RightCAD, an automated
system implemented in 2001 to better document mission information.
RightCAD is updated by the duty officer at SYSCOM, who dispatches the
helicopters to various calls and communicates with the crews while on
missions. Requests for helicopter services are received from various sources
such as ground-based emergency medical teams (for example, volunteer fire
department units) and local law enforcement. As the duty officer is speaking
with the helicopter crew, the officer is entering the mission information into
RightCAD in real time. Consequently, RightCAD does not rely on paper
documentation to support the information recorded. Information documented
includes the section that responded (such as Trooper 1), the date and time of
the helicopter request, the dispatch date and time, the county where the
mission is located, the crew member names, the type of mission, the entity
that requested the helicopter, the drop-off location, and the total flight hours.
The duty officer also documents the following dates and times as they are
reported by the pilot while on the mission: (1) when the section responded or
departed from the aircraft hangar, (2) when the unit arrived at the scene, (3)
when the unit departed from the scene, (4) when the unit arrived at the
destination or trauma center, (5) when the unit departed the destination and
was back in service, (6) when the unit arrived back at the section.
In addition to RightCAD, we identified three other systems used by the
Command to help manage and monitor its operations: Section Downtime
Database, MxManager, and the Maryland State Police Data Management
System (MDSP DMS). Like RightCAD, these are all stand-alone systems. The
Section Downtime Database tracks the amount of time a section is
unavailable for missions because of helicopter maintenance, weather
conditions, or crew shortage. Similar to RightCAD, it is updated based on
SYSCOM communications. The MxManager system, which is a work order
system, is used by the Command to manage helicopter maintenance and
parts inventories. Finally, MDSP DMS is a Department-wide system that
provides the Command with daily flight status reports. Table 6 on the
following page provides additional details on these four critical information
systems.

Federal Aviation Administration Regulations
The Command currently operates under Part 91 of the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations for general flight operations. These
regulations specify certain operational requirements for certifications, flight
rules, maintenance, and records. Entities that conduct similar operations on
a fee-for-service basis must comply with Part 135 of these regulations for
commercial operations. Part 135 is considered more stringent as it adds a
number of additional requirements on those operators in areas such as
certification, number of crew required on missions, and recordkeeping. 3 In
Exhibit A on page 90, we compared some of the major provisions of Part 91
and Part 135. Although not required under Part 91, the Command has
voluntarily implemented a number of policies that mirror Part 135 and that
address flight and other operational requirements, including an operations
manual, flight hour requirements for new pilots, flight crew duty time
limitations, and flight crew duty rest requirements.
Safety Record
Although the Command’s aircraft operations have had a number of minor
incidents, as documented both in the media as well as in internal documents
such as Accident Safety Reviews, it has established a significant record of
safety in performing its missions. The last reportable helicopter accident with
injuries and damage to a helicopter occurred in September 1989. The last
helicopter accident with a fatality occurred in September 1986. Both of these
accidents predate the Command’s use of the American Eurocopter Dauphin
helicopter.
The Command’s accident rate is clearly better than the national average. In a
January 2006 Special Investigation Report on Emergency Medical Services
(EMS) Operations, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) noted
that, between January 2002 and January 2005, there were 55 EMS accidents
in the United States, of which 41 involved helicopters. The report also noted
that the national EMS helicopter accident rate per 100,000 flight hours
increased from 3.53 accidents between 1992 and 1996 to 4.56 accidents
between 1997 and 2001. However, during the period between September
1989 and October 2007, the Command’s current helicopter fleet has logged
almost 90,000 flight hours without an NTSB reportable accident, injury, or
3 Consequently, if consideration were ever given to having the Command charge fees for
patient transport or for missions conducted for other local law enforcement units, the
evaluation would need to consider the additional costs necessary to comply with the more
stringent requirements of Part 135 of the FAA regulations.

fatality. Over the past five years, the Command’s records indicate that it has
flown more than 40,100 missions, including more than 24,500 medevac
missions.

Audit Scope, Objectives,
and Methodology
Scope
We conducted a performance audit of certain aspects of the Department of
State Police’s Aviation Command (Command) helicopter operations and
maintenance functions. This audit was conducted in response to a request
from the Joint Audit Committee. We conducted the audit under the authority
of the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland and performed it in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe
that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Objectives
Our audit had four specific objectives, which were established under the
guidance of the Joint Audit Committee:
1. To determine the use and availability of the Command’s helicopter
fleet, which consists of 12 American Eurocopter Dauphins, based at
eight locations (referred to as sections) throughout Maryland
2. To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the Command’s
helicopter maintenance and inspection operations
3. To evaluate the adequacy of the Command’s staffing structure,
personnel practices, and training policies
4. To determine the reliability of the Command’s “Golden Hour”
Managing for Results (MFR) performance measure that identifies the
timeliness of patient transport to trauma centers
O ff i c e o f 27
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 30 ---
Given those objectives, which were established under the guidance of the
Joint Audit Committee, the following objectives were excluded from our scope:
• An assessment of any current or future helicopter replacement plans
• An analysis of the costs and benefits of replacing the current State
Police medevac fleet with a private patient transport helicopter service
or of transferring the function to an existing or new State agency
• An assessment of the adequacy or appropriateness of the Command’s
funding sources
• An evaluation of the guidelines or protocols for an emergency or
responder to request a Medevac helicopter to ensure that only critical
patients are transported
Methodology
To accomplish our objectives, we reviewed and tested various mission,
maintenance, and personnel records. We interviewed more than 110
Command personnel and performed extensive procedural reviews and tests of
a number of information systems deemed critical to our audit objectives. The
audit also included a review of appropriate Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) requirements and regulations regarding operations of rotary winged
aircraft (that is, helicopters). Working with the Command, we determined
whether there were similar operations4 in other Maryland jurisdictions, in
other states, and in the federal government (including the U.S. Coast Guard
and U.S. Navy) to use for comparison purposes; we contacted those
operations to obtain relevant data. To aid in the accumulation of those data,
we prepared a survey, and the related responses are included, as applicable,
throughout this report.
Our first objective was to determine the use and availability of the Command’s
helicopter fleet. To determine the extent to which the Command’s helicopter
fleet was available for critical missions, we conducted tests, based on non-
statistical sampling, of the mission classification data contained in the
Command’s RightCAD database by verifying the recorded data to voice
transmissions between the Command’s System Communications center
(SYSCOM) and the helicopter sections. Having determined it to be reliable for
purposes of classifying missions, we compiled the recorded data to determine
the impact non-critical missions had on the Command’s operations, and to
determine the extent of cancelled missions. To determine the impact
helicopter downtime had on the Command’s ability to perform missions, we
4 For comparison purposes, we identified entities operating rotary winged aircraft for law
enforcement or medical evacuation/transport, and/or entities flying American Eurocopter
Dauphin helicopters of a model comparable to the Command’s.

conducted tests, based on non-statistical sampling, of the data contained in
the Command’s Section Downtime database. Due to reliability issues of the
underlying data, and deficiencies in the level of detail recorded, we compiled
data from underlying sources, such as maintenance work orders, in an effort
to estimate the extent to which helicopters were not available during fiscal
year 2007 due to maintenance.
Our second objective was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the
Command’s helicopter maintenance and inspection operations. We assessed
the internal controls over and the effectiveness of the Command’s
MxManager database—a work order system used to manage maintenance
and inventory data—as well as the internal controls over the Command’s parts
and supplies inventories and its record keeping practices and conducted
related tests. We used available source documents, including maintenance
program manuals and Hobbs meter readings of flight hours, to assess the
adequacy of the Command’s parts inventory to minimize downtime resulting
from helicopter maintenance. We conducted tests of the timeliness of
helicopter inspections by referring to inspection reports, work orders, and
Hobbs meter readings. We reviewed independent sources on helicopter
maintenance operations, such as FAA guidelines, and attempted to identify
best practices of entities with a similar structure and/or mission profile.
Our third objective was to evaluate the adequacy of the Command’s staffing
structure, personnel practices, and training policies. We surveyed other law
enforcement governmental entities that operate helicopters and identified
four state police departments that performed both medevac and law
enforcement missions and compared their organizational structures with that
of the Command. We interviewed more than 110 Command personnel
(including most management personnel, pilots, trooper/flight paramedics, and
technicians) to identify potential concerns, and reviewed personnel practices.
We compared salaries to industry data by reviewing industry publications and
by contacting entities operating helicopter missions, both private and
governmental. We reviewed human resources files to quantify employee
turnover rates and vacancies and the related reasons. Finally, we reviewed
training programs and select employee training files.
Our final audit objective was to determine the reliability of the Command’s
“Golden Hour” Managing for Results (MFR) performance measure that
identifies the timeliness of patient transport to trauma centers. We assessed
the processes and quality control procedures over the Command’s “Golden
Hour” data compilations and calculations. We conducted analyses of the
O ff i c e o f 29

mission times, as recorded in the Command’s RightCAD database and
attempted to verify flight times using tape recordings of voice transmissions
between SYSCOM and the Command sections.
Fieldwork and Department of State Police Response
We conducted our fieldwork from June 2007 through February 2008. The
Department’s response to our findings and recommendations is included as
an appendix to this report.

Findings and
Recommendations
Objective 1
Availability and Operational Use of the
Command’s Helicopter Fleet
Conclusion
This audit objective was to determine the extent to which the Command’s
helicopter fleet was available for critical missions, as well as the extent to
which it was used for other purposes (such as for demonstrations), over the
five-year period ended June 30, 2007. Since helicopter downtime can have
significant impact on the Command’s ability to perform missions, we also
estimated the extent to which helicopters were not available during fiscal year
2007 due to conditions such as weather and maintenance.
Based on our review of the Command’s RightCAD database, which we
deemed to be reliable for purposes of classifying missions, we determined
that, on average, approximately 97 percent of the helicopter missions
occurring over this five-year period were critical missions, such as to provide
emergency medical transport and airborne law enforcement services. We
concluded that the use of the helicopters for non-critical missions was not
significant and, as such, did not appear to have a detrimental impact on the
Command’s operations.
A portion of the Command’s critical missions included services provided to
other states and the federal government; however, because of reciprocal
arrangements, it appears that, generally, a corresponding amount of services
was received by the State from those entities. The Command also assisted
local law enforcement agencies who did not have helicopters available or
whose helicopters lacked the necessary equipment to effectively respond to
particular incidents.

Although the Command tracks section downtime (that is, its duration and the
reasons why any one of the eight helicopter sections is not available for
missions during scheduled hours of operation), the Section Downtime
database suffers from reliability issues. Independent verifications were not
performed to verify downtime recorded in the database and, as a result, errors
were identified. For example, our tests of 61 downtime entries disclosed 32
instances of time entry errors. Also, the Command did not track downtime by
individual aircraft, only by operational section. Since individual helicopters
are rotated between sections, identifying specific helicopter downtime would
be useful in managing the fleet.
Because we could not rely on the Command’s Section Downtime database,
we compiled data from several available sources, such as maintenance work
orders, in an effort to estimate the impact of maintenance on helicopter
availability during fiscal year 2007. While section availability is impacted by
numerous factors, including weather and crew availability, individual
helicopter availability is only impacted by maintenance.
Although the Command has 12 helicopters, we estimated that, for 51 days
during fiscal year 2007, fewer than 8 of the Command’s helicopters were
available, meaning that at least one of the eight sections did not have an
available helicopter on those days. We could not determine the extent to
which the lack of available helicopters on any given day affected operations.
However, according to the Command, when only seven helicopters are
available (in 42 of the 51 days), it usually temporarily closes the section
located in Montgomery County which, if necessary, can generally be served by
other sections or by the United States Park Police aviation unit. Our analysis
also indicated that six of the helicopters were individually unavailable for more
than 120 days during fiscal year 2007. Some of the factors contributing to
the lack of available helicopters relate to the findings identified in Objective 2.
Finally, the Command should continue to pursue the acquisition of a flight
simulator to reduce helicopter flight time for pilot training purposes.

Findings
Mission Data
1. Helicopters were used primarily for the State’s critical
missions. Missions undertaken for other providers and non-
critical purposes did not appear to significantly impact the
helicopter usage and availability – Our evaluation of the use of
Command helicopters based on the RightCAD database, which we tested
and deemed to be reliable for purposes of classifying the missions,
disclosed that critical missions accounted for the vast majority of the
helicopter missions.5 Missions for other purposes (such as for
demonstrations) and non-critical missions were generally not significant
to the overall use of the fleet. Through reciprocal arrangements, the
Command receives mission services from other states and the federal
government that generally correspond to the amount of mission services
it provides to them.
On average, approximately 97 percent of the helicopter missions
occurring over a five-year period pertained to critical missions, such as to
provide emergency medical transport and airborne law enforcement
services.

5 Much of the information presented in the tables in this section is based on the Command’s
RightCAD database. We tested the database to underlying source information and found
the data to be generally reliable for the purposes of classifying missions. Although, in
objective 4, we comment that the Command did not have a quality assurance process to
ensure the reliability of mission times recorded in RightCAD, that deficiency had no impact
on the classification of missions.

The use of helicopters for demonstration missions,6 as shown in Table 8,
is the most common reason for noncritical missions. The Command has
implemented a policy requiring the review and approval of all
demonstration missions in writing that considers a number of factors,
including flight time and safety. The policy also states that
demonstrations should be held, to the extent possible, at a Command
section, rather than at a different location. Helicopters used for
demonstrations are still available for missions, if the need arises.

(cid:88) Non-Agency training entails providing a helicopter to assist a local fire rescue unit in
emergency response and medevac coordination.
The Command provides critical mission aid to certain other states and to
the federal government. In addition, these entities, as well as
commercial providers, provide assistance to the State. In this regard,
the Command maintains memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with
these entities and with commercial providers that provide services within
the State. The MOUs do not call for reimbursement for flight costs;
rather, they recognize the need for inter-jurisdictional cooperation and
6 It is important to note that that a demonstration mission differs from a ride-along (referred
to as the Operations Awareness Program or OAP), also provided by the Command. While a
demonstration mission involves the use of a helicopter away from its base and is used as a
public relations tool, an OAP flight involves taking appropriate personnel, who are involved in
policy decisions or who interact with the Command, on routine missions. In accordance with
Command policy, interested personnel must complete a request form. Accepted
participants receive a safety briefing from Command duty staff and complete a form
releasing the Command from any liability. Since participants then accompany the crew on
any missions that section performs, these missions are included under the appropriate
mission code (for example, medevac).

detail the scope of services to be provided. In addition, if a commercial
provider performs a medevac mission, it can bill the patient or the
patient’s insurer for the related costs.
Tables 9 and 10 show that the Command receives aid from other
providers (such as the U.S. Park Police) in amounts similar to the aid it
provides to other jurisdictions. We concluded that, given that the
amounts are similar, these missions do not have a significant impact on
Command operations.

(cid:88) Total missions include missions undertaken by commercial providers on behalf of

The Command also provides aid to Maryland jurisdictions (primarily local
law enforcement agencies for enforcement and search and rescue
assistance) as shown in Table 11 on page 36. The Command’s
helicopters essentially cover the entire State and, since 19 of the State’s
24 local jurisdictions lack aviation capability, the Command provides
assistance to those local law enforcement units. Given the Command’s
mission, the use of the State’s fleet to aid local entities appears
reasonable.

There are five local subdivisions in Maryland that operate police
helicopters; however, Command advised that these helicopters lack the
comprehensive equipment that the Command owns (such as power
hoists and medical equipment) and/or are not operated in weather
conditions or at times in which the Command will operate. For example,
most Command helicopter locations are staffed 24/7, while most local
police aviation operations are not. Anne Arundel County, for example,
generally operates its helicopters eight hours a day, from 6 p.m. to 2
a.m. Table 12 provides details of the subdivisions with aviation
operations.

2. Cancelled missions were primarily caused by situations
outside of the Command’s control – In addition to statistics on
critical and noncritical missions, the Command maintains statistics on
cancelled missions—those in which a Command section was contacted
but the mission was not undertaken or was not completed. Tables 13
and 14, which follow, show the number of and related hours for
cancelled missions, according to the Command’s RightCAD database.
Our review of the Command’s records of total missions and hours for
cancelled missions disclosed that, in the vast majority of cases, the

Section and Aircraft Downtime Statistics
Background
The Command maintains the Section Downtime database to track the amount
of time the various sections are down and not available for missions. Section
downtime occurs as a result of weather conditions, helicopter maintenance,
and/or crew unavailability. Weather conditions that cause downtime include
those below minimum safety levels set by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), such as reduced visibility, and other weather-related factors that the
Command considers would create unsafe flying conditions. Sections are
down for maintenance reasons when helicopters are undergoing scheduled or
unscheduled maintenance and no spare helicopter is available. Finally,
sections can be down when a crewmember (pilot or trooper/flight paramedic)
does not report for work unexpectedly and a replacement is not immediately
38 O f f ic e o f

Audits

--- Page 41 ---
available. Information on downtime is reported by the section and is recorded
by the Command’s System Communications center (SYSCOM) personnel in
the Section Downtime database. The time when a section returns to
availability is recorded based on phone calls indicating that the weather has
improved, replacement staff has arrived, or the helicopter has been released
from maintenance.
Based on the information in the Section Downtime database, we compiled
statistics for section downtime, in hours, as shown in the Table 15. Total
downtime for all sections by reason is shown in Table 16 on the following
page. For perspective, collectively, the eight sections should be operational
for 67,160 hours for the year. This reflects six sections that operate 24 hours
a day, and two sections that do not. As noted below, during fiscal year 2007,
the data shows that sections were down a total of 7,797 hours, representing
11.6 percent of the available operational hours. It is important to note that
individual section downtime may not significantly impact service delivery, as
there is often some overlap in normal operational areas covered by each
section. Additionally, as previously mentioned, DSP has a number of MOUs
with other helicopter service providers in the event one or the other is unable
to undertake a mission.

(cid:88) As noted in Finding 3 below, data in the Section Downtime were not always accurately
recorded.
(cid:89) The Section Downtime database erroneously shows a significant increase in crew-related
downtime for fiscal year 2007. This was caused by an error in accounting for staffing
hours at two sections. Specifically, Sections (Troopers) 5 and 7 are not staffed from 3 a.m.
and 7 a.m. daily. There were occurrences in which these non-scheduled hours were
mistakenly recorded in the Section Downtime Report; see Finding 3.
3. The Command should implement a process to verify the
reliability of the Section Downtime database, which we
determined contained inaccuracies – We randomly selected data
posted to the database for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and traced the
information to original source documents, such as maintenance work
orders, crew timesheets, and crew duty schedules, to determine if the
information was entered accurately in the database.7 Our test of 61
entries disclosed that 32 of these entries were inaccurate based on
source documents. Specifically, 21 incorrect entries resulted in
overstating the amount of time the section was down and 11 incorrect
entries resulted in understating the amount of downtime. In many
instances, the errors appeared to be caused by the incorrect entry of the
time a section returned to service. Some discrepancies ranged from
several minutes to more than an hour and, in one case, almost 10
hours.
We also noted that data were not always entered in a consistent manner
and there was no formal guidance on how to record the starting and
ending times (for downtime). For example, in certain instances the
database indicated that the downtime commenced when a helicopter
left its home base for maintenance. In other instances, the database
reflected that downtime began once the aircraft reached the

precise weather conditions for dates and Section locations selected.

maintenance hangar at Martin State Airport. In addition, the Command
had no process to independently verify the accuracy of the data in the
database. Consequently, obvious data errors were not detected. For
example, the Section Downtime database erroneously shows significant
increases in crew-related downtime for two sections in fiscal year 2007.
This occurred because SYSCOM occasionally recorded scheduled non-
operational hours as downtime. These two sections operate 20 hours
per day and generally do not fly between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. daily.
This condition impacts the accuracy of the statistics used to determine
the section downtime which could cause the operational status of the
Command to be misstated, and could ultimately impact decisions on the
number of helicopters needed to adequately service the needs of the
Command.
4. The Command should track downtime by individual
helicopter–While section downtime can be caused by several factors
(such as weather), downtime by individual aircraft results solely from
maintenance issues. However, because downtime caused by
maintenance issues was not tracked by individual helicopter, the
Command could not use its current information systems to monitor the
extent to which maintenance issues resulted in the availability of fewer
than the eight helicopters needed to staff all sections.
Due to the lack of available system records, in order to assess the extent
to which the Command’s helicopter fleet was available for missions, we
used various information maintained at the Command (such as work
orders, aircraft log books, and aircraft fleet status reports from the
Maryland State Police Data Management System), and made certain
assumptions to estimate the downtime by aircraft for fiscal year 2007.8
Our analysis indicated that six of the helicopters were individually
unavailable for more than 120 days during fiscal year 2007 as shown in
Chart 3 on page 42.9
8 Our determination of helicopter availability was based on a review of work orders, flight logs
and aircraft fleet status reports, and included certain assumptions. Specifically, when the
date of a work order was a day or more different than the date the inspector certified the
helicopter as ready to fly on the log for the related work order, we concluded that the aircraft
was not available from the date of the work order to the day prior to the inspector’s signoff
(in recognition of the fact that the helicopter would not likely be out of service for the entire
day on both the date of the work order and signoff).
9 Unlike Section downtime, helicopter unavailability relates solely to maintenance (scheduled
or unscheduled).

As noted above, we estimated that, for 51 of the 365 days in 2007,
fewer than 8 helicopters were available on those days, which would
require the temporary closure of 1 of the 8 sections, which is usually
Trooper 8 located at Norwood in Montgomery County. For 42 of those
51 days, 7 helicopters were available which—because of some service
area overlap and existing memorandums of understanding (MOU) with
various other governments (such as the U.S. Park Police) and
commercial helicopter providers—could have provided adequate
coverage. For those days in which fewer than 8 helicopters were
available, we could not determine the extent to which operations were
affected.

5. The Command should continue its efforts to procure a
helicopter flight simulator for pilot training purposes – State law
(Section 6 of Chapter 6, Laws of Maryland, 2007, Special Session)
directed the Department to purchase a flight simulator for training
purposes. In November 2007, the Command prepared a detailed
analysis of the costs and benefits and estimated that the use of a
simulator could save the Command more than $600,000 annually
because it would eliminate or reduce the need to use actual helicopters
for training. In December 2007, in conjunction with the Department of
General Services, the Department issued a solicitation for a simulator.
However, Command personnel advised that the bids received
significantly exceeded the allowable funding of $350,000 (the Command
received two bids: $619,500 and $1.8 million). As of February 18,
2008, no additional action had been taken regarding the purchase of a
simulator. Based on the RightCAD database, we estimated that
approximately 300 helicopter flight hours were logged for training
purposes during fiscal year 2007.
Recommendations

3. We recommend that the Command issue guidance to help ensure
consistent recording of section downtime and establish a process to

and determine the impact of maintenance on individual helicopter
availability.
5. We recommend that the Command continue its efforts to purchase a flight
simulator for training purposes.

Objective 2
Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Inspection
and Maintenance Policies and Practices
Conclusion
This audit objective was to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the
Command’s helicopter inspection and maintenance operations. According to
the Command’s records as of December 1, 2007, the maintenance staff
consisted of 22 technicians (including supervisors). Maintenance costs,
including payroll, totaled $7.8 million for fiscal year 2007.
Our audit disclosed that the Command lacked certain essential data to assess
the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its operations. The Command did not
compile or track data to determine the direct operating costs per flight hour,
including the actual maintenance labor hours spent for individual inspection
and repair tasks. These data are necessary to assess whether maintenance
tasks are efficiently performed, whether the current staffing level is sufficient,
and whether it is more cost-effective to use contractors for certain types of
repairs. Based on available data, it appears that certain inspections are
completed much more timely by outside contractors as opposed to in-house
maintenance staff. However, it is unclear whether this is due to staffing
issues, delays in receiving and under-stocking necessary parts, or some other
factor(s). Because of the lack of Command cost and labor-tracking data, the
cost-effectiveness of using contractors could not be assessed.
The Command did not adequately use automated system features to ensure
that parts were pre-ordered and stocked to minimize downtime resulting from
inspections and maintenance. Because certain maintenance is performed
based on hours of flight and entails replacement of critical parts, it is possible
to reasonably estimate the demand for certain parts. For example, we
estimated that, for 20 selected critical parts (such as rotor masts), the
Command was under-stocked for 7 of the critical parts based on estimated
flight hours of the fleet. It is imperative that the Command use available
information to ensure an adequate supply of critical parts and supplies is on
hand, given the significant delays that can occur in receiving parts. Our test of
orders for 20 other critical parts disclosed that it took the Command more
than three months to receive 10 of the parts.

--- Page 48 ---
The Command also needs to improve its inventory controls and record
keeping practices. Inventory items were not routinely counted and reconciled
with the records, access to the storeroom was not properly restricted, and
procedures were not in place to ensure that all withdrawals were posted to
the inventory records. We identified a number of differences between the
quantities of items actually on hand and the corresponding amounts in the
inventory records.
Finally, the audit tests disclosed that the Command performs inspections at
the required intervals, but certain maintenance tasks were not performed
because inspection procedures were not updated. Our test of all 76 FAA
directives and manufacturer service bulletins issued in fiscal years 2006 and
2007 disclosed 3 mandatory service bulletins that were not entered into the
maintenance system and, as a result, were not included in the scope of
maintenance work performed.
Background
The Command operates an FAA-approved repair station at Martin State
Airport, and conducts routine maintenance and repairs helicopter airframes
and certain components at that repair station. The Command is authorized to
perform maintenance in accordance with the manufacturer’s maintenance
program but may not perform overhauls of certain complex parts (such as
transmissions) nor perform any other maintenance not specifically authorized
by the FAA or manufacturer. In those cases, contractors’ services are used.10
To perform this maintenance and to inspect the completed work, the
Command employs 17 maintenance technicians, 2 avionics (aviation
electronics) technicians, 3 inspector supervisors, and certain other support
personnel. The maintenance unit operates during normal business hours
during the workweek and maintains a skeleton staff on weekends for
unscheduled maintenance (that is, items of an emergency nature). Routine
inspections and related maintenance are to be performed at intervals that are
based on flight time (such as every 25 hours), on calendar time (such as every
six months) or on both, as directed by the manufacturer for the specific
aircraft type. For example, routine inspections and maintenance are to be
performed at 25-hour intervals, with 50 and 100-hour inspections being more
detailed than those at 25 and 75 hours. (See Exhibit D on page 96 for an
10 As previously noted, the Command operates two airplanes. The Command’s maintenance
technicians are generally qualified to service both helicopters and airplanes. To the extent
practicable, we attempted to limit our review to helicopter servicing but, in a number of
cases, our findings might apply equally to the maintenance and servicing of airplanes.

example of a 25-hour inspection form.) Major service intervals occur every
600 hours (referred to as T inspections) and at 5,000 or 5,400 hours
depending on the version of the helicopter (G inspections). All maintenance
work must be inspected and approved by a Command certified inspector
supervisor before a helicopter can return to flight.
An independent consultant was hired by the State to analyze the missions of
both the Command’s and the Department of Natural Resources’ helicopter
fleets for the purpose of determining options for and timing of replacing the
current helicopter fleet. According to the consultant’s report, prepared in
March 2007, T and G inspection costs (including parts and service), per
helicopter, were estimated at $100,000 and $450,000, respectively. This
report also indicated that the Command faces significant costs for these
inspections in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 — estimating, for example, that five
aircraft will require G inspections at some point during this period. In addition
to the cost implications, this inspection schedule could impact the
Command’s ability to have 8 of its 12 helicopters available at all times for
missions, especially considering the need for other routine maintenance or
unscheduled maintenance. (A minimum of 8 helicopters must be operational
in order to have a helicopter on call at each of the eight helicopter sections
throughout Maryland.) The Command has acknowledged the validity of this
issue and advised us that it is currently working towards rotating aircraft in
order to limit the number of aircraft down for these inspections at any one
time.
The maintenance staff uses an automated system (based on a Microsoft
Access database) called MxManager to maintain information on helicopter
maintenance performed, parts inventories (including certain medical
supplies), upcoming maintenance, and life limits on parts and components.
The Command also maintains various paper documentation (such as work
orders, discrepancy sheets,11 and aircraft log books) that document work
performed, as required by the FAA. Inventories of aircraft parts and supplies,
as well as certain medical supplies, are maintained primarily in a central
storeroom at Martin State Airport, and each section also maintains a small
inventory of medical supplies and controlled drugs. The total value of the
inventory (excluding controlled drugs), based on MxManager, as of November
2007, was $4.8 million.
11 Discrepancy sheets are logs of maintenance problems or issues noted by pilots or
mechanics to be addressed during inspections.

Best Practices
We reviewed various sources to determine if accepted best practices for
helicopter maintenance operations existed. Based on our review, there does
not seem to be an accepted single set of standards for helicopter
maintenance operations or maintenance structure. However, there are a
number of sources that provide information on maintenance operations,
including the FAA (which sets, what are essentially, minimum requirements),
manufacturer guidelines and recommendations, and business organizations,
such as the National Business Aircraft Association.
We also attempted to identify best practices of entities that operate with a
structure and/or a mission profile (for example, medevac) similar to that of
the Command. However, we could not identify any other entities that were
operating with both a very similar structure and mission profile. We noted
significant differences impacting comparability, even among organizations
with a similar structure or mission profile, such as the number of mission
hours flown and the extent to which maintenance services were conducted in-
house or were contracted out. For example, the Command has a staff of 22
technicians (including supervisors) to conduct routine maintenance and
repairs for its 12 helicopters and 2 airplanes. Certain more extensive
maintenance and repairs are performed by vendors. In contrast, two federal
entities that operate with a mission profile and/or structure similar to that of
the Command, and that operate a similar type of helicopter, have more staff
than the Command to conduct routine maintenance and repairs for its
helicopters. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard Station (USCG) - Atlantic City,
which operates 10 of the same type of helicopter as the Command in a similar
mission profile with about twice the flight hours, conducts routine
maintenance using approximately 110 USCG personnel, but performs almost
all major repairs and inspections at another centralized location also staffed
by USCG personnel. We also noted two law enforcement entities in other
states that operate with a mission profile and/or structure similar to that of
the Command, but that operate a different type of helicopter. One has a
smaller staff and the other has a staff size similar to the Command’s, to
conduct routine maintenance and repairs. For example, one state unit, which
operates 13 helicopters, conducts routine maintenance and repairs for its
helicopters using approximately 20 technicians (including supervisors).
Contractors are used by the unit for more extensive maintenance, including
certain maintenance tasks that, in contrast, the Command performs in-house.

Findings
6. The Command performs inspections at required intervals – For
this objective, we conducted tests to determine if all inspections were
performed at the required intervals (essentially after every 25 hours of
flight). (See Exhibit D on page 96 for an example of a 25-hour inspection
form). For three judgmentally selected helicopters, we verified, by
reviewing work orders and related Hobbs meter readings taken at the
time the helicopters were grounded for maintenance, that the Command
performed all inspections, including any T and G inspections, at the
appropriate intervals during fiscal years 2006 and 2007.
7. The FAA has recognized Command maintenance technicians
and the Command for meeting certain training requirements –
Although training enhancements are possible, as discussed in objective
3, the Command and a number of its maintenance technicians have
been recognized by the FAA for meeting certain levels of training in
maintenance operations under the FAA's Aviation Maintenance
Technician Awards Program. This Program provides maintenance
technicians with incentives to improve safety by actively participating in
initial and recurring training and recognizes employers who take a
proactive role in training their technical workforce. Awards for
individuals are made based on the amount of training received in a
calendar year, and awards to employers are based on the percentage of
technical staff participating in the Program. In September 2007, the FAA
recognized seven Command employees for meeting the training
requirements of the Program. In addition, the Command received a Gold
Certificate of Excellence for meeting certain participation criteria.
Maintenance Costs
Background
Aviation units spend a significant portion of their resources maintaining
aircraft. Depending on the age of aircraft, maintenance costs can be the
single largest operating cost. Collecting and analyzing maintenance cost
information can help ensure that resources are available when needed, and
that costs are controlled without compromising safety.
O ff i c e o f 49
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 52 ---
8. The Command should develop comprehensive costs and
operational data – The Command did not separately track costs for
helicopter operations and for airplane operations, and did not track
actual labor hours spent on helicopter inspections and repairs.
Consequently, the Command could not determine, and we were unable
to develop, an accurate and comprehensive cost per helicopter flight
hour, and the efficiency of the maintenance operations and the
adequacy of the related staffing levels could not be assessed.
Although we were unable to estimate costs for helicopter operations,
using total annual direct maintenance expenses (all maintenance costs,
including maintenance salaries related to helicopters and fixed-wing
aircraft), as well as the flight hours per the Hobbs meter readings, we
determined an approximate cost of $1,250 to $1,300 per flight hour for
fiscal years 2005 to 2007 to maintain each helicopter and fixed-wing
aircraft.
The development of an accurate and comprehensive cost per flight hour
would be useful in determining and monitoring the cost-effectiveness of
operations, as well as for comparative purposes with similar entities.
The Command also did not record labor hours spent on specific
maintenance tasks, even though the automated system could record
and track this information. Without tracking the number of maintenance
hours used, it would be difficult to monitor potential problem areas and
training needs, as well as to evaluate personnel efficiency. The tracking
of maintenance hours could also be used to identify the optimal number
of personnel required for the Command’s maintenance operations.
Furthermore, since the Command did not know how much time was
spent on specific inspections, it was unable to make an accurate
assessment of the costs and benefits of using contractors to perform
various maintenance services (see Finding 9).
Assessing the adequacy of staffing levels was further complicated by an
apparent lack of industry standards. For example, without providing
appropriate benchmarks, the National Business Aviation Association’s
Management Guide states that a set of rules cannot be established for
the size or number of maintenance department personnel, although it
goes on to identify factors to be considered, such as type and number of
aircraft, and parts supply availability.

9. The Command should establish a process to identify when
outsourcing certain maintenance is in its best interest – The
Command periodically uses a contractor to assist in or to perform major
inspections, and to supplement its own maintenance staff. Although a
formal process had not been established to assess when a contractor
should be used (other than for certain services for which the Command’s
staff is not qualified to perform), the Command considers technician
workload and the need to have helicopters return to flight. We reviewed
Command and contractor inspection reports for eight recent T
inspections that were started during the period from February 2005
through June 2007— four inspections each by the Command and the
contractor. The T inspection is one of the more complicated and
comprehensive scheduled inspections and is required every 600 flight
hours. Our review disclosed that the helicopters were returned to duty
significantly faster when the T inspections were performed by the
contractor. The average inspection times for the eight inspections are
shown in Table 17 below.
Table 17
Time to Complete Four T Inspections
Command Contractor
Average Inspection Time (days) 135 42
Range (days) 66 - 226 37 - 45
Although the Command agrees that contractor inspections are generally
performed in less time than in-house inspections, the two in-house
inspections that took more than 160 days were caused by delays in
obtaining parts that were not on hand at the time of the inspection (that
is, parts not routinely requiring overhaul or replacement). Since each
Command helicopter averages about 400 flight hours per year, T
inspections can be frequent and delays in completing them can
significantly affect helicopter fleet availability. (Note that elsewhere in
this report we comment that the Command does not always have the
necessary parts available when a required inspection commences.)
Command management advised us that they are often not able to assign
the required number of personnel to these helicopter inspections
because of insufficient staffing (such as level of staffing). However,
since records were not available to determine what work was done by
each technician at any given time, we could not substantiate the
Command’s assertions regarding staffing. Management also advised
that assignment of maintenance staff for these T inspections could delay
other required maintenance work, causing further delays in returning the
O ff i c e o f 51
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 54 ---
helicopters to service. The contractor generally charges $80,000 for
each T inspection but, as noted in Finding 8, a lack of specific cost and
labor tracking data did not allow us to estimate the Command’s
comparable in-house costs.
10. The Command should track maintenance and repair costs
associated with aviation-related incidents – All aviation-related
incidents which impact safety are reported to and investigated by the
Command’s risk management unit, which consists of a safety pilot, a
trooper/flight paramedic, and a chief inspector. The results of the
investigations are documented on an Aviation Safety Report (ASR). All
ASRs are sent to Command management and are maintained for three
years. In addition, the Command compiles a quarterly Safety Report
(essentially, the preceding quarter’s ASRs) which is reviewed for trends
(that is, similar types of incidents) and distributed to all Command
personnel with the intent of keeping personnel informed, preventing
similar safety incidents from occurring in the future, and providing
additional training for individuals or groups of employees.
We reviewed the database used to retain ASR information in an attempt
to determine repair costs associated with addressing the reported
incidents. However, the Command does not specifically track repair
costs that result from an incident that generates an ASR and cannot link
a work order in MxManager to a specific ASR even though MxManager is
capable of tracking work orders generated from ASRs. Since an ASR
could be due to a maintenance problem, accumulating related cost data
for any repair would be helpful in determining the extent and the
financial impact of the safety incident.
Maintenance Information Systems
Background
Helicopters are subject to certain inspections of varying complexity based on
the number of flight hours. In addition, certain critical components and parts
have a useful life based on flight hours and are required to be replaced or
overhauled as a safety precaution once those predetermined hours are
reached. The Command maintains an automated system (MxManager) to
inventory its helicopter parts and to maintain work order information.
Accurate inventory records and timely availability of parts are critical to keep
the maximum number of helicopters available and to reduce downtime
resulting from maintenance.
52 O f f ic e o f

--- Page 55 ---
11. The Command should take the necessary action to ensure the
timely availability of parts – Although the Command has experienced
and acknowledged delays in obtaining helicopter parts for its fleet, and
has recently taken certain steps to address this, more should be done.
Specifically, the Command tracks flight hours of each helicopter to
anticipate required inspections, but it did not use available features of
MxManager to pre-order parts that would be needed for these
inspections. Availability of parts directly impacts the timeliness of
completing inspections (see Finding 9).
To gauge the impact of these conditions, we identified 20 critical parts
currently stocked by the Command (such as gearboxes and rotor masts)
and, using maintenance program manuals, maintenance log cards, and
Hobbs meter readings of flight hours, we estimated probable current and
future needs for the helicopter fleet. Our analysis indicated instances of
both too many and too few parts based on known or projected demand
for helicopters to be brought in for scheduled inspections and service.
For example, quantities on hand for 7 of the parts tested appeared to be
insufficient to meet estimated upcoming service needs as shown in
Table 18 below. We did note that other entities operating helicopter
fleets used a formal maintenance forecasting model to schedule
maintenance that focused on minimizing downtime and had a process to
ensure that known parts to be replaced were pre-ordered to be available
when the inspection comes due.
Table 18

Furthermore, the Command had not formally considered entering into
guaranteed maintenance programs with manufacturers (at a cost per
O ff i c e o f 53
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 56 ---
use), which would give it priority when ordering parts specified under the
contract, and would enable it to obtain parts faster and limit downtime.12
Our test of 20 other critical parts also disclosed that the Command has
experienced routine delivery delays in obtaining certain helicopter
components and parts that individually are necessary to place a
helicopter back into service. For 10 of the items tested, the Command
did not receive the parts until more than 90 days after ordering; in 7 of
these instances, the delays were more than 150 days. We were not able
to determine if these delays resulted in delays placing helicopters back
in service because the Command did not maintain data in the
automated records or in supporting documentation to track these
delays. A similar issue regarding delays in receiving parts was noted in
the aforementioned March 2007 consultant’s report on the Command.
In response to delivery delays, Command management advised us that
they had recently put into place a process to meet with one large
manufacturer’s representatives on a routine basis to discuss the
manufacturer’s records of unfilled purchase orders for parts. However,
the Command did not periodically compare its lists of unfilled purchase
orders to the manufacturer’s list of unfilled purchase orders. When we
compared those two lists, both dated October 10, 2007, we noted that
the manufacturer’s list did not include 38 of the 89 unfilled purchase
orders recorded by the Command. Twenty-four of these 38 purchase
orders were three months old or older as of the report date.
In addition to the delays experienced in obtaining helicopter parts, the
Command did not use inventory stock reports for reordering medical
supplies (non-controlled drugs). Finally, although MxManager included
minimum and maximum stock levels for medical supplies, the Command
had not reviewed usage to determine if these pre-determined levels
were appropriate to meet its operational demands.
12. The Command should ensure the accuracy of critical
information entered into its automated maintenance system –
Certain critical maintenance information and documentation of work
performed on helicopters was not always recorded in MxManager and a
process did not exist to ensure the completeness or appropriateness of
recorded data. Specifically, one employee entered relevant information
received from the FAA and the manufacturers (such as updated
12 Two helicopter operators indicated that such agreements reduce delivery time for critical
hard-to-obtain parts.
54 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 57 ---
inspection requirements), set system alert parameters for parts
expirations, and entered completed work orders into MxManager.
Without an independent review to ensure the accuracy of this posted
information, errors or omissions could occur and remain undetected.
Specifically, we noted the following conditions:
• Information entered into MxManager from FAA and manufacturer
sources was not complete. Our test of all 76 FAA directives and
manufacturer service bulletins issued in fiscal years 2006 and 2007
disclosed that 3 bulletins (dated December 2005, June 2006, and
August 2006) deemed mandatory13 by the manufacturer were not
entered into MxManager as of December 2007. Consequently, the
technician or pilot inspection checklists excluded these bulletins, and
the related parts were not inspected.
• System alert parameters which, based upon predetermined periods,
alert users that specified parts will need maintenance, such as an
overhaul or replacement, were not always entered or reasonable.
Our test of the alert parameters for 21 critical parts disclosed that 3
of these parts were not recorded in MxManager and, as a result, no
related alerts were in the system. In addition, the alert parameter for
1 other part was not set to allow sufficient time to order a
replacement part or to take other appropriate action. Specifically,
the alert parameter for a tail gearbox—that must be overhauled every
3,000 flight hours or 24 months—was set at 25 hours, leaving an
extremely short time for procurement.
• Our testing showed that not all completed work was entered into the
automated records. As a result, the Command would not be able to
effectively track all maintenance efforts for the fleet. Our test of 162
work orders completed during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 disclosed
that 7 work orders were not entered into MxManager; 4 of the 7 work
orders related to routine, required inspections, such as work
performed to complete a standard 50-hour inspection.
13. The Command should ensure that MxManager software is
current and access to the automated records is properly
restricted –The Command did not ensure that the most recent version
of the MxManager software had been downloaded from the vendor and
13 Two of the bulletins were one-time safety inspections related to the hoists and the third was
a daily inspection of the tail gearbox oil levels and tail rotor hub pitch for cracks.

installed on all applicable computers. For example, we noted that the
most current release was issued by the vendor on June 8, 2007 to
correct certain reporting deficiencies, including alert reports that did not
display the proper number of hours or months before a part was due for
overhaul, inspection, or retirement. However, the Command did not
update its computers for this version until September 27, 2007.
Furthermore, our review of three other updates issued in fiscal years
2005 and 2006 disclosed that two of the updates were installed on
Command computers 53 and 212 days after release. These updates
included modifications affecting areas such as maintenance alert
reports, aircraft status indicators, purchase order reporting, and changes
to inventory tracking.
In addition, 26 maintenance employees had access to the inventory and
work order modules that did not need complete access to all menu
options in these modules to perform their routine job duties. This access
would permit them to delete or make other adjustments to inventory. It
would appear there is little the Command can do to immediately limit
access since we were advised by a vendor representative that the
software was not designed to restrict access below the module level
(such as to specific menu options within a module); however, the
representative indicated that a modification might be possible.
Adequacy of Physical Controls Over Parts and Supplies Inventories
Background
The Command maintains a stock of parts and supplies (such as medical
supplies) necessary to keep the helicopters in flight and able to perform
missions. The majority of parts and supplies inventories are maintained at
the Command’s headquarters location at Martin State Airport. As of
November 2007, the value of inventory on hand (excluding controlled drugs)
totaled $4.8 million.
14. Parts and supplies (including controlled drugs) should be
routinely inventoried – The Command needs to improve processes
used to account for parts and supplies.
• We were unable to determine when the Command completed a
physical inventory of helicopter parts and supplies as well as certain
medical supplies (non-controlled drugs) maintained in the central
supply room. Although we were advised that cycle counting is used,
there was no documentation of the items counted and resulting
56 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 59 ---
actions taken, if any (such as adjustments to the records, approval of
differences), as required by the Department of General Services’
Inventory Control Manual.
• Inventories of controlled drugs maintained at headquarters were
taken sporadically. Our review of inventory records for calendar year
2007 (through November 15) for the seven controlled drugs stocked
by the Command disclosed that the Command could only document
that inventory counts had been taken between two and five times for
each drug. An October 2006 draft update to the Command’s
operating manual specified that the inventories of all controlled
drugs should be completed monthly. However, we were advised that,
while this update had been transmitted to all sections of the
Command, it had not been formally adopted.
• Inventory records for parts and supplies often did not accurately
reflect amounts on hand. Our counts of 40 items disclosed
variances from the inventory records for 14 items (such as rotor
blades), and 2 items that were not recorded in the inventory records
at all. In addition, our test of inventory purchases found that items
were frequently inaccurately recorded in the inventory records.
Although quantities received were generally accurate, we noted 9
instances, out of 20 purchases tested (valued at $1.81 million), in
which the $454,000 in costs were not accurately recorded in the
inventory records. In order to properly account for helicopter
maintenance costs, the costs of parts and supplies must be
accurately recorded.
15. Access to the central parts and supplies storeroom should be
properly restricted and controlled – Access to the main parts and
supplies (other than controlled drugs) storeroom at Martin State Airport
was not adequately restricted. The Command did not maintain a record
of who had been issued keys to one of two doors to the supply room,
which is kept locked at all times, and was unaware of the total number
of keys issued. In addition, while the other door to the supply room was
open during the normal working day when the custodian was on duty
and locked at all other times, the combination to this door’s lock was
known by a majority of Command staff. Furthermore, we noted that
three employees had keys to the medical supplies maintained in a
locked area within the general supply room (not including controlled
drugs, which are secured elsewhere) that did not need access as part of
their job duties.
O ff i c e o f 57
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 60 ---
16. Controls over inventory withdrawals should be enhanced –
Command policy requires that any withdrawal of helicopter parts and
supplies from inventory be recorded in MxManager and be associated
with an existing helicopter maintenance work order. Normally, it is the
inventory clerk’s responsibility to record this information into MxManager
as withdrawals are made during the day. However, because of the need
to perform weekend maintenance work when the inventory clerk is not
on duty, we were advised that maintenance technicians were given
access to the inventory storeroom and that the related withdrawals were
not always recorded in MxManager. In Finding 14, we noted differences
between MxManager and actual on-hand quantities. Furthermore, our
test of 61 work orders recorded in MxManager and our review of other
documents, disclosed that 4 parts (such as an antenna and an
emergency landing switch) used for 3 work orders had not been
recorded in MxManager.
Manuals and Policies
Background
The Command maintains an FAA-approved Repair Station Manual. This
Manual documents how the repair station functions and its structure, and
includes maintenance and quality control procedures. Various manufacturer
manuals also exist, including the American Eurocopter avionics manuals for
its helicopter fleet (describing the electric systems of the helicopters).
Separate manuals also exist for each version of the Dauphin helicopter.
17. A process should be established to ensure that operational
and maintenance manuals are kept current –The Command’s
FAA-approved Repair Station Manual and the American Eurocopter
avionics manuals were not always adhered to and kept current. For
example, we noted the following conditions:
• Our review disclosed a number of instances where current practices
differed from that contained in the approved Repair Station Manual.
For example, the Command’s current organizational structure and
documented job responsibilities of the maintenance unit did not
meet that of the Manual or that required by FAA regulations. We
noted that the Command’s current structure includes a number of
necessary positions not included in its approved Manual. The
Manual should also include the job duties and responsibilities
assigned to these positions. In addition, a number of current
operational practices were not incorporated in the Repair Station
58 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 61 ---
Manual, as required, such as the training program and the use of
contract maintenance for certain inspections.
• Our review of 10 helicopter avionics manuals disclosed that 4 had
not been updated for manufacturer revisions for periods ranging
from 5 to 14 years. In addition, the Command had never received
final wiring schematics for its 12 helicopters; rather, it operated
using schematics marked as “preliminary.” We were advised by
Command management that subsequent to our review of this area,
they received the appropriate wiring diagrams for the helicopters.
18. A continuous repair station self-improvement process should
be established as recommended by the FAA – Although not
required, the FAA guidelines recommend that a repair station establish a
continual and structured internal evaluation process for identifying areas
of noncompliance with FAA regulations and areas in need of
improvement. Command staff advised that, although such a process is
desirable, staffing limitations did not provide sufficient personnel
resources to initiate such a process, although certain limited informal
internal reviews had been conducted in the past. According to FAA
guidelines, a formal internal evaluation process should be independent,
have well-defined responsibilities, receive attention from upper
management, evaluate high-risk areas, include defined schedules of
activities, establish corrective action procedures, and document work
performed and related results. The overall internal evaluation program
procedures should be documented and followed. FAA examples of areas
that should be considered for an internal evaluation program include
• facilities and equipment;
• personnel qualifications, training, and staffing levels;
• supplier selection, approval, and surveillance;
• inspection and quality control processes;
• tool adequacy and calibration;
• process for returning an aircraft to service after maintenance;
• defect reporting; and
• records and recordkeeping procedures.
Many of these areas are commented on in this report as being in need of
improvement and could benefit from the continual oversight envisioned
with an internal evaluation process.

Other Findings
19. Accountability and controls over tools need to be improved –
Certain tools used to maintain the helicopters must be calibrated within
standards acceptable to the FAA. These tools are calibrated every 12
months in accordance with Command policy. This calibration ensures
the tools meet exacting standards critical to maintenance and safe
operation of the helicopters. The Command uses outside vendors to
calibrate tools; these vendors provide a certificate to document the work
done and place a tag on the tool to indicate the date, the vendor, the
tool number, and the next calibration due date. The Command
maintains tool calibration information in MxManager. Our test of tool
calibrations revealed that the last calibration date was not always
properly recorded in the automated records. For example, for 2 of the
20 tools tested, the Command could not locate the calibration
certificate, and for 1 of these tools the last calibration date was not
recorded in MxManager. The same employee both monitors and
updates all records for tool calibration and tool disposals, and there was
no periodic independent review, which might have detected these
omissions.
While the Command has a policy for accountability of tools, it was not
sufficiently comprehensive. The policy requires that toolboxes be
appropriately organized so that missing tools can easily be identified
after maintenance is performed; however, no employee, other than the
employee servicing a helicopter, was responsible for ensuring that all
tools were accounted for. We were advised that, during calendar year
2007, the Command identified three instances in which tools were left in
helicopters after maintenance was performed; these situations were not
discovered until later inspections (usually by the pilot prior to starting a
shift). On December 26, 2007, a Command employee reviewed 10
toolboxes for organization in compliance with its policy and found that 9
of the tested toolboxes were not organized in a manner to allow an
employee to easily identify missing tools.

Maintenance Costs
8. We recommend that the Command develop a system for tracking detailed
cost data for helicopter operations, including a process to track labor
hours for specific maintenance and inspection tasks. We also recommend
that the Command use these data, as well as any other reputable sources,
to create performance benchmarks and to monitor unit and employee
performance. We further recommend that the Command use these data
to perform an analysis of the adequacy of the size and composition of the
maintenance staff.
9. We recommend that the Command evaluate the costs and benefits of
using contractors for inspections rather than in-house maintenance staff.
10. We recommend that the Command track maintenance and repair costs
associated with safety incidents.
Maintenance Information Systems
11. We recommend that the Command implement procedures to help ensure
the timeliness of parts delivery. Specifically, MxManager should be used
to determine the appropriate stock levels for critical parts and supplies, to
order critical parts and supplies using the appropriate stock levels, and to
track the timeliness of parts deliveries. In addition, the Command should
continue its periodic contact with parts manufacturers in conjunction with
a process to account for all open orders, and should consider establishing
a guaranteed maintenance program with manufacturers to obtain parts in
a timely manner.
12. We recommend that the Command establish a process to ensure, at least
on a test basis, the completeness, accuracy, and reasonableness of all
critical information entered into MxManager and inspection checklists.
13. We recommend that the Command install system updates in a timely
manner and restrict system access to those employees who need such

access to perform their assigned job duties, including revising system
security, if warranted.
Adequacy of Physical Controls over Parts and Supplies Inventories
14. We recommend that the Command maintain accurate inventory records
and conduct physical inventories on a periodic basis in accordance with
the requirements of the DGS Inventory Control Manual. All physical
inventory counts should be documented.
15. We recommend that the Command restrict access to the central
storeroom to those employees who require such access and maintain a
record of those with access.
16. We recommend that the Command comply with existing policy and ensure
that all inventory withdrawals are properly documented and recorded in
MxManager.
Manuals and Policies
17. We recommend that the Command establish a process to maintain its

internal evaluation program for repair station operations to identify areas
of noncompliance with FAA guidelines, and to identify areas in need of
improvement.
Other Findings
19. We recommend that the Command ensure, at least on a test basis, that all

Objective 3
Personnel, Staffing, and Training
Conclusion
Our audit objective was to determine the adequacy of the Command’s staffing
structure and personnel practices and its training policies. As part of our
audit, we met with more than 110 of the Command’s employees to identify
areas of potential concern or other issues of relevance to the Command’s
operations. Determining the adequacy of the Command’s staffing
(organizational) structure proved challenging because our research found few
truly comparable law enforcement organizations or other entities that
operated a helicopter fleet and that had a very similar mission profile.
However, based on the information available and our comparisons with
entities whose responsibilities included both medevac and law enforcement
mission, we determined that the Command’s organizational structure seems
reasonable. Although other local and state law enforcement agencies entities
we contacted made mention of the Maryland State Police Aviation Command
as a model for such organizations, we identified several staffing issues
impacting operations. The most significant personnel issue confronting the
Command is turnover in key positions and addressing the apparent causes for
this turnover.
Our review disclosed that, over a recent five-year period, the Command had
13 personnel changes involving 5 senior management positions. The primary
causes for the management turnover were transfers between positions within
the Command and to other positions within the Department, as well as
retirements. One underlying factor contributing to this turnover—the
frequency of which the Department did not deem to be excessive or unusual—
was the Department’s practice to rely almost exclusively on troopers (with or
without appropriate prior aviation experience or technical expertise) to fill
management positions within the Command. Although we found this practice
provides troopers with an opportunity for advancement, it does limit civilian
employee opportunities, an issue brought to our attention by several
Command employees. Perhaps most significant is that this turnover can
affect the continuity and consistency of leadership.
In addition to management, turnover was found to have been significant
among pilots and technicians, especially during fiscal years 2006 and 2007.
Also, we found some positions were understaffed (due, in part, to military
O ff i c e o f 63
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 66 ---
deployments), which has contributed to a rise in overtime costs from
$538,000 (6.4 percent of total salaries) in fiscal year 2004 to $1,171,000
(12.5 percent of total salaries) in fiscal year 2007. Nevertheless, the turnover
experienced within the civilian pilot and technician positions appears to have
been primarily the result of the Command’s generally low salaries, compared
to industry survey data and other entities. One key impact of high turnover, at
numerous positions and levels, has been a reduction in institutional
knowledge, as many current employees have limited experience with the
Command. For example, 8 of the 21 maintenance technicians employed by
the Command as of June 30, 2007 had one year or less of service with the
Command. Another real impact is financial, as we estimated that it costs the
Command more than $100,000 to train a pilot to its standards. Although,
during the latter stages of our audit fieldwork and subsequent to that, the
Command has initiated some actions to address turnover issues, more needs
to be done. Finally, we determined that the Command’s training program
appears reasonable and that trooper/flight paramedics and pilots generally
received required training, although certain enhancements should be
undertaken by the Command.
Background
According to the Command’s records, as of December 1, 2007, the Command
employed 143 individuals, which comprised 79 civilians and 64 sworn police
officers (troopers). These employees included 36 helicopter pilots assigned to
sections, 4 helicopter pilots in initial training or on restricted duty, 37
trooper/flight paramedics assigned to sections, 22 aircraft maintenance
technicians, and 44 others including management, supervisors, and support
personnel. The Command also had 18 vacant positions, including 6
helicopter pilots and 6 trooper/flight paramedics. Fiscal year 2007 salaries
and wages, excluding fringe benefits, totaled approximately $9.4 million; see
Chart 5 on the following page. Pilots and trooper/flight paramedics are
typically assigned to one of the eight helicopter sections located throughout
Maryland. Technicians and support employees are assigned to Command
headquarters, located at Martin State Airport in Middle River. Command
policy is that all trooper/flight paramedics are sworn State Police officers,
while helicopter pilots include both civilians and sworn officers, of which
approximately 90 percent are civilians. All technicians are civilians.

Note: Elsewhere in this report, we comment that overtime has increased about $600,000
from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2007, which accounts for the majority of the salary and
wages increase in this Chart.
Salary Schedules
Since the Command employs both troopers (of various ranks) and civilians,
two separate salary scales are in use. The civilian employees fall under the
Department of Budget and Management’s (DBM) salary schedule for regular
State employees, while the troopers are under the Department of State Police
(DSP) salary plan. Additionally, retirement benefits differ: Troopers are
eligible for full retirement after 22 years of creditable service, and civilians,
which receive regular State employee benefits, are eligible for full retirement
benefits after 30 years of service. As commented upon later in this objective,
the Department’s salary plan does provide greater salary potential for the
troopers than for the civilian employees.
Employee Interviews
During the course of our audit fieldwork, we interviewed more than 110
Command employees (including administration personnel, pilots,
trooper/flight paramedics, and technicians) to identify their issues and
concerns about the operation of the Command. Through this process,
numerous concerns affecting maintenance, flight operations, and human
O ff i c e o f 65
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 68 ---
resources were identified. Below are the most common issues raised by the
Command’s employees:
• Inadequate vendor support for parts and delays in receiving ordered
parts
• Discord between civilian and sworn personnel resulting from
differences in pay, benefits, and promotional opportunities
• Low pay for all types of staff
• Shortage of technicians to maintain the helicopters
• High rate of management turnover
• Lack of training or irrelevant training (due to funding issues and/or the
unavailability of helicopters for training missions)
• Lack of aviation experience among Command management staff
• Inadequate funding for spare parts, equipment, and supplies
• Helicopter downtime, impacting the number of helicopters available for
missions
A number of these concerns appear to be legitimate issues with actual or
perceived (by Command personnel) impact on the Command’s operations.
We comment upon most of the above issues as findings in this objective and
elsewhere in this report.
Findings
20. While it was difficult to assess the adequacy of the
Command’s staffing (organizational) structure due to the lack
of truly comparable entities, based on the information
available, the Command’s structure appears reasonable - To
assess the adequacy of the Command’s organizational structure, we
surveyed other law enforcement entities that operate helicopters. We
identified four state police departments whose missions included both
medevac and law-enforcement. We identified differences in the
organizational structures of these units, which were the result of
differences in the methods used to address certain functions that would
be expected to be performed in connection with an airborne law
enforcement entity. Specifically, some common functions were
performed by using internal aviation command staff, by relying on
centralized staff at the oversight organization level, or by using
contractors. When these four entities used internal aviation command
staff for major functions, the applicable personnel were organized in
divisions similar to the Command. Considering this and other
66 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 69 ---
observations we made, the Command’s organizational structure seemed
reasonable.
As an example of the differences in how other states handle common
functions, we noted that none of the other four state aviation units
employed trooper/flight paramedics or other medical employees.
Rather, the on-board medical services were performed by others, such
as vendors that contracted with the states, or volunteer medical
personnel. In addition, the other state aviation units typically received
more support services (such as personnel and information technology)
from their respective oversight organizations.
The most comparable state aviation unit that we identified has 13
helicopters that operate from five bases, has a mission profile similar to
the Command and generally performs its own maintenance (although
contractors are used in a manner somewhat similar to the Command).
The unit’s aircraft maintenance department is organized similarly to the
Command’s maintenance department in that there are a limited number
of supervisory personnel for the maintenance technicians. In addition,
similar to the Command’s operation, this unit has a commander at each
base and the base commanders also fly on missions.
On the other hand, this unit does not employ trooper/flight paramedics
or other medical personnel and, rather than have its own administrative
personnel, it receives these support services from its state police
headquarters. For these reasons, this unit has only 67 employees
compared to the Command’s 161 employees (including vacancies). This
unit has four senior management employees (Director, Chief Pilot,
Assistant Chief Pilot, and Director of Aircraft Maintenance) overseeing its
operations, which is comparable to the Command’s five senior
management employees. The extra Command senior management
position recognizes that, unlike this other unit, the Command uses its
own personnel to perform recruiting and training, as well as to supervise
and evaluate 43 trooper/flight paramedic positions.
Given the functions performed by the Command, its organizational
structure seemed reasonable. The Command has five employees in
senior management: a commander, a deputy commander, and three
division directors. Each division has as an independent function—
operations, support, and maintenance. In addition, the Command has
eight helicopter section supervisors and four regional supervisors, as
well as numerous other support and administrative employees. All of the
section and regional supervisors regularly perform missions as pilots or
O ff i c e o f 67

--- Page 70 ---
trooper/flight paramedics, and some other administrative employees
(such as the personnel director, the director of procurement and
logistics) may also perform these duties, as needed.
21. Action should be taken to address the frequency of
management turnover within the Command – Our review of
personnel actions over the past several years disclosed an apparent lack
of continuity in certain of the Command’s management positions.
Specifically, we identified five positions that we believed were critical to
the overall management of the Command or to specific key segments of
the Command’s operation. From a review of human resource files, we
quantified the turnover experienced by these positions for a recent five-
year period and identified the reasons for the turnover. (See Table 19.)

Note: A simplified organizational chart is included as Exhibit E.
(cid:88) At the time of fieldwork, all of these positions were filled by troopers.
Despite the uniqueness of the Command’s operations, Department and
Command management did not consider this turnover to be excessive
and considered it to be typical for a police organization. Given the
Superintendent’s authority to assign personnel to positions and duties
as he sees fit to achieve the goals, mission, and objectives of the
68 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 71 ---
Department, it is an accepted practice within the Department to
frequently transfer employees between units, matching employee
capabilities with Departmental needs. As Table 19 indicates, such
transfers, both within and outside the Command, were the most
common reasons for position turnover, followed by retirements.
The transfers appear to be related, either directly or indirectly, to the
near-exclusive use of troopers to fill key Command management
positions. For example, during the course of our audit fieldwork,
paramedic sergeants filled the Command’s director of maintenance
position (which is included in Table 19) and personnel director position
(which falls under the Director of Support Operations and is not included
in Table 19). This use of troopers is understandable, given the nature
and culture of the Department, and it does provide the Department the
opportunity to internally promote staff who have demonstrated
supervisory abilities; however, it might come at the expense of expertise
in the unique areas or challenges related to operating an aviation
organization. In fact, the qualifications for employees to successfully
perform these jobs, such as the professional and/or technical expertise,
including aviation experience, had not been formally established. For
example, although the current Assistant Commander has relevant
technical experience having served as a trooper/flight paramedic, DSP
does not require senior Command management personnel to have prior
aviation experience, as management skills are deemed to be more
critical. Similarly, prior maintenance experience is not a requirement for
the Director of Maintenance position. Although management personnel
can be expected to obtain necessary, specialized knowledge while
working at the Command, frequent reassignments or transfers could
have an impact on overall Command operations.
Another identifiable cause of the management turnover was retirements.
We believe that this is also associated with the almost exclusive use of
troopers. Specifically, by the time troopers demonstrate or otherwise
obtain appropriate management skills, they often might be close to
retirement, as only 22 years of creditable service are required to be
eligible for full retirement.
We cannot quantify or otherwise conclude as to the impact of the
observed turnover. However, considering the uniqueness of the
Command to the Department of State Police, the resultant specialized
knowledge needed by Command management, and the feedback
received from employees, we maintain that minimizing management
turnover is desirable to establish leadership continuity and consistency.

There are issues confronting the Command, as highlighted in this report
(such as the need to improve information management systems, to
maximize helicopter availability by reducing downtime, to ensure an
adequate supply of helicopter parts, and to ensure the timely completion
of helicopter maintenance on an aging fleet), that require a sustained
and consistent leadership commitment to institute needed changes.
22. The Command should take action to address significant non-
management staff turnover and vacancies – The Command has
experienced non-management staffing issues, due primarily to turnover
and vacancies in key operational positions. Our analysis of staffing
trends for fiscal years 2003 to 2007 indicates that turnover of key non-
management positions (pilots, trooper/flight paramedics, and
technicians) has become more prevalent (see Table 20), especially
among pilots and technicians.

Source: DSP personnel records
Note: OLA calculated turnover rates by dividing the average total positions by the number
of separations from the Command during the year. Most of the turnover was not caused
by retirements.
In addition to turnover, Command staffing has been impacted in recent
years by vacancies and military leave. For example, as of December 1,
2007, the Command had budgeted 89 pilots and trooper/flight
paramedic positions for its eight helicopter sections. (Note that
technicians are not assigned to sections.) We independently estimated
that at least 85 pilots and trooper/flight paramedics were required to
fully staff the eight helicopter sections.14 During fiscal year 2007, when
compared to our estimate of 85 positions, those sections were still, on
average, understaffed by the equivalent of nine positions. To address
14 This is a minimum estimated number, based on the assumption that certain off duty staff
assigned at one location could fill in at another nearby location. The Command’s
preference is that trooper/flight paramedics and pilots be assigned full-time to a single
section since travel time to multiple sections could be onerous.
70 O f f ic e o f

Audits

--- Page 73 ---
this situation and to maintain required coverage, the Command has
increasingly relied on paying overtime to pilots and trooper/flight
paramedics. Between fiscal years 2004 and 2007, the Command’s
annual overtime expenditures, for all employees, roughly doubled, from
$538,000 (6.4 percent of total salaries) to $1,171,000 (12.5 percent of
total salaries), and consistently exceeded budgeted amounts for
overtime. Given the persistent vacancies and the requirement to
maintain a certain level of service, the increase in overtime costs is not
unexpected, although the current annual expenditures and upward trend
are clearly causes for concern.
Another impact of the high turnover of personnel is the resultant large
proportion of employees, especially technicians, with minimal experience
with the Command. (See Table 21.) For example, as of June 30, 2007,
11 of the 21 technicians had fewer than 5 years of service with the
Command, including 8 employees with less than one year of service.

(cid:88) Trooper/flight paramedics, as troopers, can retire after 22 years of
creditable service or at age 50. In addition, when trooper/flight
paramedics are promoted they may be transferred to other positions
outside of the Command. Primarily for these reasons, there are no
trooper/flight paramedics with more than 20 years of experience.
(cid:89) “Total Filled Positions” does not equal the number of budgeted positions,
which were 46 pilots, 43 trooper/flight paramedics, and 25 technicians as

Based upon documented employee exit interviews (conducted by the
Command for pilots), comments from pilot applicants (reviewed by OLA),
OLA discussions with Command management, and our interviews with
numerous Command personnel, the primary cause for pilot turnover was
the Command’s low salaries for civilian positions. From our discussions
with pilots, we also found a general dissatisfaction with a lack of
advancement by civilian employees into Command management
positions.
Given the assertion of low salaries, we attempted to identify the salaries
paid by other entities for similar employees. Although we experienced
difficulty in identifying comparable entities, and then in obtaining salary
information, ultimately, we obtained salary data from several sources
and compared it to the Command’s fiscal year 2008 salary schedule.
This comparison disclosed that the salaries of the Command’s
employees are generally below industry survey averages and below
those paid by other entities, especially with regard to civilian positions.

responses received. For example, other police units might conduct law

From this limited salary survey, which did not consider fringe benefits,
the Command’s helicopter pilot salaries appear to be substantially below
industry survey data and those paid by other entities, even though the
Command’s missions are frequently more challenging than missions
flown by most helicopter organizations. For example, the Command’s
pilots are frequently called upon at night to land in unfamiliar areas on
highways, parking lots, and fields. These landing zones may contain
dangerous obstacles such as unlit towers and wires. Conversely, pilots
in entities that only perform law enforcement missions generally take off
and land at the same airport.
The Command conducts exit interviews of all employees prior to
termination from service; however, only statistics for the reasons for
leaving the Command given by pilots are documented. Based on
Command records, low pay was indicated for 11 of the 21 pilots that
separated from service during the period July 1, 2002 through June 30,
2007. As previously noted, low salaries was frequently mentioned
during our interviews with numerous employees as an issue facing the
Command. In addition to employee retention, low salaries impact
recruitment efforts. According to the records maintained by the
Command’s personnel office, during the period from April 2004 through
October 2007 it received 100 applications for civilian pilots, including
several persons that sent more than one application. Fifty-three
qualified15 pilots were offered a position, 16 accepted employment, and
37 declined. Of the 37 that declined, 24 stated that the low starting
salary was the main reason for declining. Low salary could play an even
more significant role in the future, since a large number of the current
helicopter pilots are over the age of 50. Specifically, 33 pilots are over
the age of 50, with 5 of those over 60 years of age. With eventual
retirements, hiring qualified pilots to replace these current pilots might
prove difficult given the salary structure.
During the course of our audit fieldwork, the Command had initiated
action to address low civilian pilot salaries. In conjunction with its exit
interviews and after a study of other entities’ pilot salaries, a pay plan
adjustment request was submitted by the Department to DBM in July
2007. The pay plan adjustment requested that civilian pilot salaries be
adjusted to be comparable to trooper pilot salaries, which would equate
to more than a 20 percent increase in the top salary. According to DBM,
15 The Command requires pilots to have FAA commercial and instrument helicopter ratings,
2,000 helicopter flight hours as pilot in command and a current medical certificate.
Although not required by the Command’s FAA license, this extensive flight experience is
deemed by the Command to be a safety issue.
74 O f f ic e o f

Audits

--- Page 77 ---
approval was granted for the Department to increase civilian helicopter
pilot salaries in fiscal year 2009 by one grade, which is approximately a
seven percent salary increase (resulting in a maximum civilian helicopter
pilot salary of $74,725, including a two percent cost of living
adjustment). However, this adjustment still leaves the Command’s
civilian pilot salaries significantly below the salaries paid in the industry
and below the salaries paid to the Command’s trooper pilots. Similar
action was taken to address low technician salaries and, likewise,
approval was granted to increase these salaries in fiscal year 2009 by
one grade, increasing the maximum salary to $65,568. As with the
pilots, replacing or retaining experienced technicians in the future could
be problematic with the low salaries.
Regarding the second issue potentially influencing the retention of
civilian employees—a lack of advancement for civilian employees into
management—the Command had not taken formal action. Historically,
virtually all Command management positions have been filled by
troopers from within the Department. As previously noted, senior
Command management positions are routinely filled by troopers, even
though all maintenance technicians and about 90 percent of the
Command’s helicopter pilots are civilian employees. In addition to all of
senior management, as of December 1, 2007, we noted that all four of
the regional supervisors (each region comprises two helicopter sections),
and all eight helicopter section supervisors, were either trooper pilots or
trooper/flight paramedics.
According to the Department’s management, although there is no
requirement that supervisory or management personnel be troopers,
they acknowledge that it has been a long-standing practice to generally
fill management and supervisory positions from within the trooper ranks.
Subsequent to the conclusion of our audit fieldwork, the Department
advised us that, in May 2008, a civilian was appointed as the director of
maintenance and that, in April 2008, three technician positions were
reclassified to supervisory positions within the maintenance section.
In addition to possibly affecting the Command’s operational
effectiveness, there are large financial costs of excessive turnover. For
example, training provided to new pilots and technicians is extensive and
time-consuming and there is a considerable period before employees,
especially pilots, are fully acclimated to the Command. To the extent
that salary increases reduce turnover, the increased salary expenditures
could be at least partially offset by reduced training expenditures. For
example, the Command requires that pilots have 2,000 hours of
O ff i c e o f 75
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 78 ---
helicopter flying time before they are hired, and requires that pilots
complete further extensive training before they can work at a section.
This training includes one week in ground school training in Texas
provided by the manufacturer of the Command’s helicopters (American
Eurocopter). The training also includes flying in Command helicopters
with instructor pilots. The training takes several months to complete
and, according to our calculations, is estimated to cost more than
$100,000 per pilot. Finally, opening up or creating management
opportunities for civilian staff could free up existing troopers for other
law enforcement duties.16
23. Although supportive of the Command, certain Department
personnel actions impacted operations - During the course of our
fieldwork we became aware of certain personnel decisions that, while
not a violation of policy, could have an adverse impact on either
Command operations or related morale of Command staff.
• As of January 10, 2008, four qualified paramedics functioning in law
enforcement roles at State Police barracks had requested transfers
to fill trooper/flight paramedic vacancies. Three of these four
requests were made during the period from April 2007 through June
2007. These four requests were denied based on a consideration of
the staffing needs of the entire Field Operations Bureau. However,
since it is Command policy that flight paramedics be troopers (due to
the dual law enforcement role of the helicopters), this limits the
Command’s opportunities to fill its trooper/flight paramedic
vacancies.
• As previously noted, the Command’s technician salary range is
generally lower than that of other similar entities, which could impact
the Command’s ability to hire qualified technicians. In addition,
during recruiting, neither the Command nor DSP have unilateral
authority to adjust a salary offer above the midpoint on the salary
scale when making an offer; rather, this requires DBM approval.
Although an isolated occurrence, we noted one recent case in which
a prospective candidate, who was deemed highly qualified by the
16 This concept is not new. In January 2004, based on a request from the Chairmen of the
Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and House Committee on Appropriations, the
Office of Legislative Audits issued a performance audit report entitled “Department of State
Police Workforce Civilianization.” That report identified certain administrative and support
positions filled by troopers, which could be civilianized to free up troopers to perform law
enforcement-related activities.
76 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 79 ---
Command, requested a starting salary of $5,000 more than the
midpoint of the salary scale for the position; the Department chose
not to pursue this salary offer with DBM and the person was not
hired. Certainly, more flexibility and authority in setting
compensation could affect recruiting success.
Command management did not dispute that these two instances
impacted their operations. However, they maintain that the Department
is generally supportive of the Command and that being part of the
Department is beneficial. For example, as noted in the preceding
finding, the Department has recently assisted the Command in
increasing salaries (such as for civilian pilots).
24. The Command’s inspector supervisor position is not
independent of the maintenance functions – FAA regulations
require that certified repair stations use both inspection and supervisory
maintenance personnel and, although not specifically prescribed in
regulations, the intent appears to be that these functions be
independent from each other. However, the Command employs
inspection supervisors who have inspection responsibilities and who
also supervise maintenance technicians in the normal course of repairs.
An inspector’s main job duty is to inspect the quality of the maintenance
staff’s work to ensure it was completed properly, enabling the inspector
to certify the helicopter as flight-worthy. Because they perform both
functions, Command inspection supervisors could be placed in the
position of supervising maintenance work and certifying that same work.
This does not establish the necessary separation of these functions to
provide the desired independence. We were advised by representatives
of the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy that, at their respective facilities,
inspectors are prohibited from inspecting their own work, or work done
by employees they supervise, and that independent personnel certify all
aircraft as ready to return to service after maintenance is completed.
25. Although the Command and its maintenance staff are
recipients of FAA training awards, training enhancements are
possible - A maintenance technician training manual was developed by
the Command, effective August 2006, and the FAA approved this
manual in March 2007. The purpose of the manual is to “set forth the
procedures for the Command to identify its training needs in a
systematic manner, develop training, and/or identify existing training,
select the training methods, provide training methods, record training
O ff i c e o f 77

Audits

--- Page 80 ---
accomplishment, and measure the effectiveness of its training
program.” Our review of the training program and selected employee
training files disclosed the following conditions:
• The Command had not developed a curriculum of training courses for
technicians, as required. Although the Command had created a
form which lists the various areas of proficiency for technicians, the
Command had not formally identified the training curriculum
necessary to achieve this proficiency (such as the associated courses
or minimum course hours).
• Our review of the training files for ten randomly selected
maintenance technicians disclosed that there had been no formal
individualized assessments of training needs performed for nine out
of ten technicians tested, even though these are required by the
maintenance technician training manual as a means to tailor
individual training programs.
We did note that all ten technicians tested had a current Airframe
and Powerplant Mechanics license as well as two years of helicopter
experience or were graduates of an FAA part 147 school, as required
by the Command. (Part 147 refers to the federal regulations that
govern requirements for aircraft maintenance personnel.) Our test
also included pilots and trooper/flight paramedics, which found that
required training was provided.
Recommendations
A number of these recommendations might require actions that neither the
Command nor the Department can take unilaterally. Consequently, the
involvement or commitment of DBM and, in some cases, the General
Assembly, might be necessary to affect the desired change.
20. No Recommendation
21. We recommend that the Department evaluate its practices with respect to
management turnover and take steps to foster more stable leadership.
We also recommend that the Command develop formal qualifications for
its various management/supervisory positions.
22. We recommend that the Command develop a formal process to analyze
the reasons for staff turnover and vacancies for all non-management
positions and develop an appropriate strategy to address these issues.
78 O f f ic e o f

Audits

--- Page 81 ---
For example, exit interviews should be conducted for all employees that
resign and related summary statistics maintained. We also recommend
that the Command and the Department continue their efforts to increase
the salaries for its employees so that they are more competitive. Finally,
we recommend that the Command analyze its organizational structure to
determine whether opportunities for the advancement of qualified civilians
into management and supervisory positions can be increased.
23. We recommend that the Department evaluate its staffing practices and
decisions with respect to transfer requests and attempt to obtain more
authority and flexibility in making hiring decisions.
24. We recommend that the Command take action to identify adequate
personnel resources to separate the duties of inspection and maintenance
supervisors.
25. We recommend that the Command comply with its FAA-approved
technician training manual, including the implementation of a curriculum
addressing maintenance technician training needs.

Objective 4
Reliability of the “Golden Hour” Performance
Measure
Conclusion
This audit objective was to determine the reliability of the fiscal years 2005
and 2006 reported percentages of medevac missions completed within the
“Golden Hour.” For those years, the Department of State Police (DSP)
reported that 94.81 percent (fiscal year 2005) and 94.36 percent (fiscal year
2006) of the missions were completed within the “Golden Hour.” The
Department’s MFR (Managing for Results) goal is to complete 95 percent of
its medevac missions within the “Golden Hour.” However, as a result of the
following deficiencies, we were unable to conclude with respect to the
reliability of the reported MFR results for the “Golden Hour” for fiscal years
2005 and 2006.
Our audit disclosed that the Command had not formally defined the term
“Golden Hour” and that the underlying data supporting these reported results
were not consistent with the accepted definition of “Golden Hour.” The
University of Maryland Medical Center defines the “Golden Hour” as the hour
between injury and delivery of a patient to a trauma center. This definition is
consistent with the definition used by medical professionals. Since the
Command does not know the time of injury, it uses the time that the section
receives the medevac request from SYSCOM as the starting point of the
“Golden Hour,” which is always after the time of injury. Nevertheless, the
Command should define the term and ensure its method of measurement
conforms to this definition.
In addition, quality control procedures had not been established by the
Command to verify the accuracy of the mission times recorded in the
RightCAD database, which is the data source for MFR calculations.
Furthermore, the Command did not retain documentation supporting its MFR
calculations nor did it retain voice transmission data between SYSCOM and
the helicopter sections, which would enable a verification of the recorded
times in the RightCAD database.
Using the RightCAD database, we were able to recompile the information used
by the Command to calculate the “Golden Hour” results for fiscal years 2005
and 2006. The Department’s reported results were properly computed,
O ff i c e o f 81
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 84 ---
assuming the underlying data (such as the recorded times for each mission)
were reliable. However, based on further analysis of these data, we identified
certain questionable flight times pertaining to missions that were reportedly
flown in one hour or less as well as those that took more than one hour.
Background
As part of its annual Managing for Results (MFR) submission, the Department
reports the percentage of medevac patients delivered to the appropriate care
facility within the “Golden Hour.” According to the Command, the “Golden
Hour” starts with the receipt of the initial request to a section for a medevac
helicopter by SYSCOM. The Command’s goal for this measure is the delivery
of 95 percent of patients within the “Golden Hour.” According to the
Department’s fiscal year 2008 budget submission, the following results were
achieved for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 (most current actual results
available at the time of our audit):

Sources: Fiscal Year 2008 executive budget and RightCAD database
The underlying data for the measure contained in the RightCAD database
based on transmissions between the flight crew and SYSCOM are key times
manually recorded by SYSCOM staff. These include
1. the initial request for a medevac mission from the local responders,
2. the initial request to a section for a medevac mission from SYSCOM,
82 O f f ic e o f

--- Page 85 ---
3. the helicopter lift-off from its base,
4. the helicopter arrival at the accident scene,
5. the helicopter lift-off from the accident scene, and
6. the helicopter arrival at a trauma hospital.
To calculate the “Golden Hour” measure, the Command extracts information
from RightCAD for a given fiscal year and runs a report of all medevac
missions performed, as well as a report of all missions where the total time
between a section receiving notification from SYSCOM (2 above) and the
arrival time at a trauma hospital (6 above) is determined not to be completed
within the “GoldenHour” (non-compliant missions). The total non-compliant
missions is divided by the total number of medevac missions (also from
RightCAD) and the resultant percentage is subtracted from 100 to arrive at
the number of missions completed within the “Golden Hour.”
Findings
26. The Command has not formally defined the term “Golden
Hour,” and the accepted definition of the “Golden Hour” is not
consistent with the Command’s MFR reporting - The Command’s
use of “Golden Hour” is not consistent with the term’s accepted
definition, nor has the Command provided its own definition of the term.
The accepted definition of the “Golden Hour” is the first hour after the
occurrence of a serious accident and resultant trauma; however, the
Command does not measure the time between the occurrence of the
accident and the delivery of a patient to a trauma center, because it
does not know when the trauma occurred. Rather, the Command
actually measures the amount of time between SYSCOM’s notification to
a section that a medevac mission is needed and the time a patient is
delivered to the trauma center, which represents actions wholly under
the Command’s control. Specifically, the Command has no knowledge of
the amount of time lapsed from the occurrence of an accident to the
decision of a local emergency response team to contact SYSCOM to
request a medevac transport. Furthermore, often neither the Command
nor the initial responding ground EMT can reliably determine the precise
time that an accident occurred, which precludes the use of the accepted
“Golden Hour” definition. Nevertheless, the Command should define
the term and ensure its method of measurement conforms to this
definition.

27. The Command should establish a quality control process over
its MFR reporting process and should retain documentation
supporting the reported results - The Command did not have a
quality control review process in place to ensure the reliability of
reported MFR results, as required by the Department of Budget and
Management. Specifically, the Command did not have a system in place
to validate mission times manually recorded by SYSCOM staff in the
RightCAD database. The only independent source available to validate
the times recorded in the database is voice transmissions, which provide
a secondary time source. Voice transmissions between SYSCOM and
the helicopter sections (both via telephone while on the ground prior to
liftoff and via radio while in-flight) are recorded and include automatically
generated time stamps. The Command did not use these voice
transmissions to independently validate data recorded in RightCAD, nor
were we able to validate data recorded during fiscal years 2005 and
2006 since the voice transmissions generally were only retained for a
period of six months.
Our test results using voice transmission information for completed
missions during May and June 2007 (which were available when we
conducted our test in December 2007) suggest that verification of the
database entries is needed. Our tests of mission times for 61 medevac
missions flown during those months identified time recording errors
affecting 10 missions. Although the time differences were not significant
to the point of impacting the timeliness of those missions (that is, none
of the errors would have changed a timely mission to a non-compliant
mission), the tests results show that time recording errors do occur.
Furthermore, the Command did not retain any documentation to support
its MFR calculations for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Using the
RightCAD database we were able to recompile the components used in
calculating the MFR results, and arrived at similar results. However,
based on further analysis of these data, we identified a number of
questionable mission times pertaining to missions that were reportedly
flown in one hour or less as well as those that took more than one hour,
which could impact data reliability.
For example, Chart 6 on page 86 is a graphic representation of the total
number of medevac missions flown during fiscal year 2006 on which
that year’s “Golden Hour” reported result was based — with 35 minutes
being the most common mission length. Although not shown, the
respective fiscal year 2005 medevac mission profile is similar, also with
35 minutes being the most common mission length. Our review of the
84 O f f ic e o f
Legislative
Audits

--- Page 87 ---
underlying mission times for both years disclosed a number of missions
completed in significantly less time than is typical. For example, the
mission times for fiscal year 2006 included 242 completed missions of
20 minutes or less in duration (141 of those were completed in 10
minutes or less), out of 4,863 total completed missions. Accordingly, we
inquired of the Command as to what times might be considered
implausibly short. Command management advised us that a normal
mission consists of four distinct components: helicopter launch from its
base, flight time to the accident site, time on the ground at the site, and
flight time to the trauma center. Each of the four segments has an
expected time duration; approximate durations are as follows:
Launch procedures 7 minutes
Flight time to scene 6 minutes
Time on ground at scene 10 minutes
Flight time to trauma center 6 minutes
Total approximate mission duration 29 minutes
Although these times are subject to number of factors (including more
time on the ground due to patient extraction from a vehicle or
performance of an advanced medical procedure on the ground by the
trooper/flight paramedic), they should represent a typical scenario for a
completed mission. Additionally, launch and flight times could be
shortened if a call is received if a helicopter is already airborne and is
returning to its base from a previous mission. Nevertheless, the
reliability of missions completed in less than 10 or even 20 minutes, as
recorded in RightCAD, based on the above times is questionable.
Command management advised us that such abnormally short missions
could likely be due to incorrectly recording cancelled missions as
completed missions. A further cause for these abnormally short mission
times could be incorrect time recordings as disclosed in the results of
our aforementioned test of completed missions.

With respect to the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 missions that reportedly
exceeded one hour, we identified several data recordation errors as well
as a logic problem; however, collectively these errors did not significantly
impact the reported MFR results for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. For
example, we identified three missions for fiscal year 2005 with total
mission times that exceeded 21 hours each (an obvious error).
Accordingly, the Command should establish quality control procedures,
independently verify critical RightCAD data, and retain documentation to
support its MFR calculations.
Recommendations
26. We recommend that the Command define the term “Golden Hour” used in
its MFR submission and ensure that the information actually measured
and reported is in agreement with the definition.

27. We recommend that the Command establish a quality control process to
ensure the accuracy of the reported MFR results. For example, the
Command should periodically conduct independent tests to verify critical
RightCAD data (for example, using secondary time sources such as voice
transmissions to verify mission times). We also recommend that the
Command retain documentation to support its MFR calculations and
related tests.

simulator in a future Request For Procurement to purchase a new fleet or
extend the life of the current fleet. The Request For Procurement is
expected to be advertised in October 2008.
Timeline: Efforts are ongoing and will continue through the
upgrade/replacement process.

6. Audit Report: No recommendation
7. Audit Report: No recommendation
8. Audit Report: We recommend that the Command develop a system for
tracking detailed cost data for helicopter operations, including a process

--- Page 104 ---
to track labor hours for specific maintenance and inspection tasks. We
also recommend that the Command use these data, as well as any other
reputable sources, to create performance benchmarks and to monitor unit
and employee performance. We further recommend that the Command
use these data to perform an analysis of the adequacy of the size and
composition of the maintenance staff.
Aviation Command Response: The Aviation Command agrees with the
recommendation.
The implementation of the recommendation will require extensive study
and will most likely involve the need to identify additional funds to develop
such a system. The Command will research the fiscal feasibility to
develop a system for tracking detailed cost data for helicopter operations,
including a process to track labor hours for specific maintenance and
inspection tasks. Once developed, the Command will use these data, as
well as any other reputable sources, to create performance benchmarks
and to monitor unit and employee performance. The Command will also
use these data to perform an analysis of the adequacy of the size and
composition of the maintenance staff.

Maintenance Information Systems
11. Audit Report: We recommend that the Command implement procedures
to help ensure the timeliness of parts delivery. Specifically, MxManager
should be used to determine the appropriate stock levels for critical parts
and supplies, to order critical parts and supplies using the appropriate
stock levels, and to track the timeliness of parts deliveries. In addition,
the Command should continue its periodic contact with parts
manufacturers in conjunction with a process to account for all open
orders, and should consider establishing a guaranteed maintenance
program with manufacturers to obtain parts in a timely manner.
Aviation Command Response: The Aviation Command agrees with the
recommendation.
The Command will develop a policy and implement a process to expand
on its use of MxManager in order to determine the appropriate stock
levels for critical parts and supplies, to order critical parts and supplies
using the appropriate stock levels, and to track the timeliness of parts

Objective 3
Personnel, Staffing, and Training
Recommendations
A number of these recommendations might require actions that neither the
Command nor the Department can take unilaterally. Consequently, the
involvement or commitment of DBM and, in some cases, the General
Assembly, might be necessary to affect the desired change.
20. Audit Report: No Recommendation
21. Audit Report: We recommend that the Department evaluate its practices
with respect to management turnover and take steps to foster more stable
leadership. We also recommend that the Command develop formal
qualifications for its various management/supervisory positions.
Aviation Command Response: The Aviation Command disagrees with the
finding and the recommendation.
The Command has only had three commanders in the past 12 years. One
of those commanders retired after serving seven and one half years as
the commander and another retired after serving as the commander for
approximately three years. The current commander has been assigned to
the Command for over the past one and one half years. The Command
does not consider this to be a high turnover rate and would be
comparable to other professional and military organizations.
The turnover rate of experienced employees transferred out of the
command is not significantly high. In most cases, these employees
ultimately return to the Command as more well rounded managers after
gaining invaluable experience on a more global operational perspective.
There were four (4) instances over the period covered by the audit where
former aviation employees returned to the command in senior
management positions.
The Command has developed formal qualifications for many of its
command, supervisory, and key positions that are technical in nature, and
therefore require technical expertise or experience. Examples of these
positions include chief pilot, instructor pilot, aviation manager (formally

--- Page 110 ---
known as director of maintenance), chief inspector, production control
supervisor, material expeditor, and lead technician.
The qualifications of 19 key personnel holding key administrative/support
positions are evident through the fact that they actively fly as primary crew
members aboard Aviation Command aircraft. Seven of the 19 are pilots
and the remaining 12 are trooper flight paramedics. On average, these
individuals have 8-12 years experience as a flight crew member. This
experience is mission/job specific flight experience providing insight and
decision making skills applicable to all aspects of the Command’s mission
profile.
The Command has placed civilian and sworn pilots, trooper flight
paramedics, and maintenance technicians in key staff positions and they
all have direct access to the commander; this is reflected in the latest
organizational structure. The Command has civilian and sworn pilots,
trooper flight paramedics, and maintenance technicians, who serve as
aviation advisors on the Standardization and Risk Management Council
which is responsible for focusing on safety, training, and maintenance and
flight operations policies. The Council is also responsible for providing
recommendations for approval and implementation.
Additionally, the Secretary of the State Police, through his authority and
responsibility detailed in Title 2 of the Public Safety Article, establishes the
organization of the Department, and assigns and reassigns employees of
the Department to the duties, units, and regional facilities of the
Department as he considers necessary to serve the needs of the
Department and the public. Senior management positions within the
Command are administrative in nature and do not require technical
expertise in order to perform these functions. Strong management skills
are the most important prerequisite for these positions. Consequently, by
law it is the Secretary’s prerogative and under his authority to assign
personnel to those senior management positions which he deems will
serve in the best interest of the Command and the Department.
Finally, although the audit report does accurately state that civilian
employees are eligible for full retirement benefits after 30 years of
service, it should be noted that civilian pilots are eligible for retirement
after 25 years.
22. We recommend that the Command develop a formal process to analyze
the reasons for staff turnover and vacancies for all non-management
positions and develop an appropriate strategy to address these issues.
For example, exit interviews should be conducted for all employees that
resign and related summary statistics maintained. We also recommend

--- Page 111 ---
that the Command and the Department continue their efforts to increase
the salaries for its employees so that they are more competitive. Finally,
we recommend that the Command analyze its organizational structure to
determine whether opportunities for the advancement of qualified civilians
into management and supervisory positions can be increased.
Aviation Command Response: The Aviation Command agrees with the
recommendation.
The Command will develop a formal process to analyze the reasons for
staff turnover and vacancies for all non-management positions and
develop an appropriate strategy, if warranted, to address these issues.
Exit interviews shall be conducted for all employees that resign and
related summary statistics maintained.
Despite the fact that all civilian pilots and instructor pilots, and all
maintenance technicians, lead technicians, and technician supervisors
received a one grade increase in July 2008, the Command will continue to
monitor recruitment and retention rates of employees to determine if
salaries have a negative impact in the hiring and retention of employees
in the future. If data exists in the future to indicate that salaries negatively
impact recruitment and retention of qualified employees, the Command
will take steps to request increase in salaries so that they are more
competitive.
The Command has and will continue to analyze its organizational structure
to determine whether opportunities for the advancement of qualified
civilians into management and supervisory positions and other key
positions can be increased. For example, the Command recently created
a chief pilot position that was staffed by a civilian pilot, the Command
created five lead maintenance technician positions that were staffed by
civilian technicians, the Command created a production control supervisor
position that was staffed by a civilian technician, and the Command is
currently studying the creation of a director of operations position that
would be filled by a civilian pilot.

23. We recommend that the Department evaluate its staffing practices and
decisions with respect to transfer requests and attempt to obtain more
authority and flexibility in making hiring decisions.
Aviation Command Response: The Department agrees with the
recommendation.
The Department has and will continue to evaluate its staffing practices
and decisions with respect to transfer requests to ensure optimal staffing
levels to meet all to the Department’s legal and mandated obligations. All
hiring decisions are guided by personnel rule and law.

24. We recommend that the Command take action to identify adequate
personnel resources to separate the duties of inspection and maintenance
supervisors.
Aviation Command Response: The Aviation Command agrees with the
recommendation.

Objective 4
Reliability of the “Golden Hour” Performance
Measure
Recommendations
26. We recommend that the Command define the term “Golden Hour” used in
its MFR submission and ensure that the information actually measured
and reported is in agreement with the definition.
Aviation Command Response: The Aviation Command agrees with the
recommendation.
The Aviation Command’s most recent MFR submission defined the
“Dispatch to Hospital 60 Minute Threshold” as being the time it takes
from when a helicopter Section receives a dispatch request from SYSCOM
(dispatch time) until the time a patient arrives at a trauma center (hospital
arrival time). The Command’s goal or threshold is to accomplish this scene
medevac mission within 60 minutes of SYSCOM dispatch time to hospital
arrival time.
Many factors beyond the control of the Aviation Command, such as the
extrication of a patient entrapped in a vehicle, contribute to a patient’s
arrival time at a hospital.
Timeline: Recommendation has been implemented.
27. We recommend that the Command establish a quality control process to
ensure the accuracy of the reported MFR results. For example, the
Command should periodically conduct independent tests to verify critical
RightCAD data (for example, using secondary time sources such as voice
transmissions to verify mission times). We also recommend that the
Command retain documentation to support its MFR calculations and
related tests.
Aviation Command Response: The Aviation Command agrees with the
recommendation.
The Command will develop a policy and implement a process to establish
a quality control process to ensure the accuracy of the reported MFR

--- Page 114 ---
results. A part of this policy will include the retention of documentation to
support the Command’s MFR calculations and related tests.
