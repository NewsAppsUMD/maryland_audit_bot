Background Information
DoIT Overview and Responsibilities
The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) was established by Chapter
9, Laws of Maryland 2008 effective July 1, 2008. DoIT is responsible for the
State’s information technology policies, procedures, and standards, and for
overseeing the implementation of major information technology projects for
the State’s Executive Branch agencies and commissions.1 DoIT is also
responsible for reviewing, determining the value of, and approving
telecommunication resource sharing agreements (RSAs) with these State
agencies. Furthermore, DoIT manages the Major Information Technology
Development Project (MITDP) Fund, into which monetary compensation from
certain State agency RSAs is required to be deposited. Finally, DoIT
coordinates, purchases, and manages information technology and
telecommunications services for certain State agencies.
The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) – Office of Information
Technology was responsible for the information technology functions of the
Executive Branch, including management of RSAs, prior to the creation of
DoIT.
Maryland’s Resource Sharing Law
The State’s telecommunications RSA process was established by Chapter 87,
Laws of Maryland 1996 to allow State agencies to enter into contractual
agreements with private companies for the non-exclusive, long-term use of
State rights-of-way (land), communications infrastructure (telecommunication
towers), and real estate (buildings). Generally, RSAs permit private
companies to install, operate, and maintain communications systems on
State resources and, in exchange, the private companies provide the State
with monetary compensation, equipment, or services. The law also required
that monetary compensation from certain agencies’ RSAs be deposited into a
special fund, known as the Information Technology Investment Fund,
maintained by DBM.
Chapter 467, Laws of Maryland 2002 replaced the Information Technology
Investment Fund with the MITDP Fund, a special fund within DBM’s Office of
1 By Law, DoIT does not have authority or responsibility for the University System of Maryland,
Morgan State University, St. Mary’s College, or the Maryland Port Administration.
Additionally, Chapter 150 of the Laws of Maryland 2018, effective July 1, 2018, exempts
the Maryland Stadium Authority from DoIT’s authority or responsibility.
7

--- Page 10 ---
Information Technology (now known as DoIT). This law provides that the
MITDP Fund is to be used to support the State’s major information technology
development projects.
Chapter 137, Laws of Maryland 2014 requires monies from
telecommunications RSAs and from the sale, lease, or exchange of
communication sites, communication facilities, or communication frequencies
be deposited into the MITDP Fund and be used only to support the operation
of networkMaryland, the State’s information technology communications
network.
This Law also provides that compensation received from RSAs with the
Maryland Department of Transportation, Maryland Transportation Authority,
Maryland Public Broadcasting Commission/Maryland Public Television, and
agencies within the Judicial and Legislative branches of State government is
retained by these agencies and is not deposited into the MITDP Fund.
Maryland’s Wireless and Broadband Telecommunications
Infrastructure Under DoIT
DoIT maintains and supports three critical communication infrastructure
systems (1) the construction of telecommunication towers, (2) the
maintenance and expansion of the State’s communications fiber optic
network called networkMaryland, and (3) a statewide radio communication
system for first responders called Maryland First. DoIT’s goal for these
communication infrastructure systems is to improve broadband access for
State agencies and critical local community institutions (such as, schools,
libraries, hospitals, and public safety agencies).
DoIT is also working to expand the availability of broadband services for the
citizens of Maryland, especially in underserved areas, to help further the
State’s long-term vision to provide affordable high speed internet service to
every Maryland home by the year 2022. To help meet this goal, there have
been several recent statutory, policy, and organizational changes.
 The Task Force on Rural Internet, Broadband, Wireless, and Cellular
Service was established by Chapter 621, Laws of Maryland 2017 (known
as the Connecting Rural Maryland Act of 2017). The Task Force comprises
representatives from the General Assembly, DoIT, the Department of
Commerce, the Public Service Commission, local government entities, and
individuals from telecommunication industries. The main objective of the
Task Force is to explore ways these representatives can work together to
8

--- Page 11 ---
obtain federal assistance for improving rural internet, broadband, wireless,
and cellular service, and to assess connectivity and coverage issues. On
January 9, 2018, the Task Force issued a report that offered the following
recommendations to address accessibility to broadband in rural areas:
 Review and implement statutory and regulatory changes to reduce
obstacles and permitting challenges between private providers and
State government.
 Perform a complete inventory of all State and local government agency
assets including cellular towers, water towers, and other structures.
 Update mapping capability to calculate the overall cost for universal
service for the last mile of broadband and include a complete survey of
population and business density for underserved and unserved areas
in each county. Local governments should be asked to help identify
and prioritize unserved and underserved areas with opportunities for
input by the Internet service providers.
 Continue the Task Force for an additional year in order to address the
development of a business and funding model for rural broadband
deployment and to identify potential funding sources other than
federal grants and financing options.
 A Governor’s Executive Order, effective June 27, 2017, established the
Office of Rural Broadband within DoIT to help improve the access to high
speed internet throughout the State. The Office will identify opportunities
for productive partnerships, including public-private partnerships that
enable sharing of resources. The Office exists to assist local jurisdictions
in improving their access to high-speed internet, identify sources of funds
for these services (including federal funds), and help local jurisdictions
apply for these funds.
Process for Creating Resource Sharing Agreements
In general, the process for creating an RSA under DoIT’s jurisdiction involves
the following steps established by State law.
1. Companies submit a proposal for a resource sharing opportunity to an
individual State agency or to DoIT. These proposals may be unsolicited or
may result from statewide solicitations for resource sharing.
9

--- Page 12 ---
2. State agencies are required to notify DoIT of each RSA proposal and, in
consultation with DoIT, review the proposal and determine if it has
economic merit, is advantageous to the agency, or has a benefit to the
State.
3. DoIT reviews, values, and approves each proposal and posts it on
eMaryland Marketplace for a 30-day period if valued at $100,000 or
more.
4. Each DoIT-approved proposal valued at $100,000 or more is submitted to
the Legislative Policy Committee (LPC) for a 60-day review and comment
period. This serves as an extra level of oversight for these unique
agreements for the sharing of State-owned resources with private
companies involving compensation to the State.
5. DoIT submits the LPC-approved proposal (when valued at $200,000 or
greater) to the Board of Public Works for final review and approval.
Common Types of Resource Sharing Arrangements
The four primary examples of telecommunications resource sharing
arrangements identified during our audit include a private company
1. leasing space to install equipment on a State tower,
2. installing fiber optic cable across state property (such as, highway
rights-of-way, bridges, and State park land),
3. leasing State-owned land or buildings to install towers and other
wireless communication equipment (collocation), and
4. collocating of private infrastructure on State property (such as an
information technology company leasing space from a utility company
on an electric transmission tower that is located on State land).
See Figure 1 for examples of each of these RSAs.
There are other less common examples of resource sharing such as the sale
or exchange of intangible wireless communication frequencies or television
broadcasting channels, as permitted by the Federal Communications
Commission.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Audit Scope
We conducted a performance audit to evaluate the State’s use and oversight
of telecommunications resource sharing agreements2 (RSAs) between State
agencies and private companies. The audit also included determining if the
State was marketing resource sharing opportunities to maximize their benefit.
RSAs provide for the non-exclusive, long-term use of State rights-of-way,
communications infrastructure, and real estate by private companies to
install, operate, and maintain communication systems. In return, the private
companies provide monetary compensation, communications equipment, or
services to the State.
This audit was initiated as a result of concerns identified during our Special
Review of Resource Sharing Lease Agreements issued on November 18,
2016, as further described on page 15 of this report. This Special Review
focused on 10 agreements for which the related compensation was deposited
into “off-budget” escrow accounts. The special review disclosed that the
Department of Information Technology (DoIT) did not maintain comprehensive
records of RSAs, nor did it effectively monitor the State’s resource sharing
program.
The scope of our current audit was limited to RSAs with State agencies under
DoIT’s authority. Our audit included the State’s RSAs that were in effect, at
least in part, during the period from January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2017.
Our audit did not include the following entities which, under State law, are
excluded from DoIT’s authority or responsibility: University System of
Maryland, St. Mary’s College of Maryland, Morgan State University, Maryland
Department of Transportation - Maryland Port Administration, and all Judicial
and Legislative branch agencies. Furthermore, although Chapter 150 of the
2018 Laws of Maryland exempts the Maryland Stadium Authority from DoIT’s
authority or responsibility effective July 1, 2018, our audit scope did not
exclude MSA since the legislation was approved and became effective after
our audit fieldwork.
Finally, our audit did not include the State’s RSAs with other governmental
entities (federal, State, and local jurisdictions). Those arrangements are
2 These agreements are referred to differently by the various agencies included in our audit
but are all similar in nature. For the purposes of this report, we used the term Resource
Sharing Agreement or RSA rather than using the terminology adopted by different State
agencies.
12

generally established through written agreements (such as a Memorandum of
Understanding) and do not include conditions for compensation.
We conducted this audit under the authority of the State Government Article,
Section 2-1221 of the Annotated Code of Maryland and performed it in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence
obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based
on our audit objectives.
Objectives and Methodology
Our audit included the following five objectives, which are discussed in more
detail in the respective sections of this report:
1. To determine if DoIT has established comprehensive policies and
procedures to guide agencies regarding the execution, control, and
monitoring of RSAs, and to determine if DoIT and State agencies maintain
comprehensive lists of resources (telecommunication towers and fiber
optic cables) and RSAs.
2. To determine if compensation from RSAs was properly received and all
monetary compensation was deposited into the appropriate accounts by
State agencies in accordance with State law.
3. To determine if the State is marketing resource sharing opportunities to
maximize revenues and to help achieve statewide telecommunications
infrastructure goals.
4. To determine if the State’s RSAs contain key provisions designed to
address significant risks and were properly executed, documented,
renewed, and approved in accordance with State law.
5. To determine if State agencies are maintaining records of private
equipment on State-owned telecommunication towers.
As previously mentioned, our November 2016 report entitled Special Review
of Resource Sharing Lease Agreements disclosed that DoIT did not maintain
comprehensive records of RSAs at that time. Accordingly, to accomplish our
objectives, we first needed to identify existing RSAs maintained by State
agencies under DoIT’s authority.
To do so, we first identified the following 21 agencies that are subject to
DoIT’s authority under State law and have resources (telecommunication
towers, land, and buildings) for potential resource sharing.
13

2. Department of Agriculture (MDA) Television (MPBC)
3. Department of General Services (DGS) 14. Maryland Stadium Authority (MSA)
4. Department of Information Technology 15. Military Department (DMIL)
(DoIT) 16. State Department of Education (MSDE)
5. Department of Juvenile Services (DJS)
6. Department of Natural Resources Maryland Department of
(DNR) Transportation (MDOT)
7. Department of Public Safety and 17. Maryland Aviation Administration

8. Department of State Police (DSP) 18. Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)
9. Department of the Environment (MDE) 19. Maryland Transportation Authority
10. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) (MdTA)
11. Maryland Department of Health (MDH) 20. Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA)
12. Maryland Institute for Emergency 21. State Highway Administration (SHA)
Medical Services Systems (MIEMSS)
At each of these agencies, we contacted personnel responsible for finance,
real estate, and information technology/wireless communications to
determine if agreements or arrangements existed with private companies for
resource sharing (including leases, right-of-way or entry agreements,
easements, utility permits, special permits, or licenses). We also reviewed
available records at DoIT and obtained records of RSAs from the Board of
Public Works (BPW) and the Legislative Policy Committee, which are involved
in reviewing and approving certain RSAs.
As shown in Table 1 on the following page, our research identified 141 RSAs
involving 11 of these 21 State entities, including DoIT, with estimated
compensation (monetary compensation, equipment, services, or a
combination thereof) totaling $264.1 million over the total term of the
agreement, including renewal options (hereinafter referred to as lifetime
compensation). The estimated lifetime compensation values of the
agreements were determined based on available information (such as,
language in the agreement, BPW agenda documents) and our calculations.
We included agreements that were active at some point during the period
from January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2017. These agreements were
established both prior and subsequent to the creation of the State’s resource
sharing law. As of June 30, 2017, 126 agreements totaling $258.1 million
were active and 15 agreements totaling $5.9 million had expired.
Personnel from the remaining 10 agencies advised us that they did not have
any RSAs and our research did not identify any RSAs at these remaining
agencies. We performed detailed reviews and testing at each of these 11
agencies to assess their record keeping and procedures over the RSAs.

Finally, to identify best practices regarding resource sharing, we interviewed
personnel at selected county government agencies and other states that had
resource sharing activities.
We conducted tests, analyses, inspections of documents and records,
observations, and site visits, as we deemed necessary to achieve our
objectives. Generally, agreements and related transactions were selected for
testing based on auditor judgment, which primarily considers risk. Neither
statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was used to select the
agreements tested. Therefore, the results of the tests cannot be used to
project those results to the entire population from which the test items were
selected.
Special Review of Resource Sharing Lease Agreements
On November 18, 2016, we issued a report on our Special Review of
Resource Sharing Lease Agreements. The Special Review focused on 10
resource sharing lease agreements for which compensation was deposited
into escrow accounts maintained by a law firm outside of State control. Under
15

--- Page 18 ---
these agreements, DoIT, DNR, and DSP received compensation from
telecommunication companies for the use of the State’s communications
infrastructure, such as the installation of private communication systems on
State-owned towers. From February 2001 through June 2016, the companies
deposited lease payments totaling $4.4 million into the escrow accounts and
the payments were subsequently used by DNR and DSP to acquire equipment
and services totaling $3.8 million.
Our review concluded that the agreements were not effectively monitored, the
lease payments were not properly accounted for and controlled, and
purchases of equipment and services using these funds were not properly
controlled and accounted for. The report contained findings and
recommendations to all three agencies. According to follow-up
correspondence we received from these agencies, as of February 2018, these
agencies either were in the process of implementing the recommendations or
had advised us that they were waiting to do so after receipt of the results and
recommendations of this report. On August 4, 2017, in accordance with our
recommendations, the escrow accounts were closed and the law firm issued a
check to DoIT totaling $870,174, which was deposited into the MITDP Fund.
Based on our calculation, these 10 agreements have an estimated lifetime
compensation value of $8 million and are included in the 141 resource
sharing agreements we identified as reflected in Table 1. Since the State
agencies were still in the process of resolving the escrow account issue during
this audit, we did not perform specific test work related to these 10
agreements.
Fieldwork and Agency Response
Our fieldwork was completed during the period from September 2016 to
September 2017. The responses from DoIT and the agencies selected for
review during this audit are included as an appendix to this report. As
prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, we will advise DoIT and these agencies regarding the
results of our review of their responses.
16

Findings and Recommendations
Objective 1 – Policies and Procedures
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to determine if the Department of Information Technology
(DoIT) had established comprehensive policies and procedures to guide
agencies regarding the execution, control, and monitoring of resource sharing
agreements (RSAs), and to determine if DoIT and the State agencies maintain
comprehensive lists of resources (telecommunication towers and fiber optic
cables) and RSAs.
To accomplish this objective, we interviewed State agency personnel at the 11
State agencies we identified that had 141 active RSAs during the period
reviewed, as detailed in Table 1 on page 15 of this report. Additionally, see
Table 2 below which summarizes the RSAs at each State agency by the type of
agreement.

Specifically, we inquired with DoIT about its policies and procedures regarding
the execution, control, and monitoring of RSAs. With respect to DoIT in
particular, we requested a comprehensive list of RSAs for which it was the
responsible oversight agency. Furthermore, we determined if DoIT and the
other State agencies maintained comprehensive lists of their RSAs and
comprehensive inventories of State-owned telecommunication towers and
fiber optic cables for potential resource sharing. Finally, we reviewed policies
and procedures of other state and local governments to identify best practices
for resource sharing.
Conclusion
DoIT did not establish comprehensive policies and procedures for resource
sharing agreement execution, control, and monitoring. In addition, neither
DoIT nor certain State agencies maintained comprehensive lists of approved
RSAs and State resources (telecommunication towers and fiber optic cables)
available for resource sharing.
Findings
Finding 1
DoIT had not established comprehensive policies to guide State agencies on
the proper execution, control, and monitoring of RSAs.
Analysis
DoIT had not established comprehensive policies to guide State agencies on
the proper execution, control, and monitoring of RSAs. DoIT’s website
provided the only guidance for State agencies including (a) a checklist of
information agencies should include in an RSA proposal, (b) a template of a
standard RSA, (c) a flowchart of the steps involved in establishing and
approving an RSA, and (d) a statewide solicitation for RSA proposals, which
had expired in 2005. This guidance did not include key elements we
identified as necessary to ensure RSAs were properly developed and
monitored including:
 A description of the types of agreements covered under the State’s
resource sharing law. During this audit, we identified several agreements
that met the legal definition of an RSA but State agencies did not treat
them as such nor involve DoIT in the review, evaluation, and approval
process. For example, agencies executed telecommunications related
agreements in various forms such as lease, right-of-way, utility permit,
special permit, and license that should have been treated as RSAs. (See
Findings 4 and 10.)
18

--- Page 21 ---
 A description of the methodology for determining the value of RSAs and for
establishing appropriate annual compensation escalation clauses to
maximize the State’s revenue. During our audit, we identified several
examples of agreements for which compensation was not maximized (see
Findings 5 and 11).
 Standards for determining the duration of RSAs and for establishing
renewal options. We identified several agreements that were not properly
renewed (see Finding 11).
 Specific instructions and expectations for ensuring monetary
compensation is received in accordance with the RSAs and deposited into
the appropriate accounts. We identified several agreements in which
monetary compensation was not properly received and/or deposited into
the MITDP Fund as required by State law (see Findings 5 and 6).
 A delineation of DoIT and State agency respective responsibilities for
monitoring compliance with the RSAs.
During this audit, we observed that the lack of comprehensive RSA policies
resulted in subjective interpretations of the applicability and use of the State
resource sharing law. We believe this contributed to the numerous
deficiencies we noted at DoIT and State agencies with the execution, control,
and monitoring of RSAs as described in the subsequent findings in this report.
Recommendation 1
We recommend DoIT establish comprehensive policies to guide State
agencies in the proper execution, control, and monitoring of RSAs that
incorporate, at a minimum, the elements noted above.
Finding 2
DoIT and most State agencies did not maintain comprehensive records of
RSAs.
Analysis
DoIT, as part of its oversight of RSAs, did not maintain a comprehensive
record or copies of the RSAs that it approved, and did not have a mechanism
for agencies to periodically report (such as, annually) the status of
telecommunications RSAs to ensure it was aware of all new RSAs that should
have been subject to its review. In addition, only MdTA and MPBC/MPT had
comprehensive lists of their RSAs. While MSDE, BCCC, and MAA only had
19

--- Page 22 ---
limited numbers of RSAs which they generally were tracking, DoIT and the
remaining five agencies did not maintain comprehensive, centralized lists of
their agencies’ RSAs. Rather, the records at these agencies were maintained
on a decentralized basis by the specific agency units responsible for the RSAs
and all RSAs may not have been identified. We identified 100 RSAs valued at
$179.7 million for the six agencies that did not maintain comprehensive lists
of their RSAs (DoIT, SHA, MTA, MSA, DNR, and DSP).
As of September 2016, DoIT’s master list of RSAs included only 39 of the 141
RSAs we identified through our research. These 39 RSAs, which included only
two of DoIT’s own 6 agreements, had a cumulative estimated lifetime value
totaling $36.1 million. We identified 102 additional agreements with a
cumulative estimated lifetime value totaling $228.0 million that were not
included in DoIT’s master list. DoIT management advised us that it was not
aware of the other RSAs and had not established a monitoring process to
determine if agencies entered into RSAs without its knowledge. However,
DoIT should have been aware of at least 26 of the remaining 102 RSAs
totaling $184 million since DoIT had reviewed, valued, and approved these
agreements.
The lack of comprehensive lists of RSAs contributed to the failure to collect
monetary compensation and properly deposit RSA funds into the MITDP Fund
(Findings 5 and 6). In addition, the lack of comprehensive lists may have
contributed to the failure of State agencies to properly execute RSA renewals
as noted in Finding 11. In May 2018, at DoIT’s request, we provided DoIT with
the list of 141 RSAs (including the agreement documents) we compiled during
our audit.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that
a. DoIT and the applicable State agencies maintain a comprehensive list of
all RSAs for which they are responsible, and copies of the related
agreements; and
b. DoIT direct agencies to periodically (such as, annually) report the status of
all active RSAs.

Finding 3
DoIT and certain State agencies lacked comprehensive inventories of State-
owned telecommunication towers and fiber optic cables for potential resource
sharing.
Analysis
DoIT and certain State agencies (DNR, DSP, MIEMSS, and MDOT) lacked
comprehensive inventories of State-owned telecommunication towers and
fiber optic cables available for potential resource sharing purposes. Without a
comprehensive inventory of these resources, DoIT and other State agencies
could not effectively identify resource sharing opportunities to maximize
revenues and to help achieve statewide telecommunications infrastructure
goals.
State-Owned Telecommunication Towers
According to DoIT and State agency records, during fiscal years 2000 through
2017, there were 77 State-owned telecommunication towers constructed at a
cost of approximately $35.5 million. See Figure 2 for the three main types of
telecommunication towers. Although DoIT was responsible for constructing
many of these towers, it did not maintain an accurate and comprehensive
inventory of the towers it constructed. Additionally, DoIT did not maintain an
inventory of towers constructed by individual state agencies. Because DoIT
and the agencies had no inventory of towers, during the audit we used various
methods to try to construct a statewide inventory.
21

from 100 to 400 feet tall. ranging in height from 100 to
more than 2,000 feet tall.
In 2005, the Department of Budget of Management’s Office of Information
Technology (now DoIT) paid a vendor $441,200 to conduct a statewide
telecommunication tower site audit and to develop a database to track the
inventory of equipment on the State’s telecommunication towers. However,
the database was not being maintained or used by DoIT and, therefore, we
contacted the vendor to obtain a copy of it. While the database contained
appropriate information about each tower (such as location, equipment on the
tower, and information about the site), a DoIT management employee advised
us that State agency personnel did not keep the database current and
therefore it was never fully used as a tool to maximize resource sharing
revenues.
Because DoIT and the agencies had no inventory of towers, we requested
DoIT to construct a statewide tower inventory. In January 2017, DoIT provided
us with a newly compiled inventory reflecting 176 State-owned towers based
on various records dating back to the 1970s. The inventory contained towers
that were 100 feet tall or greater since structures less than this were
generally not towers but antennas mounted on other structures. Our review of
22

--- Page 25 ---
DoIT’s inventory disclosed certain inaccuracies. Specifically, we determined
that information for some towers was incomplete, certain tower locations
were incorrect, and some towers were duplicated, were not State-owned, or
no longer existed. After adjusting for these issues, DoIT's inventory reflected
131 State-owned towers.
Using the inventory prepared by DoIT in conjunction with additional research
we performed, we identified a total of 170 State-owned towers, including 6
towers that were under planning or construction by DoIT to support the
Maryland First interoperability radio project. Specifically, we developed our
own inventory of State-owned telecommunication towers (100 feet tall or
greater and all DNR Forestry Fire Towers regardless of height since they could
potentially be used for resource sharing opportunities) using DoIT records,
State agency inventory records, interviews with State agency personnel,
publicly available internet maps, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) tower registration database, and other records. As shown in Table 3, 26
of the 170 towers have 52 active RSAs valued at $54 million, including 6
RSAs valued at $5.1 million on 3 towers not identified on DoIT’s list. The
remaining 144 towers could potentially be used for resource sharing purposes
depending on available space, rated engineering load capacity, and the
desirability of the location for telecommunication companies.

Fiber Optic Cable
DoIT and MDOT did not maintain a comprehensive database of fiber installed
by the State and fiber accessed through RSAs. DoIT and MDOT are
responsible for installing and maintaining much of the State’s fiber
infrastructure through networkMaryland and MDOT’s Intelligent
Transportation System3 and related fiber networks.
Our review disclosed that DoIT and MDOT did not coordinate with each other
to ensure the State maintained an accurate and comprehensive database of
State-owned fiber. In addition, these agencies could not readily identify how
much of this fiber was currently unused. This is important since unused fiber,
known as dark fiber, could be leased to other entities to generate revenue or
3 The Intelligent Transportation System is a system that utilizes technology to improve safety
and mobility on the State’s roadways and includes the Coordinated Highways Action
Response Team (CHART).
24

--- Page 27 ---
could be used by the State to further its fiber infrastructure without paying for
the installation of new fiber in the same area.
While we could not develop a complete list of accessible fiber because of the
lack of records, we developed a list of fiber that we became aware of using
the RSAs we identified. As shown in Table 4, we identified 45 RSAs valued at
$121.5 million that were for private entities to install fiber on State property in
return for cash compensation and/or fiber (the value of these RSAs did not
always provide a cash value for the fiber provided to the State as
compensation). This included 11 RSAs under which the State acquired
access to 1,043 miles of fiber for its own use. The State could use the fiber
directly or lease unused fiber to private entities. As of June 2017, the State
had not fully used all of this fiber. For example, SHA had not used 62 percent
of the fiber it obtained, including 131 miles of fiber obtained in 3 agreements
that had never been used even though the fiber had been available for
periods ranging from 6 to 20 years. Subsequent to our review, MDOT hired an
individual to coordinate MDOT’s fiber resources, including tracking RSAs
related to fiber.

Recommendation 3
We recommend DoIT and the State agencies
a. develop and maintain comprehensive inventory databases of State-owned
telecommunication towers and fiber optic cables; and
b. use the inventory databases to plan for resource sharing opportunities
(such as, space on telecommunication towers available for lease and
unused fiber optic cable) and to achieve statewide telecommunications
infrastructure goals.
Objective 2 – Compensation
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to determine if compensation from RSAs was properly
received and all monetary compensation was deposited into the appropriate
accounts by State agencies in accordance with State law.
We inquired with State agencies and performed other research to determine if
they had permits, rights-of-way, or collocation agreements that met the
definition of a resource sharing arrangement but were not processed as RSAs.
Additionally, we reviewed 131 of the 141 RSA agreements at the 11 State
agencies that we identified, as detailed in Table 2 on page 17, to determine
the compensation that was to be received under each RSA. (We excluded the
10 RSAs addressed in our November 2016 Special Review of Resource
Sharing Lease Agreements, as explained on page 15.) We identified 113
RSAs at 10 State agencies that had provisions for monetary compensation
totaling $27.6 million. For each RSA, we compared the expected monetary
compensation according to the RSA provisions with the actual amounts
received during fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017. We also determined if
compensation received was deposited in accordance with State law. For each
of the remaining 18 RSAs that had compensation in the form of
communications equipment and services, we determined if the agencies
received the compensation in accordance with the RSA by reviewing
documentation and performing site visits.
Conclusion
We determined that State agencies did not treat certain agreements as RSAs
even though the agreements were consistent with the descriptions in law,
potentially resulting in the failure to receive or maximize compensation.
Additionally, monetary compensation was not always received in accordance
with the RSAs because State agencies did not properly monitor the RSAs or
were not aware of their existence. Specifically, for 31 of the 113 RSAs tested,
26

--- Page 29 ---
$3.3 million of the $27.6 million due under the RSAs had not been collected.
Based on these results, we expanded the period of our review for four RSAs at
three State agencies that either had the majority of the uncollected
compensation or high variance between the expected and actual
compensation collected. Our expanded testing identified additional
compensation that had not been collected. In total for these three agencies,
we identified $6.0 million that was not received for the four RSAs.
Additionally, certain agencies did not verify the accuracy of compensation
totaling $800,300 for eight other RSAs.
We also noted that State agencies did not deposit compensation from 35
RSAs totaling $7.3 million into the MITDP Fund as required by law. Our test of
non-monetary compensation disclosed that the communications equipment
and services were received in accordance with the agreements.
Background
The State’s resource sharing law requires that monetary compensation from
RSAs be deposited into the MITDP Fund, a special fund to be used to support
the State’s major information technology development projects. The MITDP
Fund does not include resource sharing monetary compensation received by
MDOT agencies or by MPBC/MPT since these agencies are exempt by State
law. As shown in Table 5, of the 141 RSAs totaling $264.1 million, 51 RSAs
totaling $100.4 million were with agencies subject to the requirements of the
MITDP Fund and 90 agreements totaling $163.7 million were with MDOT and
MBPC/MPT which are exempt from the requirements of the MITDP Fund.

__________________________________________________________________
Findings
Finding 4
State agencies did not treat certain agreements as RSAs resulting in a lost
opportunity to maximize compensation. If these agreements had been
treated as RSAs, they would have been subject to DoIT’s review and valuation
process.
Analysis
State agencies did not treat certain agreements as RSAs even though these
agreements were consistent with the descriptions in law, resulting in the
failure to receive or maximize compensation. As noted in Finding 1, DoIT had
not established comprehensive policies and procedures for RSAs including
guidance to State agencies on the types of agreements that should be treated
as RSAs. As a result, our audit disclosed that 4 of 11 agencies reviewed
(three MDOT agencies -- SHA, MdTA, and MTA -- and DNR) had not created
RSAs for arrangements with private companies that qualified as RSAs as
28

--- Page 31 ---
described in the State’s resource sharing law. Specifically, we noted that
agencies were not consistent in their treatment of certain arrangements or did
not recognize certain arrangements as resource sharing opportunities. DoIT
management generally agreed with our assessment that these agreements
should have been treated as RSAs.
MDOT
 SHA did not create RSAs and receive any compensation from
telecommunication companies using certain State rights-of-way for the
installation of fiber optic cable and other communication equipment. SHA
allowed companies to install cable and equipment on rights-of-way along
both controlled access roads (roads with on/off ramps) and non-controlled
access roads. Although SHA created RSAs for work along controlled
access roads, it did not create RSAs for work along non-controlled access
roads. RSAs provide the State with long-term monetary or non-monetary
compensation for as long as the resource is being used by the company.
 According to SHA records, approximately 102 utility permits were issued by
SHA in calendar year 2016 for companies to install telecommunication
equipment on non-controlled access roads for which no compensation was
received. Rather than enter into RSAs, SHA
issued these utility permits for free. For example, Example of DAS
75 permits were issued to two companies to
install telecommunication equipment on utility
poles or streetlights for a distributed antenna
system (DAS). DAS, or small cell networks,
expand current cell network coverage and
increase network capacity within cities, indoors,
or at places where large groups of people
congregate (such as, stadiums, theme parks, or
universities). For comparison purposes, MSA has
an RSA for DAS at M&T Bank Stadium totaling
$1.4 million.
 MdTA and MTA may not have maximized compensation for certain
agreements with private companies that qualified under the State’s
resource sharing law. These agreements allowed private companies to
install telecommunication equipment on MdTA and MTA property (such as,
bridges, tunnels, train tracks, buildings, and land). MdTA processed 14
agreements (totaling $11.8 million) of its 15 agreements as license
agreements or utility permits and MTA processed 18 agreements (totaling
$676,000) of its 19 agreements as license agreements or utility permits.
Had these agreements been processed as RSAs, MDOT’s Office of the
29

--- Page 32 ---
Secretary and DoIT would have reviewed and valued these agreements
which could have resulted in higher compensation. The remaining two
agreements at MdTA and MTA were correctly processed as RSAs.
DNR
DNR did not create RSAs and assess fees for collocations that existed on
electric transmission towers located on DNR land. We identified four
collocations (three in Patapsco Valley State Park and one in Cunningham Falls
State Park) that had been in place for many years. Specifically, utility
companies with electric transmission towers on state land leased space on
these towers to information technology companies. Since the towers are
located on state land, the State should share in the compensation from the
leases. Although DNR was aware of these collocations, it had not established
RSAs with the utility companies to obtain a portion of the income. DNR had
created an RSA for a collocation arrangement in Green Ridge State Forest.
Additionally, in comparison, as noted in Finding 5, other State agencies (MdTA
and SHA) received monetary compensation for collocation arrangements.
After bringing this matter to the attention of DNR management, it initiated
action to establish an RSA for one of these collocations and to collect
retroactive compensation since the inception of the arrangement in 2003. As
of September 2017, DNR was still working with DoIT to establish the RSA and
it had estimated monetary compensation totaling $180,600 was due for the
period from 2003 to 2017. DNR had not taken any action on the remaining
three collocations and had not attempted to identify any additional
collocations on DNR land.
Recommendation 4
We recommend that State agencies
a. establish RSAs, including provisions for compensation, for all qualified
agreements in accordance with State law, including all necessary
approvals; and
b. identify all collocations and pursue the feasibility of obtaining retroactive
compensation as legally permissible, including those noted above.
30

--- Page 33 ---
Finding 5
Certain State agencies did not ensure that all monetary compensation was
received in accordance with the RSAs, resulting in the failure to collect
approximately $6.0 million.
Analysis
Certain State agencies did not always ensure that monetary compensation
was received for the use of State resources by private companies, as specified
in RSAs. We identified 113 RSAs at 10 State agencies that had provisions for
monetary compensation totaling $27.6 million during fiscal years 2015,
2016, and 2017. For each RSA, we compared the expected monetary
compensation, according to the RSA provisions, with the actual amounts
received during the aforementioned years. For 31 of the 113 RSAs tested,
$3.3 million of the $27.6 million due under the RSAs had not been collected.
Based on these results, we expanded the period of our review for four RSAs at
three State agencies that either had the majority of the uncollected
compensation or high variance between the expected and actual
compensation collected. Our expanded testing identified additional
compensation that had not been collected. In total, we identified monetary
compensation totaling approximately $6.0 million that these three State
agencies (SHA, DoIT, and MdTA) did not receive on four RSAs. Additionally,
three State agencies (MdTA, SHA, and DNR) did not verify the accuracy of
monetary compensation totaling $800,300 for eight other RSAs.
Agencies Did Not Ensure All RSA Compensation Was Received
SHA, DoIT, and MdTA did not collect monetary compensation totaling $6.0
million on four agreements.
 SHA did not adequately monitor compensation for a statewide fiber optic
RSA resulting in its failure to collect $3.5 million in compensation. The
RSA began in 1999 and allowed a telecommunication company to install
conduits and fiber optic cable throughout the State’s highway rights-of-
way. In return, the State obtained access to a portion of the fiber and was
estimated to earn monetary compensation totaling $49.8 million over the
40-year term. Our review disclosed that SHA did not verify the amounts
submitted by the company and, as a result, did not collect $3.5 million of
the $13 million due for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. In response to
our inquiries, SHA management advised us that the reduced
compensation was related to a 2010 modification to the RSA which
altered the payment terms. However, the modification was never signed
or approved, and MDOT’s legal counsel advised us that the modification
was not valid.
31

--- Page 34 ---
 DoIT did not monitor two of its RSAs, executed in 2001 and 2002, which
had lifetime monetary compensation totaling $6.1 million over the period
of the RSA. DoIT management was unaware of these RSAs even though
the signed agreements were maintained in DoIT’s files. As of June 2017,
we estimated that DoIT had not collected monetary compensation totaling
$2.6 million on these two RSAs for at least the most recent 12 years.
After bringing these agreements to DoIT’s attention, it collected $166,000
due for one agreement. As of November 2017, DoIT had not collected any
of the $2.4 million due on the other agreement.
 MdTA did not properly process a modification to an agreement which had
expired. Consequently, MdTA did not collect monetary compensation
totaling $34,600 for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. After bringing this issue
to MdTA’s attention, it took action to collect the past due compensation
owed.
Agencies Did Not Verify the Accuracy of Compensation Received
MdTA, SHA, and DNR did not obtain appropriate documentation needed to
verify the accuracy of certain compensation, totaling $800,300, which was
received on eight collocation RSAs during fiscal years 2015 through 2017.
For example, during fiscal year 2017, SHA collected $117,500 on four utility
collocation sites included in one RSA that allowed a telecommunication
company to install equipment on electric line transmission towers on SHA
rights-of-way. The compensation for these eight collocation RSAs included a
stated annual lease payment and additional compensation based on a stated
percentage (typically 25 to 35 percent) of any collocation revenue earned by
the utility company. However, none of these agencies obtained
documentation (such as, subleasing agreements) needed to verify the
accuracy of collocation revenue received.
As a result, there was a lack of assurance that the State obtained the proper
monetary compensation allowed by the RSA. We subsequently obtained
subleasing agreements for two of the aforementioned eight collocation RSAs
and confirmed the accuracy of payments received. We were unable to
confirm the accuracy of the payments received on the remaining six
collocation RSAs because the agreements lacked audit provisions.
Recommendation 5
We recommend that State agencies
a. monitor RSAs to ensure the proper amount of cash compensation is
collected;
32

--- Page 35 ---
b. immediately pursue collection of unpaid compensation, including the
identified amounts for the aforementioned agreements with SHA and DoIT;
and
c. obtain documentation to verify the accuracy of any collocation
compensation received.
Finding 6
DoIT did not monitor State agencies to ensure resource sharing monetary
compensation was deposited into the MITDP Fund, as required by State law.
As of April 2017, only $60,000 had been deposited into the MITDP Fund
since July 1, 2014. Our test disclosed five agencies improperly retained
compensation totaling $7.3 million during this period.
Analysis
Resource sharing monetary compensation was not deposited into the MITDP
Fund as required by State law. As noted in Table 5 on page 28, six State
agencies had 51 RSAs, with a lifetime monetary compensation of
approximately $89.3 million, for which the compensation was required to be
deposited into the MITDP Fund. Prior to our testing in April 2017, only
$60,000 had been deposited into the MITDP Fund related to one agreement,
since July 1, 2014. DoIT was not aware that monetary compensation from
RSA agreements was not being deposited into the MITDP fund since it did not
maintain a comprehensive record of approved RSAs and did not establish a
mechanism to ensure all compensation was received and deposited (as noted
in Finding 2).
For example, five agencies (BCCC, DNR, DoIT, MSA, and MSDE) improperly
retained monetary compensation totaling $7.3 million associated with 35
agreements during fiscal years 2015 through 2017 (through April 2017).
MSDE and MSA accounted for 21 of the 35 agreements totaling $6.3 million
($4.6 million for 2 MSDE agreements and $1.7 million for 19 MSA
agreements). Management personnel at these two agencies advised us that
they did not believe they were required to deposit the compensation from
their RSAs into the MITDP Fund, but could not provide us with the legal basis
for their position.
In response to our request, DoIT, MSDE, and MSA collectively obtained an
advice of the Office of the Attorney General on September 1, 2017, which
concluded that the MITDP Fund law did apply to MSDE and MSA. However,
the advice also stated that, for various reasons described below, the past and
future monetary compensation for these 21 RSAs did not have to be
deposited into the MITDP Fund.
33

--- Page 36 ---
 MSDE’s two agreements to lease excess educational broadcast channels
to private companies were submitted to DoIT for review. However, DoIT
failed to process the agreements as RSAs even though they met the
definition of an RSA. The Office of the Attorney General concluded that,
since DoIT failed to identify and approve these agreements as RSAs,
MSDE did not have to deposit the compensation related to these specific
agreements into the MITDP Fund. However, the Office of the Attorney
General also concluded that any future MSDE agreements should be
submitted to DoIT for review and approval and compensation should be
deposited into the MITDP Fund.
 MSA’s 19 agreements were pledged against a 2004 bond issuance. The
Office of the Attorney General concluded that, since the funds were
pledged, the revenue should not be deposited into the MITDP Fund until
the bonds were repaid in 2024. However, the Office of the Attorney
General also concluded that any future RSA compensation should be
deposited into the MITDP Fund and should not be pledged against future
bond offerings. Subsequent to our audit fieldwork, Chapter 150 of the
Laws of Maryland 2018 exempted the Maryland Stadium Authority from
DoIT’s authority or responsibility. Accordingly, effective July 1, 2018, MSA
is no longer required to deposit RSA revenue into the MITDP Fund.
Recommendation 6
We recommend that
a. DoIT establish a process to ensure that State agencies deposit all
applicable RSA compensation into the MITDP Fund as required, and
b. State agencies ensure all applicable compensation is deposited into the
MITDP Fund as required by State law and the aforementioned Attorney
General’s advice.
Objective 3 – Marketing
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to determine if the State is marketing resource sharing
opportunities to maximize revenues and to help achieve statewide
telecommunications infrastructure goals, such as expanding broadband to
citizens located in rural areas.
To accomplish this objective, we reviewed the efforts of DoIT and other State
agencies to market their property and telecommunication infrastructure
resources (such as, fiber optic and telecommunication towers) for potential

resource sharing opportunities. We also contacted Baltimore and
Montgomery counties and other states to identify their methods for marketing
resource sharing opportunities. Finally, we reviewed DoIT’s efforts to improve
the expansion of broadband service networks in rural and underserved areas
and its monitoring of RSAs with a nonprofit organization responsible for
providing broadband services in rural areas.
Conclusion
The State lacks a strategic plan for marketing resource sharing opportunities
to generate revenues and to help achieve statewide telecommunication
infrastructure goals. DoIT also could improve its monitoring of certain RSAs
with the one nonprofit organization responsible for providing broadband
networks in rural and underserved areas.
Background
State law provides that DoIT is responsible for developing an annual
Information Technology Master Plan to assess the State’s current information
technology needs. DoIT is also responsible for fostering telecommunication
and networking, and for improving information technology accessibility across
the State, especially in rural areas.
A Governor’s Executive Order, effective June 27, 2017, established the Office
of Rural Broadband within DoIT to help improve the access to high-speed
internet throughout the State. According to the Executive Order, the State has
a long-term vision to provide affordable high-speed internet service to every
Maryland home by the year 2022. In order to meet this goal, the Office is
responsible for identifying opportunities for productive partnerships, including
public-private partnerships that enable sharing of resources.
Over the years, the State has made a significant investment in
telecommunication infrastructure for the benefit of State and local
government operations, educational institutions, emergency first responders,
and Maryland citizens. For example, the State (1) implemented and expanded
its fiber optic network called networkMaryland; (2) constructed
telecommunication towers, and installed equipment for a wireless
communications network known as Maryland First for use by law enforcement
and other emergency first responders; and (3) implemented a comprehensive
traffic management and monitoring information system called the
Coordinated Highways Action Response Team (CHART) which is part of the
Maryland Intelligent Transportation System (ITS).
35

Solicitations for Resource Sharing Opportunities
The State has issued the following four solicitations to seek vendors to
develop potential resource sharing opportunities to benefit the State, its
citizens, and private telecommunication companies. According to our review,
27 agreements totaling $108.3 million were a direct result of these
solicitations.
 1994 - The State issued a solicitation on behalf of SHA for fiber optic cable
to be installed from the Pennsylvania state line through the Baltimore and
Washington corridor to link to CHART sites, as well as to fulfill other State
needs. This solicitation offered vendors access to install their fiber on
State highway rights-of-way. In exchange, the State received monetary
compensation and certain of this fiber.
 1995 - The State issued a solicitation offering to share resources (such as,
space on buildings, towers, and real estate) with vendors in exchange for
monetary compensation, equipment, or services. The State desired to
implement new wireless communications systems and improve existing
telecommunication systems (wireless, wired, and fiber optics) to establish
a comprehensive communications network.
 1996 - The State issued a solicitation for resource sharing in an effort to
install a high performance communications system and/or infrastructure
along State highway rights-of-way. Specifically, the State was seeking
services to support ITS or CHART, statewide data communications, voice
communications, video teleconferencing, and other broadband services in
exchange for use of State highway rights-of-way. The solicitation
envisioned the State would realize value by sharing in revenues from
vendor subleases of excess space on State infrastructure.
 2000 - The State issued a second solicitation for resource sharing
consistent with the aforementioned 1996 solicitation. Additionally, this
solicitation included receiving communication services for the State’s
networking project called networkMaryland. This solicitation expired in
2005.
Expansion of Broadband in Rural Areas
The State has routinely identified issues of inadequate broadband in rural
areas of the State, such as in Western, Southern, and Eastern Maryland. Over
the years, the State initiated efforts to expand broadband to these rural areas
including (1) providing financial assistance to private companies to plan,
construct, and maintain broadband communication services; and (2) installing
a network of fiber optic cable across the State known as the One Maryland
36

--- Page 39 ---
Broadband Network project to connect schools, libraries, hospitals, and public
safety agencies. These efforts allowed for the interconnection of other
independent networks to provide broadband service to citizens and to expand
networkMaryland.
According to a May 2013 report by the Federal Department of Transportation
called Successful Practices of Broadband Deployment in Highway Rights of
Way, due to the significant investment needed to build a broadband and
wireless infrastructure, telecommunication companies historically have
focused on expanding their networks in heavily populated areas to maximize
return on investment. To address this concern, Chapter 621, Laws of
Maryland 2017, established the Task Force on Rural Internet, Broadband,
Wireless, and Cellular Service, which comprises representatives from the
General Assembly, DoIT, the Department of Commerce, the Public Service
Commission, local government entities, and individuals from
telecommunication industries. The main objective of the Task Force is to
explore ways these representatives can work together to obtain federal
assistance for improving rural internet, broadband, wireless, and cellular
service, and to assess connectivity and coverage issues.
On January 9, 2018, the Task Force issued a report that offered various
recommendations to address accessibility to broadband in rural areas. These
recommendations included 1) to review and implement statutory and
regulatory changes to reduce obstacles and permitting challenges between
private providers and State government, and 2) to perform a complete
inventory of all State and local government agency assets including cellular
towers, water towers, and other structures for potential resource sharing
opportunities.
Findings
Finding 7
DoIT did not have a strategic plan for marketing resource sharing
opportunities to generate revenues and to help achieve statewide
telecommunication infrastructure goals.
Analysis
DoIT did not have a strategic plan for marketing resource sharing
opportunities to generate revenues and to help achieve statewide information
technology infrastructure goals. Consistent with its statewide responsibility to
foster telecommunication and networking, and to improve information
technology accessibility across the State, State law requires DoIT to ensure
37

--- Page 40 ---
that the State has a long-range vision for using information technology to
improve the overall effectiveness of State government and address the needs
of Maryland citizens.
 DoIT had not developed a strategic plan, within its Information Technology
Master Plan, for marketing the State’s available wireless and broadband
telecommunication resources (such as fiber optic cable and
telecommunication towers) for resource sharing. Consequently, the State
may not be maximizing opportunities to obtain revenue and to address the
wireless and broadband telecommunication infrastructure needs of the
State government or Maryland citizens in rural areas that lack access to
broadband.
 DoIT has not issued a solicitation for resource sharing since the 2000
solicitation expired in 2005. In addition, DoIT does not advertise its
interest in resource sharing opportunities on its website. In this regard,
both Baltimore and Montgomery counties maintain designated websites to
facilitate resource sharing opportunities. These websites included policies
and procedures for interested vendors to request and renew
telecommunication tower RSAs as well as searchable maps of tower
assets for resource sharing. These counties had no statistics available to
demonstrate the effectiveness of these marketing efforts.
Strategic marketing through direct public solicitations and website
advertisements could help ensure the State meets its information technology
infrastructure goals. Without these strategic marketing efforts, the State is
only responding to unsolicited resource sharing opportunities initiated by
private companies, potentially resulting in an underutilization of resource
sharing opportunities.
Recommendation 7
We recommend that the State
a. develop a strategic plan to market State assets for resource sharing
opportunities to generate revenues and to help achieve statewide
information technology infrastructure goals, and
b. strategically market resource sharing opportunities through direct
solicitations and on applicable State agency websites.

Finding 8
DoIT did not monitor RSAs with a nonprofit organization providing broadband
networks in rural and underserved areas and has not made any attempts
since 2013 to negotiate additional RSAs to further expand broadband in rural
areas.
Analysis
DoIT did not monitor existing RSAs with a nonprofit organization to ensure it
was providing broadband networks in rural and underserved areas, and had
not made any attempts since 2013 to negotiate additional RSAs to further
expand the broadband in other rural areas. To facilitate expansion of
broadband service in rural and underserved areas, State law allows nonprofit
telecommunication service providers to install broadband communication
infrastructure in State highway rights-of-way without charge.
 DoIT and MDOT have five active RSAs with a nonprofit organization,
established during the period from 2007 to 2013, granting the provider
access to State-owned fiber optic cable or allowing the provider to install
fiber optic cable in State rights-of-way to expand its own broadband
network. For example, in January 2013, DoIT entered into an RSA with the
nonprofit to grant access to State-owned fiber optic cable installed in 12
Maryland counties (Allegany, Anne Arundel, Calvert, Caroline, Cecil,
Charles, Garrett, St. Mary’s, Somerset, Washington, Wicomico, and
Worcester) in order to expand broadband network in rural and
underserved areas. Through its members, the provider partners with
private companies to provide broadband service to the citizens in those
areas.
According to this agreement, DoIT could obtain an annual report from the
nonprofit that identifies and certifies authorized users of the fiber optic
cable and could perform an audit of the nonprofit’s financial records. DoIT
did not effectively monitor the RSA to ensure the nonprofit service provider
was providing the expanded broadband. Specifically, DoIT did not obtain
the nonprofit’s annual reports nor perform an audit of the nonprofit’s
records, as permitted by the agreement, to ensure compliance with the
terms of the agreement. DoIT agreed that it should improve its monitoring
of the nonprofit since the nonprofit was not successful in expanding
broadband in Western Maryland as provided for in the RSA.
 DoIT also did not make any attempts since 2013 to negotiate additional
RSAs to further expand access to broadband in underserved rural areas.
Although private telecommunication towers and fiber optic cables exist
39

--- Page 42 ---
throughout the State’s rural areas, DoIT still has the opportunity to use its
resources to expand broadband with RSAs. For example, DoIT could have
attempted to negotiate RSAs to strategically build out wireless broadband
infrastructure on State-owned towers or property in rural areas.
As shown in Table 6, the majority of the State’s existing RSAs on towers
are in highly populated areas. Specifically, the State has RSAs on 18 of
the 50 towers in high-populated jurisdictions located in the Central region
of the State (Baltimore City, Baltimore, Carroll, Frederick, Harford, Howard,
and Montgomery Counties). The remaining jurisdictions in the Western,
Southern, and Eastern Shore regions have RSAs on only 9 of the
remaining 120 towers.

Recommendation 8
We recommend that DoIT
a. monitor existing RSAs with the aforementioned nonprofit organization to
ensure broadband networks are expanded in rural and underserved areas,
in accordance with the intent of the RSAs; and
b. increase the use of RSAs to strategically expand broadband in rural areas
consistent with need.

Objective 4 – Agreement Execution and Approval
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to determine if the State’s RSAs contain key provisions
designed to address significant risks and were properly executed,
documented, renewed, and approved in accordance with State law.
To accomplish this objective, we reviewed 10 RSAs primarily from Maryland
State agencies. We identified significant provisions that provided appropriate
safeguards to the State. Specifically, we identified the following seven
significant provisions which may not apply to all agreements.
1. Intended Use of Space – The RSA should specify the private company’s
authorized use of the space. Any restriction on subleasing or permitting
processes should be included. This provision prevents confusion and
ensures the State knows who and what is permitted on the State’s asset.
2. Agreement Start, End, and Renewal Periods – The RSA should include the
start and end dates and, if any renewals are permitted, should also specify
the number and years of these renewals. The RSA should clearly state if
the private company is permitted to remain on the asset after expiration of
the agreement.
3. Verification of Installed Telecommunication Equipment – The RSA should
include a provision that the private company’s equipment should be
installed as approved by the State and that the private company should
provide the related schematics to the State.
4. Interference of Company Equipment with State Equipment – The RSA
should include a requirement that private company equipment not
interfere with State public safety communications equipment and should
specify remedies to eliminate any interference, including removal of the
private company’s equipment.
5. Compensation Terms and Other Fees – The RSA should clearly state the
required compensation and type (monetary, in-kind, goods and services),
the timing of payment (monthly, quarterly, or annually), compensation
escalations for future years, and terms and penalties for failure to pay.
The RSA should include provisions for a security deposit and a right-to-
audit clause to allow the State to obtain supporting documentation or
review records for verification of compensation, as needed.
41

--- Page 44 ---
6. Liability and Insurance Protections – The RSA should include language
protecting the State from liability resulting from the private company’s use
of the property. Additionally, the private company should be required to
provide the State with a current insurance certification sufficient to
address any liabilities.
7. Access Rights and Restrictions to State Property – The RSA should define
how and when the private company is permitted to access the site.
Having identified significant safeguard provisions contained in RSAs, we
reviewed 25 RSAs, valued at $192.2 million, from multiple state agencies to
determine if the agreements contained these seven significant provisions
when applicable. We also determined if the 131 RSAs were reviewed, valued,
and approved by DoIT and were submitted to the Legislative Policy Committee
and Board of Public Works as necessary for review and approval as required
by State law. Finally, we reviewed the 8 RSAs (of the 25 RSAs initially selected
for review) that were in their renewal period to determine if the RSAs were
properly documented and approved.
Conclusion
RSAs did not always contain key provisions to address significant risks. For
example, 15 of the 25 RSAs reviewed did not contain all appropriate
compensation and fee provisions. Additionally, agencies did not always obtain
DoIT, Legislative Policy Committee, and Board of Public Works approvals as
required. Our review of certain RSAs disclosed that eight agencies did not
obtain proper review and approval for 79 RSAs, collectively valued at $50.3
million. We noted one agency employee unilaterally declined RSA proposals
valued at $442,500 without adequate justification.
Furthermore, agencies did not always take proper action or obtain proper
approvals when exercising renewal options and renegotiating expired RSAs.
Specifically, our test of eight RSAs valued at $52.3 million that were in their
renewal periods disclosed that State agencies had not obtained BPW approval
for five RSA renewals valued at $4.8 million on RSAs valued at $12.1 million.
Finally, we noted that certain companies were allowed to continue using State
resources beyond the stated RSA terms without a negotiation of
compensation terms.
42

Findings
Finding 9
RSAs did not always include adequate provisions to ensure that the State
received the appropriate compensation, was protected from liability, and had
approved the equipment installations on State resources.
Analysis
RSAs did not always include provisions to ensure that the State received the
appropriate compensation, was protected from liability, and had approved the
equipment installation on State resources. We reviewed 25 RSAs at multiple
State agencies (1 at BCCC, 2 at DNR, 2 at DoIT, 3 at MBPC/MPT, 3 at MSA, 2
at MSDE, 10 at SHA, 1 at MdTA, and 1 at MTA) to determine if the seven
significant provisions we identified were included when appropriate. Our
review disclosed that 7 RSAs adequately addressed these provisions; we
identified the following deficiencies with the other RSAs:
 15 RSAs did not adequately address certain compensation and fee
provisions. For example, 12 of these agreements did not include language
to address the State’s right to audit the records of the telecommunication
companies and requirements for a security deposit. The audit clause
allows the State to obtain and review supporting documents such as
sublease agreements when applicable (such as, collocation agreements
involving a base rent and a percentage of sublease revenue).
 12 RSAs did not include language protecting the State from liability
resulting from the private company’s negligence.
 5 RSAs did not adequately address the verification of installed
telecommunication equipment. Specifically, although all 25 RSAs
contained provisions requiring the installation of equipment in accordance
with approved plans, 5 agreements did not address one or more of the
following: inspection of installed equipment, relocation of equipment, or
permitting issues.
All 25 agreements contained adequate provisions to address the intended
use of the State resource, start and end dates of the RSAs, and terms of any
renewal periods; to prohibit interference with State equipment; and to define
the process for private company access to State property.
43

--- Page 46 ---
Recommendation 9
We recommend that each State agency
a. include the aforementioned significant provisions in all future RSAs, to the
extent applicable; and
b. modify its existing agreements to include the aforementioned significant
provisions to the extent allowed by law.
Finding 10
Eight State agencies did not obtain DoIT, Legislative Policy Committee, and
Board of Public Works approvals for 79 RSAs as required by law. In addition,
an employee at one State agency unilaterally declined RSA proposals valued
at $442,500 without adequate justification or obtaining DoIT input.
Analysis
State agencies did not always obtain the required DoIT, Legislative Policy
Committee (LPC), and Board of Public Works (BPW) approvals when executing
RSAs as required by law. In addition, an employee at one State agency
unilaterally declined RSA proposals valued at $442,500 without adequate
justification or obtaining DoIT input.
State law requires that agencies advise DoIT of all RSA proposals so DoIT can
determine the value of the proposal. DoIT can also determine if they have
economic merit, are advantageous to the individual agency, or will benefit the
State. Additionally, State law requires that DoIT submit agreements valued at,
or exceeding, $100,000 to LPC and agreements valued at, or exceeding,
$200,000 to BPW for approval.
RSAs Were Not Properly Reviewed and Approved
Our review of certain RSAs disclosed that eight agencies did not obtain proper
review and approval for 79 RSAs, collectively valued at $50.3 million, as
detailed in Table 7.
 Six agencies (MAA, MdTA, MTA, SHA, MBPC/MPT, and MSA) executed 53
RSAs totaling $33.5 million without obtaining any approvals from DoIT,
LPC, or BPW.
 Five agencies (MTA, SHA, MPBC/MPT, DNR, and DSP) executed 26 RSAs
totaling $16.8 million without involving DoIT and LPC. Instead, four of
these five agencies submitted the RSAs to the Department of General
Services (DGS) for review because the agreements involved land and
leases. DGS subsequently submitted them to BPW for review and
approval. Although DGS is required to be involved in the State’s land and
44

--- Page 47 ---
building leases, State law requires agencies to involve DoIT and LPC for
valuation, review, and approval of resource sharing agreements before
obtaining approval from BPW. The fifth agency, MTA, handled its RSAs
internally.
As noted in Finding 1, DoIT had not established comprehensive policies to
help agencies determine which agreements meet the legal definition of an
RSA, which likely contributed to this condition.

agreements which we deemed to be RSAs since they meet the legal requirements, but which the
agencies had not processed as RSAs and therefore had not pursued approval by DoIT, LPC, or BPW.
__________________________________________________________________
DoIT Was Not Advised of Certain Potential RSA Opportunities
A DNR employee unilaterally declined two RSA proposals valued at a total of
$442,500 without adequate justification. One proposal involved the
installation of fiber optic cable across State park land and the other involved
leasing space on a telecommunication tower. The private companies
submitted RSA proposals to DNR with provisions for monetary compensation.
However, the employee improperly notified the companies that DNR could no
longer accept monetary compensation but would accept compensation in the
form of equipment or services. However, the companies did not want to
45

--- Page 48 ---
provide equipment or services and terminated the negotiations. As a result,
the State missed the opportunity to obtain compensation totaling $442,500.
Monetary compensation would have had to be deposited into the MITDP fund
to be used at DoIT’s discretion while non-monetary compensation could have
been used directly for DNR’s purposes.
Recommendation 10
We recommend that State agencies
a. submit all RSAs for review, valuation, and applicable approvals in
accordance with State law; and, in consultation with DoIT and LPC,
determine the extent to which retroactive approval should be obtained for
the aforementioned RSAs; and
b. provide all proposed resource sharing opportunities received from private
companies to DoIT for its determination of the proposal’s economic merit
or benefits to the State.
Finding 11
State agencies did not always document and obtain the required approvals
when exercising renewal options on RSAs. In addition, private companies
were allowed to continue using State resources after the RSAs expired without
a negotiation of compensation terms.
Analysis
State agencies did not always document and obtain the required approvals
when exercising renewal options on RSAs. In addition, telecommunication
companies were allowed to continue using State resources after the RSAs
expired. Consequently, the State agencies missed opportunities to negotiate
the payment terms of the RSAs.
Renewal Options
State agencies did not always ensure that RSAs were renewed in accordance
with State law and the terms stated in the agreements. Of the 25 RSAs
initially selected for testing, 8 RSAs were in their renewal periods. We tested
these 8 RSAs which were valued at $52.3 million. These RSAs were from the
following agencies: MSA, MPBC/MPT, MTA, MdTA, SHA, DoIT, DNR, and BCCC.
Our test disclosed that five State agencies (MdTA, SHA, DoIT, DNR, and BCCC)
had not obtained BPW approval for RSA renewals valued at $4.8 million, as
required by State law. In addition, two of these RSAs, with renewals valued at
$2 million, lacked documentation of the execution of the renewal options, as
required by the RSAs. Instead, the State agencies informally exercised most
of the renewal options thereby allowing the telecommunication companies to
continue to use State property and pay compensation specified in the RSA.
46

--- Page 49 ---
RSAs generally require formal acceptance by the State and the company to
exercise renewal options. Additionally, State law as clarified by BPW
management requires that the execution of renewal options valued at
$200,000 or greater be approved by BPW unless the State agency clearly
presented the renewal options to BPW when the RSA was originally approved.
Continued Use of Expired Agreements
We identified RSAs that had exhausted all renewal options to determine if
State agencies were allowing telecommunication companies to continue using
State resources. Specifically, 10 RSAs with BCCC, DNR, DSP, SHA, MdTA, and
MTA, valued at $6 million, were allowed to continue at the same rate, after
the expiration of the original term and all renewal options, without any formal
agreement and renegotiation of terms. As of June 30, 2017, these RSAs had
been expired for periods generally ranging from two months to four years with
one RSA having been expired for nine years.
Since the RSAs had not been renegotiated, payments were generally
maintained at rates established during the final renewal period of each RSA
which could be below current market values. For example, BCCC had 2
expired RSAs for which the telecommunication companies were currently
paying rates established in 2008. In this regard, DoIT maintains suggested
rates for telecommunication towers. Had the RSAs been renegotiated using
the DoIT rates, BCCC would have earned $121,600 (or 15 percent) more than
the 816,700 paid by the telecommunication companies since the expiration
of the RSAs.
Recommendation 11
We recommend that State agencies
a. review existing RSAs to identify any expired agreements;
b. execute new RSAs, using current DoIT-approved rates, as each RSA
expires, and for the aforementioned 10 expired RSAs; and
c. ensure that renewals valued at $200,000 or more are submitted to BPW
for approval unless the State agency clearly presented the renewal option
when the RSA was originally approved, including the RSAs noted above.
Objective 5 – Tracking and Monitoring Equipment
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to determine if State agencies are maintaining records of
private equipment on State-owned telecommunication towers. To accomplish
our objective we reviewed the tower equipment inventory processes at five
47

--- Page 50 ---
State agencies (MBPC/MPT, SHA, MIEMSS, DSP, and DNR) that were
responsible for 159 of the State’s 170 telecommunication towers.
Conclusion
We determined that State agencies did not always maintain inventories of
private telecommunication equipment on towers.
Finding
Finding 12
State agencies did not always maintain inventories of private
telecommunication equipment on towers.
Analysis
We reviewed the tower equipment inventory processes at five State agencies
(MBPC/MPT, SHA, MIEMSS, DSP, and DNR) responsible for 159 of the 170
telecommunication towers in the State. Our review disclosed that four of
these agencies did not maintain comprehensive inventories of
telecommunication equipment on the towers. MPBC/MPT maintained a
complete and accurate inventory of equipment attached to its seven
telecommunication towers. MBPC/MPT maintained this inventory since its
telecommunication towers are instrumental to its core mission of public
broadcasting and it is allowed to retain RSA compensation. The remaining
four State agencies that had 152 towers, however, did not maintain inventory
records, only had records of their own equipment on the tower, or did not
ensure the records were maintained on a current basis.
Based on the significance of the financial investment made by the State to
construct telecommunication towers (during fiscal years 2000 through 2017,
there were 77 State-owned telecommunication towers constructed at a cost
of approximately $35.5 million), we believe that all attached equipment
should be inventoried to help ensure that only appropriate communications
equipment is deployed on State towers. Additionally, maintaining the integrity
of the State’s wireless communication is important since a majority of the
State’s telecommunication towers support critical public safety
communication networks.
State-owned towers can have telecommunication equipment attached from
multiple governmental entities (such as, State, federal, and local) as well as
private companies through resource sharing. Maintaining inventory records of
this equipment is necessary to ensure the State is aware of the type of
48

--- Page 51 ---
equipment on its towers and the entity responsible for the equipment, to
ensure no unauthorized equipment has been attached to the towers, and to
identify abandoned or obsolete equipment.
These inventories could be accomplished periodically during tower inspections
or through observation of the equipment installed on the tower and the
related equipment within the telecommunication shelter at the base of the
tower. The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) recommends that
telecommunication towers be inspected on a routine basis (generally every
three to five years depending on the type of tower) and after severe wind/ice
storms or other extreme loading conditions. TIA also recommends
considering shorter inspection intervals for towers located in coastal salt
water environment, in corrosive atmospheres, and in areas subject to
frequent vandalism.
Recommendation 12
We recommend that State agencies maintain inventories of all private
telecommunication equipment (such as, type, owner, and location) attached
to State-owned towers.

Source: Compiled and calculated by OLA using various agreement documents, BPW agendas, and other supporting
documents.
^ These 10 agreements (2 at BCCC, 2 at DNR, 1 at DSP, 1 at SHA, 2 at MdTA, and 2 at MTA), valued at $6
million, were allowed to continue at the same rate, after the expiration of the original term and all renewal
options without any formal agreement. Since they were allowed to continue, the value of the agreements
is included in the Active RSA value.
*These 15 agreements (3 at DNR, 8 at SHA, 1 at MdTA, 1 at MBPC/MPT, and 2 at MSA), valued at $5.9
million, had expired or were terminated and were not allowed to continue as of June 30, 2017. Therefore,
as of June 30, 2017, 126 agreements totaling $258.1 million were active and 15 agreements totaling
$5.94 million were inactive.
Note: Certain totals may not add up due to rounding.

4 Although MDOT-SHA is responsible for the antenna structure on top of the World Trade Center building, the Maryland Port Administration (MPA) has two resource sharing agreements with
private companies for equipment on the antenna structure. Since DoIT does not have oversight of MPA, MPA and their resource sharing agreements were excluded from the scope of our
audit. Therefore, MPA’s two resource sharing agreements on the World Trade Center Building are not included in the 141 resource sharing agreements detailed in Exhibit 2.

Lieutenant Governor
MICHAEL G. LEAHY
State of Maryland Secretary
LANCE SCHINE
Department of Information Technology Deputy Secretary
August 2, 2018
Mr. Thomas J. Barnickel III, CPA
Legislative Auditor
State of Maryland
Office of Legislative Audits
301 West Preston Street, Room 1202
Baltimore, MD 21201
Dear Mr. Barnickel:
The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) has reviewed your performance audit report on
the Telecommunications Resource Sharing Agreements. As requested, our responses to the
Findings in the report, as related to DoIT, are attached.
DoIT appreciates the insight into the management and functioning of, and possible improvements
to, Resource Sharing under 3A‐307(c) of the State Finance and Procurement Article. However, the
first subparagraph of 3A‐307(c) states, in pertinent part, “a unit of state government shall advise
the Secretary of any information technology proposal involving resource sharing…”. Clearly, this
provision creates a duty on the part of units of state government to inform the Secretary of their
intent before the Secretary can act on such actions. Failure to inform the Secretary is violative of
clear statutory directions, and one should acknowledge that it is impossible for one to act on
something they do not know that they do not know. DoIT acknowledges that there should have
been internal questions raised about the nature of the resource sharing program as there was, in
certain limited cases, insufficient evidence that units of state government were utilizing the process
as defined in statute. DoIT reminds the auditors that the Secretary does not believe DoIT possesses
the legal authority to sanction units of government for misconduct. DoIT would support legislative
action to clarify its authority in these matters.
Progress is being made under the current administration and DoIT agrees that more can be done to
manage and improve the State’s tower and RSA inventory, improve record keeping, and provide
guidance to other agencies. The following are some of DoIT’s planned enhancements:
 Create a centralized asset management database and RSA contract management;
 Provide other State agencies the opportunity to upload their asset inventories and contracts
to that database at no charge;
 Document and post additional guidance, instructions, and policies;
 Monitor unexpected deviations in deposits into the MITDP fund; and,
 Improve our processes and procedures for monitoring our RSA agreements.

page 2
DoIT respectfully disagrees with the premise of certain findings and recommendations in the
discussion notes. As stated above, DoIT believes that the analysis and recommendations issued by
the audit team overstate DoIT’s level of authority in regards to RSA oversight. For example, DoIT is
not empowered by State law to:
 Conduct discovery of assets owned and controlled by other agencies
 Review the financial records of other state agencies under the guise of “monitoring”
 Enforce other agencies to comply with State law
State resources include all real and personal property owned by the state. These assets become
subject to resource sharing agreements when a unit of state government contracts with a third
party to allow that third party to use state property. Beyond the statutory issues mentioned above,
for DoIT to undertake internal financial audits of other units of government to identify resource
sharing agreements is clearly beyond DoIT’s resources, capability, and authority. Each agency is,
and always has been, responsible for its own contracts, assets, agreements, conduct of their
employees, and compliance with the law.
DoIT respectfully disagrees with the auditor’s statement:
“… the lack of comprehensive RSA policies resulted in subjective interpretations of the
applicability and use of the State’s resource sharing law and contributed to the following
deficiencies we identified at DoIT and State agencies.”
Numerous audit findings are longstanding issues that have been present through multiple
administrations. DoIT is working with state agencies to mitigate the deficiencies identified in the
RSA program.
Notwithstanding the above objections, DoIT appreciates OLA’s review of the RSA program as it
clearly demonstrates to the applicable state agencies their responsibility to comply with the RSA
law. The audit also underscores the value that OLA auditors provide to the people of Maryland. We
commend the OLA audit team for their diligence and professionalism. DoIT is committed, within the
constraints of its authority and budget, to improve the Resource Sharing program as described
here.
If you have any questions or need additional information, you may contact Norman Farley at (410)
697‐9681 or norman.farley@maryland.gov.

Finding 1
DoIT had not established comprehensive policies to guide State agencies on
the proper execution, control, and monitoring of RSAs.
Recommendation 1
We recommend DoIT establish comprehensive policies to guide State
agencies in the proper execution, control, and monitoring of RSAs that
incorporate, at a minimum, the elements noted above.
DoIT Response: Partially Agree
1. DoIT Agrees to improve upon the published policies and provide
additional guidance to State agencies. However, DoIT can only provide
guidance since DoIT has no authority, visibility, staff or mechanism to
review legal agreements made by other state agencies. This
responsibility remains, as always, with the individual agencies.
2. DoIT Disagrees with the opinion of the auditors that the findings 4, 5, 6
and 10 would have been avoided by additional documentation
restating existing State law. Individual agencies are accountable for
the contracts they enter into as well as following State law.
3. DoIT Disagrees with the opinion of the auditors that finding 11 would
have been avoided by DoIT restating existing State procurement law.
Individual agencies are accountable for following procurement law.
Auditor’s Comment: Although DoIT agreed to improve and
provide additional guidance, it disagreed that the absence of
such guidance contributed to various audit findings. This
assertion is unsupported and is contrary to the findings in this
report and the agencies’ feedback we received both during the
audit and in response to the audit recommendations.
Finding 2
DoIT and most State agencies did not maintain comprehensive records of
RSAs.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that
a. DoIT and the applicable State agencies maintain a comprehensive list of
all RSAs for which they are responsible, and copies of the related
agreements; and
b. DoIT direct agencies to periodically (such as, annually) report the status of
all active RSAs.

--- Page 76 ---
DoIT Response:
a. Agree
b. Agree - DoIT will periodically send out requests for State Agencies to
update their RSA information to a central repository. Responsibility for
reporting RSA agreements and inventories lies with the individual
agencies that own them.
Finding 3
DoIT and certain State agencies lacked comprehensive inventories of State-
owned telecommunication towers and fiber optic cables for potential resource
sharing.
Recommendation 3
We recommend DoIT and the State agencies
a. develop and maintain comprehensive inventory databases of State-owned
telecommunication towers and fiber optic cables; and
b. use the inventory databases to plan for resource sharing opportunities
(such as, space on telecommunication towers available for lease and
unused fiber optic cable) and to achieve statewide telecommunications
infrastructure goals.
DoIT’s Response:
a. Partially Agree
1. DoIT Disagrees with the statement in the above analysis that DoIT’s
network fiber isn’t well inventoried. networkMaryland fiber is
extremely well documented and DoIT offered to show it to the
auditors multiple times.
2. DoIT Agrees to create an asset inventory database and maintain a
comprehensive inventory of tower assets it owns and controls.
3. DoIT Agrees to open the database to other state agencies and
invite them to add their info as well.
4. DoIT Disagrees with the opinion of the auditors that DoIT is to be
held accountable for inventory of assets it does not own or control.
Responsibility for reporting RSA agreements and inventories lies
with the individual agencies that own them.
b. Partially Agree – DoIT agrees to the extent of the resources it owns and
controls as well as the information provided by the agencies uploaded
to the aforementioned inventory database. Responsibility for reporting
RSA agreements and inventories lay with the individual agencies that
own them.

--- Page 77 ---
Auditor’s Comment: The finding relates to the lack of
comprehensive records for towers and fiber optic cable under
the control of various agencies, including DoIT. Accordingly, to
help identify revenue generation and service enhancement
opportunities, as well as to avoid duplication for future
installations, we recommended that a comprehensive database
be maintained for the State. DoIT has agreed to establish a
centralized inventory record of cell towers. Contrary to its
assertion, we did not state that DoIT should be held
accountable for the inventory of other State agency assets it
does not own or control.
Regarding the fiber cable, we were aware of DoIT’s inventory
records for networkMaryland. The focus of this aspect of our
finding is that DoIT and MDOT did not coordinate with each
other to ensure the State maintained an accurate and
comprehensive database of State-owned fiber. In addition,
DoIT’s inventory records for networkMaryland were not
comprehensive because the records did not indicate the portion
of fiber that was unused.
Finding 5
Certain State agencies did not ensure that all monetary compensation was
received in accordance with the RSAs, resulting in the failure to collect
approximately $6.0 million.
Recommendation 5
We recommend that State agencies
a. monitor RSAs to ensure the proper amount of cash compensation is
collected;
b. immediately pursue collection of unpaid compensation, including the
identified amounts for the aforementioned agreements with SHA and DoIT;
and
c. obtain documentation to verify the accuracy of any collocation
compensation received.
DoIT’s Response
a. Agree
b. Agree
c. Agree

--- Page 78 ---
Finding 6
DoIT did not monitor State agencies to ensure resource sharing monetary
compensation was deposited into the MITDP Fund, as required by State law.
As of April 2017, only $60,000 had been deposited into the MITDP Fund
since July 1, 2014. Our test disclosed five agencies improperly retained
compensation totaling $7.3 million during this period.
Recommendation 6
We recommend that
a. DoIT establish a process to ensure that State agencies deposit all
applicable RSA compensation into the MITDP Fund as required, and
b. State agencies ensure all applicable compensation is deposited into the
MITDP Fund as required by State law and the aforementioned Attorney
General’s advice.
DoIT’s Response
a. Disagree – This is auditing function and DoIT has no mechnism or
authority to ensure agencies are accurately or completely depositing all
allicable RSA copensation. However, we can monitor notable changes
or descrepencies and inquire with the pertenant agencies as to the
nature of the change. Individual agencies are ultimately accountable
for accurate and timely transfer of funds into the MITDP fund.
b. Agree
Auditor’s Comment: Since the MITDP Fund administered by
DoIT is the beneficiary of certain RSA compensation, DoIT
should be interested in establishing a process to ensure such
compensation associated with RSAs it approved are forwarded
to the Fund. The use of a centralized RSA database, which
seems to be alluded to in DoIT’s response, could provide a
mechanism to help ensure the required compensation is
deposited.
Finding 7
DoIT did not have a strategic plan for marketing resource sharing
opportunities to generate revenues and to help achieve statewide
telecommunication infrastructure goals.
Recommendation 7
We recommend that the State
a. develop a strategic plan to market State assets for resource sharing
opportunities to generate revenues and to help achieve statewide
information technology infrastructure goals, and

--- Page 79 ---
b. strategically market resource sharing opportunities through direct
solicitations and on applicable State agency websites.
DoIT Response
a. Agree - DoIT agrees with the marketing of state assets however
“generating revenue” will only be emphasized to the extent to which it
will not conflict with nor detract from rural broadband goals, state tech
goals and non-monetary reciprocal agreements.
b. Agree – This will be under the responsibility of the Office of Rural
Broadband.
Finding 8
DoIT did not monitor RSAs with a nonprofit organization providing broadband
networks in rural and underserved areas and has not made any attempts
since 2013 to negotiate additional RSAs to further expand broadband in rural
areas.
Recommendation 8
We recommend that DoIT
a. monitor existing RSAs with the aforementioned nonprofit organization to
ensure broadband networks are expanded in rural and underserved areas,
in accordance with the intent of the RSAs; and
b. increase the use of RSAs to strategically expand broadband in rural areas
consistent with need.
DoIT Response: Disagree
The finding and recommendation as written strongly imply that DoIT has taken
no action to expand rural broadband access which is not the case.
Additionally, it assumes and asserts that this is the only method available to
expand broadband access to underserved, rural areas. This is also not the
case. DoIT has taken multiple actions to expand rural broadband:
 DoIT engaged in discussions to negotiate additional resources to address
insufficiencies along the I-68/I-70 corridor. DoIT participated in calls with
representatives of a nonprofit organization on Dec. 18, 2017 and on Jan.
25, 2018.
 Conference calls were held in December and January, as per the image
above, while concepts for a proposed expansion along the I-68 corridor
were discussed with DoIT, Maryland Department of Commerce, and The
Tri-County Council of Western Maryland as early as July, 2017.
 DoIT met with the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
on Wednesday, July 12, 2017, to discuss ways that Maryland could more
easily expand resource sharing agreements in rural communities.

--- Page 80 ---
 On Friday, June 23, 2017 DoiT met with officials of Garrett County,
Maryland. Arising out of that discussion, DoIT agreed to provide access to
an MPT aerial tower at Eagle Rock. This agreement to provide access was
publicized, http://governor.maryland.gov/2017/10/12/governor-larry-
hogan-announces-successful-rural-broadband-launch-in-garrett-county/
 On October 13, 2017, Governor Hogan held a press conference to
announce a significant project in Western Maryland that will "bring high-
speed broadband connectivity to eight business parks in Western
Maryland and to downtown Cumberland to support critical redevelopment
projects. The project enhances 66 new miles of lit fiber, creating a network
of more than 3,600 miles of fiber."
http://governor.maryland.gov/2017/10/13/governor-larry-hogan-
highlights-economic-development-job-creation-initiatives-in-western-
maryland/
Auditor’s Comment: Our finding only relates to DoIT’s oversight of an
existing arrangement with a nonprofit organization and its efforts to
use the RSA process to expand broadband access in underserved
areas. Additional efforts, including certain of those highlighted in
DoIT’s response, are addressed in this report in the Background
Information section of the report as well as the Background for
Objective 3.
Finding 9
RSAs did not always include adequate provisions to ensure that the State
received the appropriate compensation, was protected from liability, and had
approved the equipment installations on State resources.
Recommendation 9
We recommend that each State agency
a. include the aforementioned significant provisions in all future RSAs, to the
extent applicable; and
b. modify its existing agreements to include the aforementioned significant
provisions to the extent allowed by law.
DoIT Response
a. Agree
b. Agree

--- Page 81 ---
Finding 11
State agencies did not always document and obtain the required approvals
when exercising renewal options on RSAs. In addition, private companies
were allowed to continue using State resources after the RSAs expired without
a negotiation of compensation terms.
Recommendation 11
We recommend that State agencies
a. review existing RSAs to identify any expired agreements;
b. execute new RSAs, using current DoIT-approved rates, as each RSA
expires, and for the aforementioned 10 expired RSAs; and
c. ensure that renewals valued at $200,000 or more are submitted to BPW
for approval unless the State agency clearly presented the renewal option
when the RSA was originally approved, including the RSAs noted above.
DoIT Response
A: Agree
B: Agree
C: Agree
Finding 12
State agencies did not always maintain inventories of private
telecommunication equipment on towers.
Recommendation 12
We recommend that State agencies maintain inventories of all private
telecommunication equipment (such as, type, owner, and location) attached
to State-owned towers.
DoIT Response: Agree Subject to availability of funding to conduct the
inventories.

--- Page 90 ---
Finding 6
DoIT did not monitor State agencies to ensure resource sharing monetary compensation
was deposited into the MITDP Fund, as required by State law. As of April 2017, only
$60,000 had been deposited into the MITDP Fund since July 1, 2014. Our test disclosed
five agencies improperly retained compensation totaling $7.3 million during this period.
Recommendation 6
We recommend that
a. DoIT establish a process to ensure that State agencies deposit all applicable RSA
compensation into the MITDP Fund as required, and
b. State agencies ensure all applicable compensation is deposited into the MITDP Fund as
required by State law and the aforementioned Attorney General’s advice.
MSDE Response:
Regarding Recommendation a, the Agency will comply with any process developed and
communicated to the Agency by DoIT regarding depositing all applicable RSA compensation into
the Major Information Technology Development Program (MITDP) Fund.
Regarding Recommendation b, the Agency will comply with the referenced September 1, 2017
advice obtained from the Office of the Attorney General.
Finding 9
RSAs did not always include adequate provisions to ensure that the State received the
appropriate compensation, was protected from liability, and had approved the equipment
installations on State resources.
Recommendation 9
We recommend that each State agency
a. include the aforementioned significant provisions in all future RSAs, to the extent
applicable; and
b. modify its existing agreements to include the aforementioned significant provisions to the
extent allowed by law.
MSDE Response:
Combined response to Recommendations a and b--- One of MSDE’s Resource Sharing
Agreements (RSA) (contract entered into on July 1, 2009) was cited to be deficient regarding three
subcomponents (Late Fees, Security Deposit and Right to Audit) of the ‘Compensation Terms and
Other Fees’ significant provision. The second RSA contract entered into April 18, 2007 was also
cited for the three prior referenced subcomponents and an additional subcomponent (Where
Payable) of the ‘Compensation Terms and Other Fees’ significant provision. Finally, both RSAs
were cited for the ‘Governmental Immunity’ subcomponent of the ‘Liability and Insurance

--- Page 91 ---
Protections’ significant provision. Following are MSDE’s responses for each of the
subcomponents of the two cited significant provisions.
Late fees----If there was an issue of late payment MSDE could always choose to file a claim against
the contractor for late payments under COMAR 21.10.04.05 or threaten contract action (e.g.,
termination) in the event that the contractor does not comply with sending payments in accordance
with the contract terms. Consequently, the Agency does not believe that an additional contract
provision regarding this issue is necessary in its current or any future RSA contracts.
Security Deposit--- Due to the intangible nature of the services provided under MSDE’s two RSAs,
a security deposit would not apply as they are related to leasing excess capacity on channels
licensed to MSDE by the Federal Communications Commission. Consequently, the Agency does
not believe that the current contracts need to be amended for this significant provision. However,
if a future RSA involved items which are tangible in nature, such as a tower, then inclusion of this
significant provision in the related contract may be appropriate.
Landlord’s Right to Audit and Review Tenant’s Books and Records and Governmental Immunity
--- Pursuant to COMAR 21.06.05.02B procurement agencies, the Department of Legislative
Services or any other State unit authorized by law is entitled to audit the books and records related
to the performance of a contractor. Consequently, MSDE is authorized to conduct audits of the
lessee even though the provision is not expressly included in the agreements. It is important to
recognize that Maryland laws that apply at the time the contract is made are incorporated into the
contract “as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms; and this rule embraces
alike those which affect its validity, construction, discharge and enforcement.” Denice v.
Spotswood I. Quinby, Inc., 248 Md. 428, 437 (1968). The parties have notice of this provision in
paragraph 27 of the 2007 agreement and paragraph 26 pf the 2009 agreement which states
“Maryland Law prevails”. However, MSDE will amend both existing RSAs to reflect a specific
provision for this issue. Also, any future RSA will include a specific provision for this issue.
Governmental Immunity---The defense of government immunity is barred by State Govt. Art §12-
201 because the State waives governmental immunity when it enters into contracts. Consequently,
the Agency does not believe that an additional contract provision regarding this issue is necessary
in its current or any future RSA contracts.
Where Payable---OLA determined that this provision was adequately addressed in the RSA
contract entered into on July 1, 2009. Attachment A of this contract contained satisfactory
information regarding where remittances are to be made. The second RSA contract, entered into
on April 18, 2007, will be amended to include an Attachment A. Similarly, all future RSA
contracts will include an Attachment A.

Finding #2
DoIT and most State agencies did not maintain comprehensive records of
RSAs.
Recommendation:
We recommend that
a. DoIT and the applicable State agencies maintain a comprehensive list of all
RSAs for which they are responsible, and copies of the related agreements;
and
b. DoIT direct agencies to periodically (such as, annually) report the status of
all active RSAs.
MSA concurs with the finding and recommendations.
MSA has created a comprehensive listing of the existing agreements and will continue to
update it as new agreements or amendments are entered into. MSA also plans to utilize
software that will assist with the billing of its resource sharing agreements.
MSA will submit a list of agreements to DoIT as of June 30, 2018.
Objective 2 - Compenstaion
Finding #6
DoIT did not monitor State agencies to ensure resource sharing monetary
compensation was deposited into the MITDP Fund, as required by State
law. As of April 2017, only $60,000 had been deposited into the MITDP
Fund since July 1, 2014. Our test disclosed five agencies improperly
retained compensation totaling $7.3 million during the period.
We recommend that
a. DoIT establish a process to ensure that State agencies deposit all
applicable RSA compensation into the MITDP Fund as required, and
b. State agencies ensure all applicable compensation is deposited into the
MITDP Fund as required by State law and the aforementioned Attorney
General’s advice.
MSA concurs with the finding and recommendations.
In accordance with the Attorney General’s advice and Chapter 150 of the Laws of
Maryland 2018, MSA is not required to deposit any past or future resource sharing
revenue into the MITDP Fund.

Objective 4 – Agreement Execution and Approval
Finding #9
RSAs did not always include adequate provisions to ensure that the State
received the appropriate compensation, was protected from liability, and
had approved the equipment installations on State resources.
We recommend that each State agency
a. Include the aforementioned significant provisions in all future RSAs, to
the extent applicable; and
b. Modify its existing agreements to include the aforementioned significant
provisions to the extent allowed by law.
MSA concurs with the finding and recommendations.
MSA will review the standard template used for each new agreement and make sure the
seven significant provisions are incorporated. Also, MSA will perform a complete review
of existing agreements for any missing provisions and work towards completing
amendments for any agreements that are missing any of the seven provisions.
Finding #10
Eight State agencies did not obtain DoIT, Legislative Policy Committee, and
Board of Public Works approvals for 81 RSAs as required by law. In
addition, an employee at one State agency unilaterally declined RSA
proposal valued at $442,500 without adequate justification or obtaining
DoIT input.
We recommend that State agencies
a. submit all RSAs for review, valuation, and applicable approvals in
accordance with State law; and, in consultation with DoIT and LPC,
determine the extent to which retroactive approval should be obtained for
the aforementioned RSAs; and
b. provide all proposed resource sharing opportunities received from private
companies to DoIT for its determination for the proposal’s economic merit
or benefits to the State.
MSA disagrees with the audit recommendation that seeking retroactive approval for
existing agreements is appropriate. A request for approval suggests there is an option to
disapprove. There is not. These are binding contracts entered into in good faith by MSA
and the other parties. Moreover, as an independent unit in the Executive Branch of the
State government with its own governing board, MSA was never required to take any of
the agreements to LPC or BPW for approval pursuant to Division II of the State
procurement law.
In addition, MSA has identified the inconsistency between MSA’s general exemption from
Division II of the State procurement law and the requirements of SFP § 3A-307(c)(3),
Page 3 of 4 Maryland Stadium Authority

which appear to grant the Secretary of DoIT the authority to determine that certain
resource sharing agreements be treated as procurement contracts under Division II of the
procurement law.
Although MSA disagrees with the audit recommendation, MSA will provide copies of its
existing agreements to DoIT for review. MSA will work directly with DoIT on any further
requirements that exist under applicable law.

Re: Statewide Audit of Resource Sharing Agreements (RSA)
Dear Mr. Barnickel:
Enclosed please find the Baltimore City Community College
response to Statewide Audit of Resource Sharing Agreements. The
College has responded, as requested, only to specific findings
involving the College. Our response to each issue follows:
Finding 9
RSAs did not always include adequate provisions to ensure that the
State received the appropriate compensation, was protected from
liability, and had approved the equipment installations on State
resources:
BCCC will work with DoIT (as the State-determined oversight
agency for the College on such matters) to include the
aforementioned provisions in future RSAs. The College will also
work with DoIT to modify existing agreements, to the extent
possible given their active-executed status, to include the
aforementioned provisions.

--- Page 105 ---
Page 2
Finding 11
State agencies did not always document and obtain the required approvals when exercising
renewal options on RSAs. In addition, private companies were allowed to continue using
State resources after the RSAs expired without a negotiation of compensation terms:
BCCC will work with DGS and DoIT (as the State-determined oversight agency for the
College on such matters) to review existing RSAs to identify any expired agreements. Any
expired agreements are in a hold-over status, with the College intending to renew such
leases. The College will also work with DoIT to execute new RSAs, using current DoIT-
approved rates, as each RSA expires, and will continue to work with DoIT to ensure that
renewals valued at $200,000 or more are submitted to BPW for approval.
Thank you for the opportunity to respond.
Sincerely,
Gordon F. May, PhD
President and CEO
