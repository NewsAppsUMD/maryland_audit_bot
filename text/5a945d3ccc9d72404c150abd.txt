Dear Senator Kasemeyer and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office ofLegislative Audits (OLA) has conducted a review ofthe actions takenby the
Department of Human Resources (DHR) Family Investment Administration (FIA) to resolve the
four repeat findings in our April 9, 2015 audit report. This review was conducted in accordance
with a requirement specified in the April 2016 Joint Chairmen’sReport (JCR), page 87. The JCR
required that, prior to the release of $100,000 of its administrative appropriation for fiscal year
2017, FIA must take corrective action on all repeat audit findings. The JCR language further
provided that OLA submit areportto the budget committees listing each repeat audit finding along
with a determination that each finding was corrected. The OLA report is required to be submitted
to allow 45 days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior to the end ofthe
fiscal year.
The April 9, 2015 audit report of FIA contained four repeat audit findings (findings 1, 3,
4, and 5) that were addressed by four recommendations (recommendations 1c, 3a, 4a, and 5b). In
accordance with the April 2016 ICRrequirement, FIA provided a report to OLA, datedNovember
1, 2016, detailing the corrective actions that it had taken with respect to the repeat audit findings.
We reviewed this report and related documentation, performed limited tests and analyses ofthe
information, and held discussion with FIA personnel as necessary to assess the implementation
status of the related recommendations. Our review did not constitute an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Delegate Maggie McIntosh, Chair
Exhibit 1 is FIA’s November 1, 2016 status report, which indicated that certain corrective
actions had been completed to address the recommendation for one finding and that corrective
actions were ongoing for the remaining three findings. (FIA’s status report also addressed certain
recommendations that were not applicable to repeat findings; we did not assess the corrective
actions taken for these findings.) Our review determined that FIA had not taken sufficient actions
to correct findings 1, 4, and 5, while finding 3 was resolved.
A summary of OLA’s assessment of the status of each of the repeat audit findings is
included in the attached Exhibit 2. Exhibit 3 contains OLA’s assessment regarding each ofthe
three repeat findings thathadnotbeen resolved. Afterdiscussing ourreviewresults, FIA generally
agreed with the accuracy ofthe information presented. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation
extended to us by FIA during this review.
We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the JCR requirement. Please contact me if
you need additional information.

OLA’s Assessments Regarding Repeat Findings That Were Not Resolved
Prior Report Recommendation Finding ic
—
We recommend that FIA ensure that local departments investigate and resolve unverified
or missing recipient social security numbers, including those noted above, on a timely basis.
Status: Not Resolved
FIA has implemented certain automated procedures to help local departments ofsocial services
investigate and resolve CARES alerts related to unverified or missing recipient social security
numbers and has, according to its records, achieved a significant reduction in the number of
alerts outstanding for more than six months. (Each alert corresponds to one unverified or missing
social security number.) A comparison ofthe outstanding alerts as ofJanuary 2014 (at the time
ofour prior report finding) and January 2017 shows the reported reduction.
FIA Record of System Alerts Outstanding
as ofJanuary 2014 and January 2017
Outstanding Alerts
Total > 6 months > 1 year
January2014 49,600 18,000 10,500
January2017 11,500 1,500 900
While FIA’s records reflect that it has achieved a reduction in outstanding alerts for more than
six months, our review ofthe underlying data raises questions about reliability. Our comparison
ofFIA’s records ofoutstanding alerts as ofthe two dates identified 1,733 alerts that were
outstanding as ofJanuary 2014 and remained unresolved as ofJanuary 2017. However, only 351
ofthese alerts were classified as more than one year old as ofJanuary 2017. For example, FIA’s
records identified 985 alerts as being less than 30 days old at that date. FIA could not provide us
with an adequate explanation as to why the 985 alerts outstanding since the prior report were
now identified as less than 30 days old. Consequently, it is unclear whether sufficient action has
been taken to address outstanding alerts on a timely basis.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 4a
—
We recommend that FIA obtain adequate documentation, such as time and payroll
records, to verify the accuracy and propriety ofcontract billings.
Status: Not Resolved
The status report provided by FIA explained that DHR’s Office for Refugees and Asylees had
developed a comprehensive monitoring plan; however, the monitoring performed under the plan
does not include the types ofcontracts that were the subject ofthe prior report finding.
ConsequentLy, we again noted deficiencies in FIA’s review ofcontract billings. Specifically, we

--- Page 13 ---
tested October 2016 invoices for two ofthe three contracts included in our April 2015 audit
report. For both contracts, FIA had not obtained documentation to support invoiced amounts for
salaries and fringe benefits, which represented the majority ofthe charges billed. No tirnesheets
or other documentation were received to support critical data such as salary costs by employee
classification and the number ofhours and days worked.
An onsite review was performed by personnel from the DHR Bureau ofPolicy, Legislation and
Reporting for one ofthe two contracts, but there was no documentation to support that a
verification had been performed. during that review, ofspecific billings to the corresponding
time and payroll records. The October 2016 invoice we tested for this contract totaled $980,000
ofwhich $699,000 represented labor charges.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 5b
—
We recommend that FIA establish procedures to ensure that TDAP cases are closed in a
timely manner once SSA renders its final decision regarding a recipient’s application for
federal benefits.
Status: Not Resolved
Our tests disclosed that Temporary Disability Assistance Program (TDAP) cases were not closed
in a timely manner. TDAP is a State-funded program that provides assistance to low-income
disabled adults who are ineligible for other categories ofassistance and who are applying for
federal Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income. IDAP benefits
should cease when the federal Social Security Administration (SSA) renders a final decision
regarding a recipient’s application for federal benefits. Although FIA advised it had developed a
process to review TDAP cases for closure, based on our test results, this process does not appear
to be effective. Specifically, our review of 7 program recipients disclosed that each had received
TDAP payments in February 2017, even though SSA had rendered its final decision 4 to 24
months earlier, at which time payments should have ceased. TDAP payments made beyond
SSA”s decision date for these 7 recipients totaled $13,320.
