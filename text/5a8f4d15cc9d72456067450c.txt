AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Develop Strategy to Address Going Concern Issue
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: No
The Commission has a potential going concern issue, as it appears that they do not have the
resources to continue operating without using their reserve funds. The Commission is not
aggressively monitoring operating cash balances or developing strategies to increase revenues or
decrease expenses. During fiscal year 2016, the Commission used $70,000 in cash restricted for
future projects to cover operating expenses when there was no operating cash available. As of
June 30, 2016, the Commission had not reimbursed the reserve for these funds and did not
reimburse the reserve until August 2016. Historically, the Commission takes from 52 to 131 days to
repay the reserve funds. At the end of fiscal year 2016, the Commission’s deficit for restricted funds
totaled approximately $90,000. In addition, the Commission continues to annually set-aside funds
generated from operations to support future oyster work. The Commission experienced net losses
in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 of $54,000 and $59,000, respectively. These increasing losses
demonstrate the Commission’s inability to operate with a positive cash balance. In addition, while,
the Commission generated a profit of $11,000 in fiscal year 2016; the need to replace two heating
and air conditioning units totaling $18,000, negated any cash generated and created an overall loss
of $7,000.
The Commission decided to fund two oyster preservation projects totaling $400,000 over the
past six years, and did not consider the toll these projects would take on operating expenses. They
expected the programs to be self-sustaining; however, in addition to funding the projects at $50,000
per year each, the Commission has also diverted certain revenues, which were previously used for
operating expenses, for these projects. The diverted revenues include all oyster licenses, surcharges,
inspection taxes, and identification tags.
The Commission needs to research ways to increase revenues and evaluate in detail where
they can reduce expenses. In addition, the Commission needs to evaluate new projects in light of
their mission and purpose, which is the responsibility for adopting the rules, regulations, and licenses
for both commercial and recreational taking, catching, or attempting to catch fish, crabs, oysters,
and clams from the tidal Potomac River waters. The Virginia Potomac River Compact of 1958
established the Commission to conserve and improve all valuable fishery resources of the river.
While the preservation of the oyster population is important, concentrating all funding efforts in this
area without regard for other areas of responsibility and the need for funds for ongoing
administrative operations could result in the inability to remain a viable going concern.

Improve Financial Recording
Type: Internal Control and Compliance
Repeat: No
The Commission does not have accounting personnel with adequate knowledge of
accounting standards to properly record and process the Commissions’ uncommon financial
transactions. This has resulted in various inaccuracies, as described below, in the Commissions’
financial records.
During fiscal year 2016, the Administrative Assistant did not properly capitalize expenses for
capital assets. The Commission replaced two HVAC units totaling $18,502, which the Administrative
Assistant expensed to “Building Maintenance” rather than capitalizing the units as “Building
Improvements.” The Commission’s capitalization policy requires capitalization of all additions,
renovations, and repairs to capital assets that increase the economic benefits of the assets. In
addition, the policy requires capitalization for assets that have an expected useful life of greater than
one year and a value or cost of $5,000 or more at the date of acquisition.
The Administrative Assistant has not been reducing the retiree healthcare liability account
and the corresponding company paid healthcare expense account for the annual costs since they
started paying premiums for retirees in July 2012. The Commission reimbursed the operating
account(s) from the retiree healthcare investment account for the premium amounts, but did not
reduce the expense and liability accounts for these amounts. In addition, the Administrative
Assistant did not adjust the liability account for interest earned. These errors resulted in an
overstatement of the liability and expense accounts of $35,060, of which $24,767 was from prior
periods and $10,293 relates to fiscal year 2016.
Additionally, in completing the annual reimbursement from the healthcare investment
account, the Administrative Assistant incorrectly calculated the annual expense amount resulting in
a cumulative under-reimbursement of operating funds of $4,044.
Finally, a review of the Oyster Management Reserve (OMR) revealed that the prior Executive
Secretary incorrectly accounted for revenues and expenses of the reserve by removing them from
Commission operations. The Commission collects the membership fees, pays the seeding expenses,
and funded $200,000 over four years (fiscal years 2012 through 2015). However, there is no trust or
other legal document to require holding these funds for members of the reserve; therefore, there is
no basis to exclude these transactions from the Commission’s revenue and expense accounts. The
incorrect accounting resulted in a prior period adjustment of $37,434.
Overstatement of liabilities and expenses hinder the ability of the Commission to assess its
financial position and make sound financial decisions. The Commission should provide the
Administrative Assistant responsible for posting entries and accounting for Commission expenses
appropriate and relevant training in proper accounting standards to enable her to record normal and
uncommon transactions properly throughout the year. As the current Administrative Assistant is
retiring in December 2017, the Commission should take the opportunity to hire a replacement who
has experience and knowledge in proper accounting and bookkeeping procedures. In addition, the
2
Fiscal Year 2016

--- Page 9 ---
Commission should ensure that the Executive Secretary has adequate knowledge of accounting
procedures affording him the capability to determine that transactions recorded in the financial
system are proper and correct.
Prepare Bank Reconciliations Timely
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: No
During fiscal year 2016, the Commission did not prepare bank reconciliations timely. The
Commission holds five checking/savings accounts, which requires them to complete a total of 60
reconciliations. The Assistant Executive Secretary prepared reconciliations sixty to ninety days after
month end for 15 reconciliations or 25 percent. Due to these issues, we expanded our review of
reconciliations into fiscal year 2017. Between July 2016 and February 2017, the Assistant Executive
Secretary prepared bank reconciliations for all accounts between 65 and 90 days after each month
end for 60 percent of the reconciliations. In addition, the Executive Secretary did not monitor the
completion of reconciliations to ensure that they were completed timely.
The Commission policy manual does not outline a timeframe for the completion of the
reconciliations. Best practices suggest that the Commission should complete a reconciliation at least
monthly to ensure that transactions are correct and no fraud has occurred. The Commission should
establish guidelines for when reconciliations should be completed and update their policy manual.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve
and improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing
Virginia.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the
following sources.
Commission Revenues
Table 1
2015 2016
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000
Federal and other grants 50,837 63,754
Sport fishing licenses 140,003 143,678
Commercial fishing licenses 79,350 76,880
Commercial crab licenses 68,580 68,545
Commercial oyster licenses 34,230 88,262
Commercial license surcharge 34,900 38,250
Oyster bushel tax 5,016 11,698
Interest and miscellaneous 28,727 35,868
Total revenue $730,393 $815,865
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission’s revenues increased by 12 percent for fiscal year 2016 due primarily to
increases in the sales of oyster licenses. These license revenues increased due to an increase in
oyster production and allowing hand scraping of oysters around the Route 301 Bridge and at Swan
Island. These two areas have never before been open for oyster harvesting.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:
Commission Expenses
Table 2
2015 2016
Personnel services $398,085 $400,186
Development and repletion 146,222 126,171
Federal grant 34,860 62,427
Contractual services 101,619 93,844
Materials and supplies 62,154 59,930
Insurance (2) 7,176
Fixed assets 1,338 1,033
Total operating expenses 744,276 750,767
Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Retiree health care 53,500 53,500
Total expenses $797,776 $804,267
Source: Commission’s financial system
Total expenses were relatively stable over fiscal year 2016, increasing only one percent from
fiscal year 2015. This is attributable in part to the end of funding for future oyster development and
efforts to maintain level spending. However, increasing costs coupled with decreasing revenues
could be a concern for the Commission in the future.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2016 with an operating profit of $11,417, including funding
of the retiree healthcare trust. This is the first time in the last four years that the Commission
attained a profit.
However, the Commission is not retaining more cash each year and, in fact, ended the year
with a negative balance in the cash-operating fund as shown in Chart 1 below. In addition, funds
reserved for two oyster projects and authorized by the Commission in 2012 and 2013 are currently
in a deficit situation, as the Commission has used the cash reserves to pay operating expenses. For
further discussion on this issue, see the finding entitled “Develop Strategy to Address Going Concern
Issue” in the section “Audit Findings and Recommendations.”

The Commission closed fiscal year 2016 with an overall cash balance of $622,312, which was
a six percent increase ($37,592) over fiscal year 2015 levels. The increase is due to the timing of
expenses at year-end for the Oyster Management Reserve program in the Virginia investment pool
account. The Commission had approximately $62,000 in expenses related to fiscal year 2016 that
they did not pay until fiscal year 2017. The cash balance includes $245,467 in the Virginia and
Maryland investment pool accounts to fund future oyster work and $379,485 in a separate Virginia
investment pool account for retiree health care reserves as of June 30, 2016. The retiree healthcare
account is managed by a trust and legally cannot be used to fund operations. The Commission
earmarked the other two accounts for the Oyster Management Reserve and Rotational Natural
Oyster Harvest Program projects, and the Commission should not use the reserves to supplement
operating cash. The Commission has traditionally maintained sufficient operating cash to cover two
to three months of expenses. However, as shown in Chart 2 on the following page, as of
June 30, 2016, the Commission did not have any operating cash on hand to cover future expenses.
The Commission’s contributions to the oyster programs and deflection of other revenues to these
programs caused the drop in cash balances and reduced the Commission’s operating coverage to a
negative balance.

The Honorable Terence R. McAuliffe
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Robert D. Orrock, Sr.
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2016. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial
transactions in the Commission’s financial system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal
controls, and test compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with
applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent
of our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles,
classes of transactions, and account balances.

Appropriations
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate,
had been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance
with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit
procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and
contracts, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures,
including budgetary and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also
tested details of transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support
conclusions about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure
the samples selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate
evidence. We identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate,
we projected our results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts
recorded and reported in the Commission’s financial system, except as noted in the finding titled
“Improve Financial Recording” in the section entitled “Audit Findings and Recommendations.” The
financial information presented in this report came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted certain matters involving internal control and its operation and compliance with
applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements that require management’s attention
and corrective action. These matters are described in the section entitled “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.”
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on August 22, 2017. Management’s response to
the findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did
not audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
