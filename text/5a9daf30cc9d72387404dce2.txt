Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
July 1, 2016 to November 30, 2016
1) Department of Information Technology (DoIT) (9/12/16 – 22 pages – 7 Findings)
 Certain deficiencies were noted with DoIT’s processes for overseeing the State’s 33 major
information technology development projects (MITDPs) valued at $850 million that existed as of
June 2015. DoIT lacked sufficient documentation to support that it effectively monitored
MITDPs through its review of annual status reports and quarterly portfolio review meetings. Our
test of 20 quarterly portfolio reviews, pertaining to 5 MITDP projects, disclosed that DoIT could
not provide any documentation that the meetings occurred for 3 reviews. For 10 other reviews,
DoIT did not document the matters discussed, nor did it document whether significant corrective
actions were required and, if so, what these actions entailed.
 DoIT had not established a process to independently evaluate project managers (OPMs) hired
through a vendor to oversee the 33 MITDPs, nor had DoIT developed specific project
monitoring documentation and reporting requirements for their project management activities.
In addition, DoIT had not established a means to ensure that the vendor assigned sufficient
OPM resources to monitor MITDPs on its behalf.
 Comprehensive policies were lacking to guide decisions and define recordkeeping requirements
pertaining to changes in project scope, schedule, and costs (referred to as rebaselining). Since
a rebaselining policy had not been established, records were not maintained to identify the
reasons and impact for any of the 12 changes made on projects during fiscal year 2014.
Furthermore, a policy was not established to govern the use of Independent Verification and
Validation assessments (IV&V) of MITDPs as an independent means to assess their health and
to identify areas that need improvement to help the projects be successful. DoIT had only
initiated an IV&V for one of the MITDPs as of November 2015.
 Certain security control deficiencies were noted relating to the networks and computer
resources under DoIT’s responsibility. For example, certain contractors had been provided
unnecessary network level access to workstations and servers, and numerous workstations
were not appropriately protected from malware.

2) Comptroller of Maryland – Revenue Administration Division (RAD) (9/16/16 – 24 pages –
8 Findings)
 RAD had not determined the underlying cause(s) for erroneous subdivision codes recorded in
its automated tax records for numerous taxpayers in one county, which affected distributions of
local income taxes. The Comptroller of Maryland conducted a review that disclosed that
addresses for more than 14,000 taxpayers in Montgomery County were not properly coded in
the State’s automated tax system, resulting in $8.7 million in local income taxes being
incorrectly distributed to certain special taxing areas within Montgomery County and the County
at large for tax years 2010 to 2014. Certain steps had been taken to correct the distribution
errors, which resulted in 15 taxing areas receiving a net under-distribution ranging from $10,000
to $6.1 million and 8 taxing areas receiving a net over-distribution ranging from $5,000 to $4.9
million. RAD had not conducted a detailed analysis to determine what caused the subdivision
coding errors, making it uncertain if other jurisdictions in the State also experienced this
problem, and the actions needed to resolve the matter.
 RAD lacked sufficient policies and procedures to ensure that the proper subdivision codes were
assigned to taxpayers in the automated tax system. For example, comprehensive written
guidance was not provided to employees who were responsible for identifying the proper
subdivision codes (based on tax return addresses) when automated processes were
unsuccessful. In addition, RAD did not ensure the sources of information used by these
employees were always current and complete.
 Required documentation was not always on file to support out-of-state tax credits claimed on
paper tax returns filed by individual taxpayers. Our examination of 20 tax returns submitted for
tax year 2013 that claimed out-of-state tax credits totaling $35 million disclosed 6 returns for
which credits totaling $27.2 million were allowed by RAD, even though the required
documentation was not on file. According to RAD records, out-of-state tax credits totaling
$111.9 million were 15 claimed by taxpayers on approximately 14,300 paper tax returns for tax
year 2013.
 Significant financial adjustments to corporate taxpayer accounts processed by one RAD unit
were not always reviewed by supervisory personnel. For example, there was no documented
supervisory review for 3 of 10 adjustments tested that reduced corporate taxpayer liabilities by
$23.4 million.
 Nonfinancial adjustments to critical taxpayer account information, such as a change to a
taxpayer’s address or identification number, were not adequately controlled. A review of
procedures in place at three units responsible for processing adjustments disclosed that none of
the units had adequate procedures in place to ensure the propriety of the adjustments.

3) Department of Information Technology (DoIT) – Department of State Police (DSP) –
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) – Resource Sharing Lease Agreements (Special
Review) (11/18/16 – 30 pages – 8 Findings)
We conducted a review of an allegation we received related to resource sharing lease agreements
(RSA) between two telecommunications companies and DoIT, DSP, or DNR. The RSAs provide
compensation to the State from the telecom companies, which are allowed to use the State’s
communications infrastructure, such as towers, to install, operate, and maintain communications
systems. We reviewed 10 RSAs and related renewals dating back to 1996 with related
compensation (including renewal periods) valued at $5.9 million as of June 2016.
 As the oversight agency, DoIT did not maintain comprehensive records of the RSAs, nor
effectively oversee the RSAs and related renewals. Beginning in 2001, lease payments from
the two companies for these RSAs were being deposited into escrow accounts maintained
outside of the State’s control by a law firm, and DSP and DNR did not establish effective
oversight of the accounts’ activity. As of June 2016, deposits into and withdrawals from the
accounts totaled $4.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, and the balances in the accounts
totaled $536,700.
 DoIT became aware of, and questioned, these RSAs in April 2011, but took no substantive
action until 2015. In July 2015, the law firm was directed to cease making any payments from
the escrow accounts and DNR undertook an internal audit of the funds. The resulting January
2016 DNR report concluded the escrow accounts effectively created an “off-budget” pool of
funds that could be spent without regard to the State budget or procurement requirements.
 DoIT, DSP, and DNR did not maintain a complete list of their own RSAs, obtain appropriate
approvals (when required), maintain inventories of telecom equipment on their towers, or ensure
that all compensation due under the RSAs was collected. For the 10 RSAs reviewed, we
identified uncollected compensation totaling an estimated $917,000.
 Escrow account financial transactions were not accounted for on State records and the law firm
retained related interest earnings totaling $90,900.
 One DSP and one DNR employee unilaterally directed the firm to make purchases of telecom
equipment and services from the escrow accounts. We identified certain questionable activities
by one of these individuals, related to a tower installation and a unique arrangement with one
telecom company, which we referred to the Office of the Attorney General.

4) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Development Disabilities Administration
(DDA) (11/18 /16 – 26 pages – 10 Findings)
In our preceding audit report, we reported that DDA’s accountability and compliance level was
unsatisfactory in accordance with the rating system that we established in conformity with State law.
Based on the results of our current audit, we have concluded that DDA has made some
improvement in its fiscal and compliance operations and, accordingly, DDA’s accountability and
compliance level is no longer unsatisfactory.
 Prior to fiscal year 2015, DDA directed providers to collect certain copayments from consumers,
referred to as contribution to care (CTC), for services that should have been paid for with State
and federal funds. In fiscal year 2014, DDA determined that it was incorrectly directing
providers to collect CTC from virtually all Medicaid-eligible consumers residing in residential
habitation facilities. The amount improperly collected could have been $4.2 million annually.
DDA’s legal counsel concluded that DDA had no legal obligation to return these funds.
 DDA did not adequately monitor the 18 contractors that provided resource/service coordinators
who were responsible for planning, coordinating, and monitoring all services delivered to
approximately 25,000 DDA consumers with service expenditures totaling $876 million in fiscal
year 2015. Specifically, DDA did not determine whether the coordinators were ensuring that
consumers received the required medical, habilitative, or rehabilitative services from providers,
as stipulated in the consumers’ individual service plans, and that Medicaid eligibility
reassessments were conducted timely.
 DDA did not negotiate the contract rates for the professional positions contained in two services
contracts with a vendor to assist in the financial restructuring of DDA operations for which it paid
$8.1 million. The contract rates for four vendor employees ranged from $195 to $416 per hour,
for annualized costs of $378,300 and $665,496, respectively.
 DDA lacked an effective means to ensure payments for the financial restructuring contracts
were commensurate with the completion of contract deliverables. Also, DDA did not effectively
monitor the contracts and the related payments. Certain deliverables were not received, vendor
status reports were not always obtained or reviewed to determine the propriety of invoices, and
DDA authorized the vendor to perform work outside the scope of the contracts.
 DDA did not verify critical adjustments that were processed in its Provider Consumer
Information System, resulting in errors, such as overpayments to providers, going undetected,
including one totaling $330,000. DDA also inappropriately stored certain sensitive personally
identifiable information in the System database without adequate safeguards. Fiscal year 2015
expenditures processed through the system totaled approximately $915 million.
