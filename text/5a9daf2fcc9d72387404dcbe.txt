Audit Overview
(cid:190) We conducted an audit based on an allegation
received through our fraud hotline related to
possible deficiencies in the recording and
abatement of certain fees paid by offenders under
the Drinking Driver Monitor Program (DDMP)
administered by the Division of Parole and
Probation (DPP).
(cid:190) DPP supervises offenders on parole and probation
to ensure they are upholding requirements set by
the courts and the Parole Commission.
(cid:190) The objectives of the audit were (1) to evaluate
procedures and controls over the intake process
when offenders are sentenced to probation,
including the assessment of fees and restitution;
and (2) to identify DDMP cases for which
applicable monthly fees may have not been
properly assessed.
(cid:190) As of July 2015, there were approximately 14,000
open DDMP cases.

Probation Intake Process
(cid:190) Offenders report to one of 44 DPP field offices per
the probation order from the courts. Twenty DPP
field offices handle DDMP cases.
(cid:190) DPP staff record offender information into the
Offender Case Management System (OCMS) and
the Offender-Based State Correctional Information
System II (OBSCIS II).
(cid:190) OCMS is a case management system used to
monitor the offenders, and OBSCIS II is used to
account for fines, costs, fees, and restitution (FCFR)
due and payments received from offenders.
(cid:190) OCMS was implemented in December 2012. While
certain OCMS offender demographic data interface
with OBSCIS II, FCFR data do not, and must be
manually entered into OBSCIS II.
(cid:190) Offenders pay a monthly supervision fee and DDMP
fee (if a DDMP case). Fees are manually calculated
at intake by DPP staff. Supervision fees collected
during FY 2014 totaled $7.5 million and DDMP fees
collected totaled $6 million.

DDMP Fund - Background
(cid:190) State law, effective July 2005, created the DDMP
fund as a special, non-lapsing fund to be used for
all DDMP costs, and imposed a $45 monthly fee
on all DDMP offenders.
(cid:190) The DDMP fund had a deficit balance at June 30,
2008, requiring a $1.5 million deficiency
appropriation, and in June 2009 the monthly fee
was raised to $55.
(cid:190) DDMP revenues exceeded expenditures during FYs
2010 and 2011; however, beginning with FY 2012,
expenditures have exceeded revenues each year
through FY 2015.
(cid:190) During FY 2014, general funds of $447,248 and a
deficiency appropriation of $400,000 funded
expenditures of $847,248 in excess of the DDMP
fund balance.
(cid:190) During FY 2015 only payroll costs were charged to
the DDMP fund. Non-payroll costs (typically
$880,000 a year) were charged to general funds,
leaving a balance of $223,451 in the DDMP fund.

Key Findings
(cid:190)DPP did not revise its offender intake processing
policies and procedures manual when a new
automated case management system (OCMS) was
implemented in December 2012. OCMS
substantially changed and added more complexity to
the intake process. Our review of intake processes
in 6 field offices (responsible for 40% of probation
cases) found certain inconsistencies.
(cid:190)Procedures and controls at the field offices were
insufficient to ensure all fees and restitution were
properly calculated, assessed, and recorded. OLA
tests found errors in both over and under-
assessments of fees or restitution.
(cid:190)User access in OCMS was not properly controlled
and many users had excessive access.
(cid:190)An OLA match identified 3,983 cases in which DDMP
fees were potentially under-assessed by a total of
$2.1 million. OLA tests found data errors in 32 of 45
cases tested. Because of certain data limitations, a
reasonable estimate of total DDMP fee under-
assessments is not determinable.

Probation Intake Process
(cid:190)DPP did not revise its offender intake processing
policies and procedures manual when a new
automated case management system was
implemented in December 2012 (Finding 1).
(cid:131) After OCMS was implemented, DPP’s Operations
Manual was not revised and adequate training
was not provided to guide intake staff on the new
multi-step data entry process, and we noted
inconsistencies between field offices. For
example, staff at 2 of 6 field offices we reviewed
were unaware that DDMP exemptions (for
disabled offenders) should be recorded in OCMS,
which led to inconsistencies with OBSCIS II when
the fees were not recorded.
(cid:131) DPP did not have a formal policy stating whether
to reduce DDMP fees when a case is abated by
the courts after certain probation terms were met.
A policy exists for supervision fees but not DDMP
fees. Three of 6 field offices reviewed were
reducing DDMP fees, while the others were not.

Probation Intake Process (continued)
(cid:190)DPP had not established adequate procedures and
controls to ensure that all fees and restitution were
properly assessed to offenders and recorded at four
field offices reviewed (Finding 2).
(cid:131) Initial accountability was not established over
probation orders (such as court orders) received
to ensure that all orders were processed and
recorded.
(cid:131) As of May 2015, none of the field offices reviewed
had established a documented supervisory review
for the intake process to ensure that all fees and
restitution were properly calculated, assessed,
and recorded in OBSCIS II, including those cases
transferred from other field offices.
(cid:131) OLA testing found clerical errors in 9 of 20 cases
opened at these four field offices in FY 2015.
These errors included not assessing DDMP fees,
over-assessing DDMP fees or supervision fees,
and over-assessing court-ordered restitution.

OCMS User Access
(cid:190)Procedures and controls over user access in OCMS
were not sufficient. Many users had excessive
access, defined system roles were not appropriately
restricted, and data input controls were not
comprehensive. As of May 2015, there were 1,696
users with access (Finding 3).
(cid:131) There was no documented supervisory approval for
granting and modifying user access in OCMS,
including access granted upon implementation.
(cid:131) DPP did not periodically review the propriety of
access for the 1,359 users who had OCMS edit
access. We noted that 11 of 14 users tested had
improper or unnecessary access, which could allow
errors in criminal records. Because changes to
critical OCMS data were not recorded, these errors
could remain undetected.
(cid:131) Controls were not comprehensive to ensure all
critical information was properly entered into
OCMS. For example, until June 2015, probation
period ending date was not a required field.

Data Match Test Results
(cid:190)We conducted a targeted match of OCMS and
OBSCIS II data which identified 3,983 cases in
which DDMP fees were potentially under-assessed
by $2.1 million. We tested 45 of these cases for
which DDMP fees totaling $6,600 and supervision
fees totaling $15,210 had been recorded. Our
tests found that DDMP fees totaling $42,625 and
supervision fees totaling $11,300 were not
properly assessed in OBSCIS II for 32 cases
(Finding 4).
(cid:131) For 21 of 45 cases tested, DDMP fees and/or
supervision fees totaling $38,360 were not
assessed.
(cid:131) For 7 cases, DDMP fees totaling $10,230 were
incorrectly recorded as either supervision fees or
testing fees.
(cid:131) For 1 case, DDMP fees were mistakenly waived
rather than supervision fees of $1,980.
(cid:131) For 3 cases, DDMP fees were under-assessed by
$3,355.

Data Match Test Results (continued)
(cid:190)For the remaining 13 of the 45 cases tested,
although the fees assessed were correctly recorded
in OBSCIS II, the cases were identified by our match
due to other data problems, including the failure to
record a DDMP exemption flag or an inaccurately
recorded probation period.
(cid:190)Based on our review of 5 of the 32 cases with errors
that had subsequently closed, processes in place to
identify fee assessment errors at case closure were
ineffective. Corrections to the assessed fees had
not been made in OBSCIS II in any of these cases.
The review at case closure represents the last
chance to assess fees prior to closing the case and
referring any recorded owed fees to the Central
Collection Unit.
(cid:190)Because of data reliability problems in OCMS and
OBSCIS II, and certain limitations in our match, the
extent to which DDMP fees were actually under-
assessed is unknown.

Data Match Test Results (continued)
(cid:190)The proper assessment and collection of DDMP
fees are important since DDMP collections are
credited to the DDMP fund which, as previously
mentioned, has not been sufficient to fund the full
costs of DDMP.
(cid:190)As a result of this review, DPP initiated a review in
June 2015 of all open cases to ensure that fees and
restitution were properly recorded in OBSCIS II.

Conclusions
DPP should
(cid:190)establish comprehensive intake guidance and
training that addresses all critical processes, and
establish a formal policy on the handling of DDMP
fees when a case is abated;
(cid:190)establish initial accountability for all probation
orders and an independent supervisory review of
the intake process to ensure all fees and restitution
are properly assessed and recorded in OBSCIS II;
(cid:190)establish a formal, documented process for
granting, modifying, and reviewing OCMS user
access, restrict access for users with improper
access, enhance input validation controls, and
produce reports of critical data changes for review;
(cid:190)take immediate corrective action on cases
identified in our audit for which fees were not
properly assessed; and
(cid:190)consider performing data matches between OCMS
and OBSCIS II to identify errors and
inconsistencies.
