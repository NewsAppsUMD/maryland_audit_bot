INTRODUCTION
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Thank you for the opportunity to present the results of our review of the audit reports
submitted by each local government for the year ended June 30, 2023, which are summarized
in our report entitled Review of Local Government Audit Reports dated August 26, 2024. For
the 206 audit reports due, we found that the local governments have generally complied with
generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards. Additionally, local
governments generally appeared to be in good financial condition at that time. When areas of
noncompliance or potential financial problems were noted, we sent letters describing the
conditions to the local governments and, when appropriate, to their auditors in an effort to
ensure the conditions do not recur. Our presentation will address the following areas:
1. Overview of the local government auditing process
2. Problems disclosed by our review of local government audits
3. Follow-up action taken on problems
4. Concluding comments
OVERVIEW
Generally, each county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district located in Maryland is
required by law to have an annual audit. Based on the provisions of Title 16 of the Local Government
Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, each local government is required to have its financial
statements audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. This law also requires that the financial statements be presented in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the results of the audits be
submitted to the Office of Legislative Audits.
Most local governments must file their reports on or before October 31 for the preceding
fiscal year ended June 30; however, local governments whose populations exceed 400,000, and
certain other counties, must file on or before December 31 of each year. In addition, extensions
may be granted to local governments for valid reasons. By law, certain small local governments
may request a waiver of the annual filing requirement and instead only have an audit once every
four years. Fifteen local governments requested, and were granted, waivers of the annual filing
requirement for fiscal year 2023.
As provided for under the law, we have issued audit guidelines that address the basic
requirements that must be met by the local governments and their independent auditors. While the
independent auditors determine the specific procedures necessary in each audit, the guidelines are
intended to help ensure that a minimum acceptable level of quality is maintained for audits and
financial reports of local governments.
The Office of Legislative Audits performs a desk review of each audit report to identify
areas of noncompliance by using a quality control checklist for government audits published by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For example, we generally determine
whether the auditor's report was presented in accordance with generally accepted auditing
2

standards, whether the local government's financial statements were presented in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and whether financial statement disclosures were
adequate.
Our desk review also includes a review to identify noncompliance with certain State laws,
such as Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the Annotated Code of Maryland which
requires all deposits held in banks by local governments be insured or otherwise collateralized.
Additionally, our desk review includes a basic financial analysis of each local government. This
analysis includes a review of various financial trends and ratios (for example, ratio of general fund
balance to annual expenditures) to provide some insight regarding potential financial problems at the
local government level.
Upon completion of each year's review, we prepare a report summarizing the areas of
noncompliance with the audit guidelines (for example, departures from generally accepted
accounting principles) or with State law (for example, uncollateralized cash deposits). In
addition, when applicable, our report discloses potential financial problems at the local
government level such as deficit general fund balances and unfavorable financial trends and
ratios. This summary report is submitted to the Comptroller of Maryland and the Executive
Director of the Department of Legislative Services, as required by law, as well as other
interested parties.
Finally, State law requires applicable counties to file reports with our Office on their
reviews of financial reports and audits of special taxing districts created by the counties. Our
annual summary reports also include the results of our reviews of such financial information on
county-created special taxing districts.
PROBLEMS DISCLOSED
As reflected on Exhibit A, page 1, most local governments have substantially complied
with standards over the past several years. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, 206 reports
were due from local governments. Our review disclosed that 45 local governments had reports
that contained areas of noncompliance with the audit guidelines. These areas of noncompliance
were not of such an extent so as to cast doubt on the reliability of the underlying financial
statements. The number of local governments with reports that contained areas of noncompliance
slightly increased from 37 in 2022.
In addition, our review disclosed areas of noncompliance with State law for 13 local
governments that had unsecured cash deposits. Additionally, our review disclosed one local
government with a potential financial problem during fiscal year 2023. See Exhibit A, page 2
for a summary of these areas and problems over the past several years. Some local governments
had more than one area of noncompliance with the guidelines.
The more significant and frequent problems disclosed by our review were as follows:
Timeliness:
1. Local governments did not timely file an audit report as required or failed to do so.
As of April 30, 2024, twenty six local governments were delinquent in filing audit one
or more audit reports as required by the Local Government Article of the Annotated
Code of Maryland. Furthermore, twenty four local governments submitted twenty
seven audit reports after the filing date required by law.

*The audit report for this fiscal year was subsequently submitted after the April 30, 2024 cut off and is
therefore not included in our current review. As such, it will be included with our review of fiscal year 2024
audit reports.
** As noted below in item 3, the auditor was unable to express an opinion on the Town’s financial statements
for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. While the submission of the audit report satisfies the technical requirement of
the law, we believe the Town could be treated as a non-filer for these years because the financial statements
may not be able to be relied upon.
Auditor's Work:
2. The auditors’ reports for three local governments were not presented in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards.
Qualified/ Adverse/ Disclaimer of Opinion:
3. The auditor’s report for one local government contained a disclaimer of opinion over
the local government as a whole. Specifically, the auditors for the Town of Princess
Anne’s fiscal year 2022 financial statements could not provide an opinion because the
auditor was unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in order to express
an opinion on the financial statements. While the submission of the audit report
satisfies the technical requirement of the law, the inability to express an opinion
diminishes the value of the audit because the financial statements may not be able to
be relied upon. This same area of noncompliance was also noted in regard to the
Town’s fiscal year 2021 financial statements.
Local Government Financial Presentation:
4. Financial statements submitted by seventeen local governments did not present all
required statements or the presentation was inappropriate.
5. Financial statements for three local governments lacked adequate disclosures in the
statements and/or accompanying notes.
Compliance:
6. We noted that thirteen local governments had unsecured cash deposits as of June 30,
2023.
Potential Financial Issues:
7. One local government with a potential financial problem was identified. Specifically,
the auditor's report for the Upper Potomac River Commission — Waste Treatment
Plant, Trunk Sewer and Municipal Connecting System Fund referenced the Fund’s
notes to the financial statements describing an uncertainty regarding the Fund's ability
to continue as a going concern. The notes to the Fund's financial statements stated
that the Fund's management is in the process of addressing how it will fulfill the
Fund's obligations, given its economic dependence on a private corporation.
FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
A letter describing the areas of noncompliance with the audit guidelines noted during our
review was sent to each local government and its independent auditor. The letters requested that the
matters be examined to avoid a recurrence in subsequent audits.

--- Page 6 ---
The two local governments that failed to file audit reports for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and
2023 were reported to the Executive Director of the Department of Legislative Services. If these
reports are not filed, the Comptroller of Maryland, acting upon the advice of the Executive Director,
is authorized by law to discontinue the payment of all funds, grants, or State aid to which the local
governments are entitled.
For areas of noncompliance with State law pertaining to unsecured cash deposits, our
Office requested the applicable local governments to provide written descriptions of the actions
to be taken to eliminate the conditions, when appropriate. We reviewed and evaluated the
responses to these requests, received to date, and found the indicated actions sufficient.
Additionally, as requested by the Committee, when letters were sent to local governments
regarding noncompliance with State laws, copies of the letters were also sent to the appropriate
members of the Maryland General Assembly.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the Office of Legislative Audits functions in an oversight capacity by issuing
audit guidelines, reviewing local government audit reports for compliance with standards and
regulations, and notifying the local governments and their auditors of any deficiencies noted. We
believe that these efforts have helped improve the quality of audits and have promoted fiscal
accountability among local governments in Maryland.
To further improve the quality of local government audits, we participate in various
efforts to make technical information available to local governments, and respond to technical
inquiries from local governments and their auditors.
We will be happy to answer any questions you may have on this presentation.
