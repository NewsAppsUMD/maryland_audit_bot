Audit Overview
(cid:190) Audit report, which covered the period from 5/05 to
2/08, included 5 findings with 1 of those repeated
from the preceding audit report.
(cid:190) UEF pays workers’ compensation awards, including
medical payments, to claimants who failed to receive
payment from uninsured employers. The major source
of funding for awards and UEF operating expenses is
a 1% assessment on employers and insurance
companies for all WCC death or permanent disability
settlements and awards.
(cid:190) For FY08, UEF assessments totaled $6.2 million and
claim payments totaled $6.1 million ($3.3 million of
which uninsured employers should reimburse to UEF).
UEF operating expenses totaled $1.1 million.
(cid:190) The balance of the Fund at June 30, 2008 was $12.9
million. UEF’s accounts receivable balance at 1/09
was $26.6 million, most of which had been referred
to the State’s Central Collection Unit.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) UEF relied extensively on the Subsequent Injury
Fund (SIF) for accounting services, including
receiving and processing payments made to UEF,
maintaining computerized UEF accounts
receivable records, preparing UEF billing
statements and aging reports, and processing
UEF claim disbursements.
(cid:190) UEF did not have adequate processes in place to
ensure that UEF transactions and activity,
including those processed by SIF, were fully and
properly accounted for, including:
(cid:131) assessments and medical payment
receivables ($9.5 million in FY 08)
(cid:131) cash receipts ($6.3 million in FY 08 )
(cid:131) claim payments ($6.1 million in FY 08).

Cash Receipts
UEF had not established adequate internal control
over its cash receipts which were initially received
by both UEF and SIF. (Finding 4)
(cid:131) UEF mailed its cash receipts ($296,000
during FY 08) to SIF rather than depositing
them directly.
(cid:131) UEF did not receive documentation for
amounts received on its behalf at SIF ($6
million during FY 08), nor evidence for any
deposits made on its behalf.
(cid:131) UEF did not review applicable RSTARS
reports to ensure it was properly credited for
all of UEF’s cash receipts.

Claim Payments
UEF did not perform verifications of claim
payments to ensure that they were accurately
processed by SIF. (Finding 5)
(cid:131) UEF issued claim payment authorizations to
SIF for the total amount of awards rather
than providing the periodic payment
amounts, dates, and payment terms.
(cid:131) UEF expected SIF to determine and
calculate the proper claim payment
streams, but did not verify SIF’s work.
(cid:131) Testing disclosed that certain claim
payments were made in lump-sum rather
than being paid in smaller amounts on a
weekly basis, in accordance with the terms
of WCC awards.
