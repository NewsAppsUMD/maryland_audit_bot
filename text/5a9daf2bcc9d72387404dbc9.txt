Overview of Repeat Audi t Findings
 OLA issues about 70 fiscal compliance audit
reports each year, containing more than 300
recommendations.
 Virtually all recommendations are accepted by
agencies.
 As of June 2002, 43% of findings were repeated in
the first subsequent audit report (usually three
years later).
 As of June 2011, 26% of findings were repeated in
the first subsequent audit report, indicating
significant improvement since the follow-up
process was originally implemented in 2002.
 As of June 2011, 10% of findings were repeated
after the second subsequent audit.

Authority for the Follow-u p Process
 Chapter 512, Laws of Maryland 2006, effective
October 1, 2006, addressed the issue of repeat
audit findings.
 Agencies with five or more repeat audit findings are
required to provide an initial status report to OLA on
corrective actions taken on all audit findings within
nine months of the related audit reports.
 Updated status reports must be provided quarterly
until OLA determines that satisfactory progress has
been made on all findings, or until the next audit
begins.
 The goal is to have agencies focus on audit issues
and increase their commitment to resolving audit
findings by requiring them to periodically report their
implementation efforts.
 OLA had implemented a similar follow-up process in
2002 which, over a four-year period, involved 67
agencies. That process was essentially continued
under the 2006 law.

Results of the Follow-up P rocess Since 2006
 To date, 39 audits (involving 28 agencies) had
five or more repeat findings, requiring the
applicable agencies to submit quarterly status
reports.
 One or more quarterly reports have been
submitted for 38 audits to collectively report the
status of 515 audit findings.
 For the remaining audit, the first status report is
due in June 2012. This audit had 11 audit
findings.
 The status report process has concluded for 31
audits.

Results of the Follow-up P rocess (continued)
 For the 31 audits for which the status report
process has concluded, the reports indicated that
 For 6 audits, the agencies reported that
satisfactory progress had been achieved on all
71 findings, and
 For 25 audits, the agencies collectively
reported that satisfactory progress had been
achieved on 79% of their findings. Although
full compliance had not been achieved, status
reports were discontinued because the
subsequent audits had begun.
 The subsequent audits have been completed for
26 of these 31 audits.
 For 16 cases, the subsequent audits showed
that agencies’ progress in implementing the
audit recommendations was less than what
was reported.
 11 of the 16 cases, the agencies again
required follow-up.

Conclusion
 The follow-up processes used by OLA since
2002 have shown that the increased emphasis
on implementing audit recommendations has
contributed to an overall reduction in repeat
audit findings.
 Since 2002, the percentage of repeat audit
findings has decreased from 43% to 26% in
2011.
 While overall results show improvement, some
agencies continue to have challenges in
reducing repeat audit findings.
 OLA will continue to monitor the impact of the
repeat finding law on future audits.
