Key Findings – Other Issues
Procurement and Disbursements – (p. 16)
(cid:131) Procurement policies did not address all categories
of goods and services purchased, specify
procurement methods to be used, and required
levels for approvals.
Facilities Construction and Maintenance– (p. 32)
(cid:131) Change orders for construction projects were not
reviewed and approved by the Board.

formal evaluation of facility usage had not been
completed.

of food staff productivity should be considered.
