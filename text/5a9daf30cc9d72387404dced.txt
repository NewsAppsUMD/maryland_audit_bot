Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016
1) Department of Transportation (MDOT) – Secretary’s Office (2/01/16 – 15 pages – 3
Findings)
 MDOT did not establish an adequate process to verify that operating and capital grants awarded
to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) were properly calculated by
WMATA. MDOT did not document its review of the annual calculations, could not explain the
nature and extent of the reviews, and did not obtain certain documentation to verify the
calculations. Also, MDOT’s most recent audit of the annual grant agreements was conducted
for FY 2009. Operating and capital grant funds awarded to WMATA for FY 2014 totaled
approximately $409.6 million. OLA found that:
o MDOT did not obtain appropriate documentation to support Metrobus ridership, which was
one of the four factors used to determine a $106.6 million portion of the 2014 subsidy for that
service. WMATA used 2008 ridership data.
o WMATA’s calculation of a $63.7 million component of the operating subsidy for MetroAccess
paratransit was inconsistent with the formula approved by the WMATA Board of Directors.
o MDOT did not obtain documentation supporting certain 2014 adjustments, such as an $11.6
million reduction in the overall MDOT subsidy purportedly related to 2011 and 2012
operating deficits disclosed in WMATA’s audited financial statements.
o MDOT did not obtain detailed budget documentation to support a $69.5 million component of
the 2014 capital grant or a required reconciliation of WMATA’s 2013 budgeted and actual
capital expenditures to support a $10.7 million increase in the 2014 grant.
 MDOT did not always comply with State procurement regulations and awarded two contracts for
amounts substantially higher than could be supported by the related bid documentation. OLA’s
review of 5 competitive procurements, totaling approximately $55.7 million, and all 9 sole source
procurements awarded during the audit period, totaling $17.3 million, found that:
o MDOT did not properly secure vendor bids sent to MDOT email accounts for 3 information
technology related contract awards totaling $31.3 million.
o MDOT could not provide any documentation (such as a date stamp or email) that bids had
been received by the submission deadline for one contract totaling $20.9 million.
o For 2 competitively bid and 9 sole source contracts, totaling $24.4 million and $17.3 million,
respectively, the awards were not published on eMaryland Marketplace, as required.
o Two contracts totaling approximately $10 million were awarded for amounts higher than
could be supported by the winning vendor bids, which were $5.6 million.
 MDOT did not monitor employment agreements with two individuals. As a result, payments to
one individual exceeded the contract amount by $142,000 and for the second individual,
payments totaling $249,000 were made for services provided after the related agreement had
expired.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016
2) Maryland Public Broadcasting Commission (MPBC) (6/13/16 – 16 pages – 6 Findings)
 MPBC’s procurement policy did not contain certain provisions required by State law for entities
with exemptions from State procurement regulations, including critical provisions regarding
solicitation requirements and when competitive bidding should be used, and revisions to this
policy were not approved by its governing commission. For seven contracts tested, totaling $8
million, that were awarded under MPBC’s procurement exemption between January 2012 and
October 2014, documentation did not exist to support that four contracts individually valued over
$500,000 had been approved by MPBC’s commission and the three other contracts valued
between $50,000 and $500,000 had been reported to MPBC’s commission.
 MPBC did not always comply with State procurement regulations for non-exempt sole source
and competitively bid contract awards. Our test of three sole source procurements totaling
approximately $1.4 million and four competitively bid procurements totaling $2.7 million related
to contracts awarded between January 2013 and April 2015 disclosed certain deficiencies for
each of these procurements. For example, MPBC did not prepare formal justifications to
support that only the contracted vendors could provide the necessary services for two sole
source contract procurements totaling $928,000 for television ratings statistics and market
research analysis services.
 MPBC significantly understated the approximate quantity of mailings in its contract procurement
solicitation for direct marketing and fundraising services, which could have affected the vendors’
bidding decisions as well as the outcome of the bid evaluation process. MPBC had solicited
competitive bids for these services, received two bids, and determined the incumbent vendor
was the only qualified bidder. However, nine months after the contract began, MPBC noticed
that its authorized contract funding of $476,500 (of which $188,325 was for the initial 18-month
period of the contract) was almost fully spent and that it had made a significant error in its
estimated mailings in its procurement solicitation, which affected the contract value. In August
2015, MPBC obtained Board of Public Works’ approval to increase the value of the initial 18-
month contract from $188,325 to $524,133 (an increase of 178 percent).
 MPBC did not adequately monitor contract terms and payments for three contracts tested
related to fundraising services and did not obtain relevant support to evaluate the
reasonableness of the amount it was charged by the Public Broadcasting Service for its annual
subscription dues, which exceeded $3 million.
 MPBC did not periodically review user access capabilities for critical fundraising systems, and
numerous users had unnecessary access to donor information that is required to be kept
confidential by State law.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016
3) Board of Public Works (BPW) – Interagency Committee on School Construction (IAC)
(6/15/16 – 11 pages – 3 Findings)
 IAC had a significant backlog of school maintenance inspection results that had not been
finalized and formally issued to Local Education Agencies (LEA). IAC’s intended practice was to
report to each LEA the inspection results for the entire year at one time, generally at the end of
the fiscal year. However, as of December 31, 2015, IAC had not issued inspection reports to the
applicable LEAs for 489 of the 679 maintenance inspections (approximately 72 percent)
performed during FYs 2013, 2014, and 2015. Of the remaining 190 inspection results that were
issued, the reports for 114 were issued 12 to 30 months past the end of the fiscal years in which
the inspections were performed.
In addition, during the aforementioned three-year period, IAC inspections concluded that the
overall conditions at 25 schools in three LEAs were “not adequate,” including 8 inspections
performed during the period between May 2013 and November 2014, for which the results had
not been issued at the time of our review. Deficiencies that could affect the health and safety of
students and staff at these schools, such as unsanitary conditions and fire safety issues, were
identified. According to IAC records, as of January 5, 2016, there were 1,392 public schools in
Maryland.
Similar conditions were commented upon in our preceding audit report.
 Four employees could record critical project information in the IAC’s construction project
accounting system, including new contracts, change orders, and contract expenditures, without
independent supervisory review and approval. Also, as of the time of our review, no automated
controls, such as on-line approvals of transactions, had been established in the construction
project accounting system. The project accounting system is IAC’s official record of the State’s
public school construction project activity, including project requirements, project costs, and
vendor information. The system serves as a critical source during the invoice approval process
for ensuring that disbursements for construction projects are proper and for controlling project
budget allocations.
 IAC had not resolved a matter, commented upon in our prior report, involving an $890,277 debt
that was to be assumed by a local jurisdiction in 2008 for a school building that was no longer
being used for school purposes. In 2008 BPW approved the school closure and transfer to the
local jurisdiction, but we were advised that the State continued the debt payments and fully
satisfied the debt in 2011. State law requires that the State shall require reimbursement of
outstanding debt service for a school that is no longer being used for school purposes.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016
4) Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) (6/22/16 – 22 pages – 11 Findings)
 MSDE did not revert to the State’s General Fund $12.3 million it had received from the federal
government for the costs of central overhead services provided by other State agencies to
support MSDE’s federal grant activities for FYs 2012 to 2014. State law provides that funds
recovered from federal sources for statewide indirect costs must be reverted to the General
Fund and it prohibits granting any waiver or exemption to this requirement. MSDE did recover
and appropriately retain approximately $27 million of its own indirect costs during the
aforementioned period, but advised us that these amounts were insufficient for its needs.
 MSDE did not timely recover $10.4 million in federal funds for expenditures associated with one
federal grant, resulting in lost interest income totaling $140,000.
 MSDE improperly used interagency agreements with Towson University during November 2011
through June 2015 to staff its Chief Information Officer (CIO) position. Costs incurred by MSDE
totaled approximately $771,000, which MSDE estimates included University administrative fees
of $164,000. MSDE had an existing budgeted position for a CIO but did not believe the salary
was sufficient to obtain highly qualified applicants, so the interagency agreement was used to
procure the services of a CIO at enhanced salaries. During FY 2014, payments under the
agreements exceeded the budgeted salary and benefits by $58,000. In addition, the related
agreements lacked sufficient details to facilitate effective MSDE monitoring of deliverables.
 Tests of nine service contracts totaling $20.3 million found that bid evaluation documentation did
not always support the related awards, effective contract monitoring was not always
established, and bid solicitation periods were shorter than required by State regulations.
 MSDE did not adequately ensure that criminal background checks were obtained for all
individuals employed at child care facilities and that the results of the initial background checks
and any subsequent alerts were adequately pursued.
 MSDE did not restrict user access to the Child Care Subsidy Program features on the Child
Care Administration Tracking System to those individuals requiring access to perform their jobs
and to prevent the recording of improper transactions. Subsidies paid during FY 2014 using the
System totaled $81.5 million.
 Several conditions of inadequate security over MSDE’s information technology infrastructure
were identified. Contractors were provided unnecessary network level access to numerous
critical MSDE servers and workstations unrelated to projects they were assigned. Also,
appropriate safeguards were not established to protect sensitive personally identifiable
information of students and teachers maintained in two databases.
 Certain collections were not promptly endorsed and recorded and MSDE did not make timely
disclosures to appropriate legal authorities of certain questionable payroll and personnel activity
related to five employees.
