Background Information
Agency Responsibilities and Financial Information
The Office of the Register of Wills is a public office established under the
Constitution of Maryland. An office is established in each of the 24 Maryland
subdivisions. These offices oversee the administration of decedents’ estates
within their jurisdictions and provide assistance (such as providing the proper
forms) to individuals administering estates. The offices collect inheritance taxes
and other fees as provided by law.
Inheritance tax collections (less the commissions earned by an office on those
collections) are remitted to the State’s General Fund. The fees collected and
commissions earned by an office are first used to finance the operating expenses it
is responsible for paying directly. Generally, the remaining balance of fees and
commissions is periodically remitted to the Comptroller of Maryland to finance
other operating expenses (such as payroll) that the Comptroller pays on behalf of
the offices. On a collective basis, the offices’ fees and commissions that exceed
their operating expenses are credited to the General Fund.
According to the records of the Office of the Register of Wills for Carroll County,
its fiscal year 2013 gross receipts totaled $2,951,630, which consisted of
inheritance tax collections (net of commissions) of $2,038,538 and fees and
commissions of $913,092. The Office’s fiscal year 2013 operating expenses
totaled $513,684.
Findings and Recommendations
Collections
Finding 1
Deposit verifications were not performed by personnel independent of the
collection process.
Analysis
Deposit verifications were not performed by personnel independent of the
collection process. Specifically, the employee who performed the deposit
verifications also prepared the deposits and performed the bank reconciliations.
As a result, collections could potentially be misappropriated without detection.
The Comptroller of Maryland’s Accounting Procedures Manual requires that
recorded collections be reconciled to amounts deposited by an employee

independent of the collection process. During fiscal year 2013, the Office
processed collections totaling $2,951,630.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that an employee independent of the collection process
perform the deposit verification. We advised the Office on accomplishing the
necessary separation of duties using existing personnel.
Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have audited the Office of the Register of Wills for Carroll County, Maryland
for the period beginning March 2, 2011 and ending March 31, 2014. The audit
was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine the Office’s
financial transactions, records and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance
with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included cash receipts, cash disbursements, bank accounts,
and administration of estates. Our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, and observations of
the Office’s operations. We also tested transactions and performed other auditing
procedures that we considered necessary to achieve our objectives. The reliability
of data used in this report for background or informational purposes was not
assessed.
Our audit did not include a review of certain support services provided to the
Office by the Comptroller of Maryland – Office of the Comptroller. These
support services (such as payroll, maintenance of accounting records, and related
fiscal functions) are included within the scope of our audits of the Office of the
Comptroller.

The Office’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial
records, effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of
assets, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes a condition that we consider to be a significant deficiency in
the design or operation of internal control that could adversely affect the Office’s
ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate effectively and efficiently,
and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our audit did not
disclose any significant instances of noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or
regulations.
The Office’s response to our findings and recommendations is included as an
appendix to this report. As prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2-
1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we will advise the Office regarding the
results of our review of its response.
