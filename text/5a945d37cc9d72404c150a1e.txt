Members of Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee
Annapolis, Maryland
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We conducted an audit of the financial management practices of the Howard
County Public School System (HCPSS) in accordance with the requirements of
the State Government Article, Section 2-1220(e) of the Annotated Code of
Maryland. The objectives of this audit were to evaluate whether HCPSS’
procedures and controls were effective in accounting for and safeguarding its
assets and whether its policies provided for the efficient use of financial
resources.
Our audit disclosed that HCPSS’ procurement policies were not sufficiently
comprehensive and were not always consistently used when obtaining goods and
services under intergovernmental cooperative purchasing agreements. In
addition, our test of 10 contracts totaling $35.7 million disclosed that HCPSS did
not always publish the bids or awards on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage as
required by its policy and State law.
Our audit also disclosed that HCPSS needs to improve internal controls and
accountability in certain areas, including the processing of payments for
transportation and health care services. For example, HCPSS did not audit or
adequately monitor the performance of its third-party administrators that provide
health care claims processing services.
Furthermore, our audit disclosed certain risks in HCPSS’ information systems.
However in accordance with the State Government Article, Section 2-1224(i) of
the Annotated Code of Maryland, we have redacted these findings from this audit
report. Specifically, State law requires the Office of Legislative Audits to redact

--- Page 4 ---
cybersecurity findings in a manner consistent with auditing best practices before
the report is made available to the public. The term “cybersecurity” is defined in
the State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b), and using our
professional judgment we have determined that the redacted findings fall under
the referenced definition. The specifics of the cybersecurity findings were
previously communicated to HCPSS as well as those parties responsible for
acting on our recommendations.
Finally, based on our current audit assessment of significance and risk to our audit
objectives, our audit included a review to determine the status of 13 of the 15
findings contained in our preceding audit report. For the non-cybersecurity-
related findings, we determined that HCPSS satisfactorily addressed 6 of those 8
findings. The remaining 2 findings are repeated in this report.
HCPSS’ response to this audit is included as an appendix to this report. We
reviewed the response to our findings and related recommendations, and noted
agreement to our findings and recommendations. Subsequent to the response
receipt, but prior to the issuance of the final report, we contacted HCPSS staff
who provided verbal clarification that satisfactorily answered certain outstanding
questions and issues. In addition, there are several other aspects of HCPSS’
response for which we will need to obtain further clarification; however, we do
not anticipate that these will require the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee’s
attention to resolve. Consistent with the requirements of State law, we have
redacted the elements of HCPSS’ response related to cybersecurity audit findings.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the course of this
audit by HCPSS. We also wish to acknowledge HCPSS’ willingness to address
the audit issues and implement appropriate corrective actions.
Respectfully submitted,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Background Information
Statistical Overview
Enrollment
According to student enrollment records compiled by the Maryland State
Department of Education (MSDE), Howard County Public School System
(HCPSS) ranks 6th in student enrollment among the 24 public school systems in
Maryland. Fiscal year 2021 full-time student enrollment was 57,293 students.
HCPSS had 77 schools, consisting of 42 elementary, 20 middle schools, 12 high
schools, and 3 other types of schools (including special, alternative, and a career
academy).
Funding
HCPSS revenues consist primarily of funds received from Howard County, the
State, and the federal government. According to HCPSS’ audited financial
statements, revenues from all sources totaled approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal
year 2021; including approximately $376.7 million from the State. See Figure 1
below for HCPSS’ revenue sources per enrolled student in fiscal year 2021

Expenditures
According to HCPSS’ audited financial statements, fiscal year 2021 expenditures
were approximately $1.1 billion. The largest expenditure category was salaries
and wages, including benefits, which accounted for approximately 81 percent of
total expenditures during fiscal year 2021. According to MSDE records, during
the 2020-2021 school year, HCPSS had 8,322 full-time equivalent positions,
which consisted of 6,324 instructional and 1,998 non-instructional positions.
Instruction accounted for 60 percent of HCPSS’ expenditures on a categorical
basis (see Figure 2).

Oversight
HCPSS is governed by a local school board, consisting of seven elected voting
members and one voting student member. The student member has the same
rights and privileges as an elected member, and can vote on and participate in all
matters except those specifically prohibited by law, such as the discipline of staff,
appointment of the Superintendent, and the appointment and promotion of staff.
In accordance with State law, MSDE provides considerable oversight of HCPSS
through the establishment and monitoring of various financial and academic
6

--- Page 9 ---
policies and regulations. MSDE also works with HCPSS to comply with the
requirements and mandates of federal law. The Howard County government also
exercises authority over HCPSS primarily through the review and approval of
HCPSS’ annual operating and capital budgets.
External Audits
HCPSS engages a certified public accounting firm to independently audit its
annual financial statements. The firm performs procedures to verify the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The firm also evaluates the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management. In the related audit reports, the firm
stated that the financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of HCPSS as of June 30, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 and
the changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
For fiscal year 2019, the firm stated that the financial statements presented fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the government activities, the
business-type activities, and each major fund, other than the General Fund, and
the Aggregate Remaining Fund Information, and the changes in its financial
position and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the General
Fund and the Aggregate Remaining Fund Information (which includes the Health
and Dental Internal Services Fund), the firm expressed an adverse opinion1 since
the Health and Dental Internal Service Fund had not demonstrated its ability to
repay $20.7 million to the General Fund, which it owed as of June 30, 2019.
HCPSS personnel advised us that the deficit was mainly due to the intentional
underfunding of the projected actuarial benefit costs in fiscal years 2015 through
2018, which was approved by the Board. As recommended by the certified public
accounting firm, HCPSS put a plan in place in fiscal year 2020 to eliminate the
deficit by fiscal year 2022. See background comment for Management of Other
Risks section for additional detail.
Additionally, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, as part of the
audited financial statements the accounting firm also issued separate reports on
HCPSS’ control over financial reporting and its tests of HCPSS’ compliance with
1 According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, auditors express an adverse
opinion when the auditor, having obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence, concludes that
misstatements, individually or in the aggregate, are both material and pervasive to the financial
statements.

certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other
matters. These reports are an integral part of the annual independent audited
financial statements. In the reports as of June 30, 2019 and 2020 the firm noted
various material weaknesses (such as, revenue recognition, year-end closeout, and
internal service fund accounting for the Health and Dental Fund). Additionally, in
the report as of June 30, 2018 the firm noted a significant deficiency, which is a
less severe condition than a material weakness (that is, overdue accounts
receivable balances in the restricted programs fund). HCPSS corrected these
deficiencies and no material weaknesses were disclosed in the report as of June
30, 2021.
The accounting firm also conducts the Single Audit of HCPSS’ federal grant
programs. The Single Audit is intended to provide assurance to the federal
government that adequate internal controls are in place, and the entity is generally
in compliance with program requirements. For the Single Audits as of June 30,
2016 and 2017 the firm noted instances of noncompliance that it deemed either a
material weakness or a significant deficiency (the subsequent reports for years
2018 to 2020 did not contain such findings). For example, for 2017 HCPSS
omitted three grant awards totaling $8.2 million from the federal expenditure
schedule. In addition, HCPSS lacked proper review of financial reports, did not
provide time and effort certifications, and charged expenditures to grants that
were unallowable, were not properly recorded, and were outside of the grant
period. HCPSS corrected these deficiencies and they were not repeated in
subsequent years.
We reviewed the aforementioned financial statement audits for fiscal years 2016
through 2021 and examined the related work papers for the fiscal year 2021 audit.
We also reviewed the Single Audit reports for fiscal years 2016 through 2020, and
examined the related work papers for the fiscal year 2020 Single Audit, which
was the latest available during our audit fieldwork. Certain work of the
independent certified public accounting firm, which we determined was reliable,
covered areas included in the scope of our audit. As a result, we did not conduct
any audit work related to the following areas:
 State and local government revenues received via wire transfer
 Accounts receivables
 Federal grant activity
The independent accounting firm did not disclose any material deficiencies in
these areas, other than those for federal grants mentioned above.

Prior Superintendent Separation and Release Agreement
In order to resolve matters in dispute between the Board and the prior
Superintendent, the Board accepted the prior Superintendent’s application for
retirement, effective May 2, 2017. The parties executed an agreement, where the
prior Superintendent would receive payments totaling approximately $1.6 million
over a four-year period ending in fiscal year 2020 including contributions of
$449,000 to State pension and deferred compensation plans, and $65,000 for
unused leave.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Based on our current assessment of significance and risk relative to our audit
objectives, our audit included a review to determine the status of 13 of the 15
findings contained in our preceding audit report dated October 17, 2016. As
disclosed in Figure 3, for the non-cybersecurity-related findings, we determined
that HCPSS satisfactorily addressed 6 of those 8 findings. The remaining 2 non-
cybersecurity-related findings are repeated in this report.

Findings and Recommendations
Revenue and Billing Cycle
Background
Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) revenues consist primarily of
funds received from Howard County, the State, and the federal government.
According to HCPSS’ audited financial statements, revenues from all sources
totaled approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2021; including approximately
$376.7 million from the State.
External Audits
There were similarities between the work of the independent certified public
accounting firm that audited HCPSS’ financial statements and the objectives of
our audit for certain revenue activities. As a result, we relied on this work to
provide audit coverage for State and local government revenues received via wire
transfer and accounts receivable, for which the auditor’s most recent procedural
review (related to the fiscal year 2021 audit) and testing disclosed no material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies.
School Activity Funds
Schools collect funds for other purposes such as student activities, clubs, and
school publications. Because they are not considered school revenue, these
school activity funds are accounted for separately by each school, and reported in
summary in the audited financial statements. According to HCPSS management,
due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, school activity fund collections
during fiscal year 2021 ($2.9 million) were $9.7 million less than fiscal year 2019
collections. The fund balance at June 30, 2021 was $4.8 million.
HCPSS’ Board of Education (the Board) has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure
that school activity funds were used only for intended purposes. HCPSS contracts
with an independent certified public accountant (CPA) to conduct limited reviews
of school activity funds on a rotating basis. These reviews consist primarily of
analytical reviews and testing receipt transactions at selected schools (four high
schools for fiscal year 2021). The CPA’s review did not disclose any issues.
In addition, in accordance with HCPSS’ policy, “school activity funds will be
audited pursuant to the internal audit plan approved by the Board”. During fiscal
years 2016 to 2021, the internal auditor performed reviews of 29 of the 77
schools. The reviews consisted of evaluating and testing compliance with
HCPSS' policies, regulations, and procedures in accordance with the Manual of
Policies & Procedures for School Activity Funds. The Manual establishes
11

--- Page 14 ---
standard procedures for all schools to follow to ensure school activity funds are
adequately safeguarded and accounted for in a uniform manner. The results of the
reviews were provided to the respective school’s principal and HCPSS
management. Our review of the internal auditor’s findings for fiscal years 2019
to 2020 disclosed that they generally found the management of these funds to be
adequate and that any control weaknesses identified were not prevalent. The
internal audit reports reviewed did not identify any improprieties regarding the
misuse of funds.
Conclusion
Based on our current assessment of significance and risk relative to our audit
objectives, we relied on the work of the CPA and HCPSS internal auditor to
provide audit coverage in this area, including procedures and controls related to
the accounting for and safeguarding of cash receipts with respect to revenue and
billing.
Federal Funds
Background
HCPSS receives funds pertaining to federal government programs that are
generally restricted for use for a specific program (such as the School Lunch
Program or Special Education). According to HCPSS’ Single Audit for fiscal
year 2020 (latest available at the time of our audit) federal expenditures totaled
$32.8 million, not including federally funded fee-for-service programs such as
Medicaid reimbursement for special education services.
According to the audited financial statements, federal fund revenues increased,
from $30.5 million in fiscal year 2019 to $43.9 million in fiscal year 2021 (44
percent), due to COVID-19 pandemic grant funding. Specifically, according to
HCPSS’ records, as of December 31, 2021, HCPSS was awarded federal COVID-
19 pandemic grant funds totaling $86.1 million to be distributed over federal
fiscal years 2020 to 2024 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security Act, Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act,
and American Recovery Plan Act.4 As of the same date, HCPSS had made
expenditures related to these COVID-19 grants totaling $19.1 million, which were
primarily comprised of laptops, staffing, personal protection equipment, and
4 In addition to the federal grants, HCPSS was also awarded eight State and local COVID-19
grants totaling $14.6 million, of which $6.6 million had been spent as of December 31, 2021.
For example, HCPSS received a County – CARES award of $5.6 million and an MSDE
Supplemental Instruction and Tutoring award of $5.6 million. State and local grants are subject
to review and testing during our audit.
12

--- Page 15 ---
sanitary supplies. HCPSS has policies and procedures to ensure federal grant
funds are properly monitored and accounted for to ensure the funds are used to the
fullest extent possible. In addition, reports of grant fund activity are presented
monthly to the Board. HCPSS initially funded the expenditures with State and
local funds and intends to pursue reimbursement from the aforementioned
programs to the extent allowed.
Single Audit Reports Disclosed No Reportable Conditions Regarding Federal
Grant Management for the Most Recent Three Years
There were similarities in the work performed by the independent certified public
accounting firm that conducted the Single Audit of HCPSS’ federal grants and the
objectives of our audit in this area. In addition to expressing an opinion on
HCPSS compliance with the terms of several grant programs, the auditor also
considered the existing internal control structure’s impact on compliance and
audited the required Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (which includes
claimed and reported grant expenditures) for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. The
aforementioned Single Audits conducted through fiscal year 2020 did not include
COVID-19 grant funds.
The related reports stated that HCPSS complied, in all material respects, with the
requirements applicable to its major federal programs for fiscal years 2018 to
2020. With respect to internal controls over compliance with, and the operation
of, major federal programs, the auditors did not identify any material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies for fiscal years 2018 to 2020. However, for fiscal year
2017, the auditors identified nine significant deficiencies with one considered to
be a material weakness (detailed previously above), and for fiscal year 2016, the
auditors identified one significant deficiency that was not considered a material
weakness. These deficiencies were indicated as being resolved in the subsequent
fiscal years' report.
Medicaid Funds for Eligible Services
HCPSS has established a procedure to identify children eligible for Medicaid-
subsidized services and the services rendered. Medicaid is an entitlement
program for which certain service costs can be reimbursed to HCPSS. Medicaid
activity is not covered by the Single Audit of federal grants.
The Maryland State Department of Education’s Interagency Medicaid Monitoring
Team issued a report in October 2021 of the results of its review of 66 student
case files for 75 criteria (including the correct billing of Medicaid for eligible
services). The report found that HCPSS was generally compliant with most
criteria. For example, HCPSS was 100 percent compliant with 55 criteria, and
between 89 and 99 percent compliant with 15 criteria.
13

--- Page 16 ---
According to HCPSS records, fiscal year 2021 State and federal reimbursements
for Medicaid-subsidized services totaled approximately $1.6 million, which was
26 percent lower than the previous year. We were advised by HCPSS that this
decrease was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic health crisis, as
certain services either could not be provided or did not qualify for reimbursement
in a virtual environment.
Conclusion
Based on our current assessment of significance and risk relative to our audit
objectives, our audit did not include a review of Medicaid-subsidized services.
Furthermore, we relied on the work of the independent certified public accounting
firm that conducted the Single Audits for all other work in this area, including
policies, procedures, and controls with respect to federal grants and expenditures.
Procurement and Disbursement Cycle
Background
According to the audited financial statements and HCPSS’ records, disbursements
(excluding payroll) totaled $211.4 million during fiscal year 2021. HCPSS uses a
financial management system for purchases and disbursements. Requisitions are
created in the system by departments and are subject to on-line departmental
approvals. Purchase orders are prepared in the system by the purchasing
department based on approved requisitions. The purchasing department also
generally handles the solicitation, bid evaluation, and establishment of contracts.
Invoices are submitted by vendors directly to the accounts payable department for
entry into the financial management system. The system matches invoices to
appropriate purchasing documents and the verification of receipt entered by the
receiving school or department. The system then prints vendor checks or
processes an electronic payment and posts the payment to the financial records.
HCPSS written procurement policies require that procurements exceeding
$25,000 be competitively bid in accordance with Section 5-112 of the Education
Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Contracts and agreements exceeding
$25,000 that HCPSS procures are to be approved by the Board.
14

Finding 1
Certain requirements of State law and recognized best practices were not
incorporated into HCPSS policies and/or were not consistently used when
participating in intergovernmental cooperative purchasing agreements
(ICPA).
Analysis
Certain requirements of State law and recognized best practices were not
incorporated into HCPSS policies and/or were not consistently used by HCPSS
when participating in an ICPA. State law, which legal counsel to the Maryland
General Assembly advised us is applicable to local education agencies, allows the
use of ICPAs only after the using entity has determined (or assessed) in writing
that the use of such arrangements will provide cost benefits, promote
administrative efficiencies, or promote intergovernmental cooperation.5
Our review of HCPSS procurement policies disclosed that the following statutory
requirement and critical best practices were not included.
 Prepare a written assessment of the benefits of using an ICPA as required by
State law
 Analyze all costs of conducting competitive solicitations
 Research, compare, and evaluate available ICPAs
 Verify ICPA has a clause allowing utilization by other parties
 Verify terms, scope of services, specifications, and price meet our needs
 Execute an addendum of participation with lead agency and remove or
incorporate necessary local terms and conditions
 Obtain a copy of the ICPA and related price lists for invoice verification
In addition, we tested HCPSS’ participation in three ICPAs (selected based on
significance) during fiscal years 2018 and 2020, with contract awards totaling
approximately $8.5 million. Our review disclosed that HCPSS did not have a
written assessment of the benefits of using two of the ICPAs tested totaling $6
million, as required by State law. In addition, two of the six best practices not
5 Section 13-110 of the State Finance and Procurement Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, in part, defines an ICPA as a contract that is entered into by at least one governmental
entity in a certain manner, that is available for use by the governmental entity entering the
contract and at least one additional governmental entity, and that is intended to promote
efficiency and savings that can result from intergovernmental cooperative purchasing. The
aforementioned law applies to all ICPAs regardless of the services, goods, or commodities
purchased. In addition, Section 5-112(a)(3) of the Education Article of the Code, provides that
local education agencies do not need to conduct competitive procurements for goods and
commodities if they use a contract awarded by public agencies or intergovernmental purchasing
organizations and the originating procuring agency followed public bidding procedures.

included in HCPSS policy (analyzing the costs of conducting competitive
solicitations and researching, comparing, and evaluating other available ICPAs)
were not performed for the three ICPAs tested. One best practice that was
included in HCPSS policy (ensure the ICPA is competitively bid and competitive
bid documentation be obtained) was not complied with for the three ICPAs tested.
We did find that other best practices were performed despite not being included in
HCPSS’ policies. For example, HCPSS verified that the ICPA had a clause
allowing utilization by other parties, had executed an addendum of participation
with the lead contract for two of the three ICPAs we reviewed, and obtained a
copy of the ICPA and related price lists for invoice verification for all three
ICPAs we reviewed. Incorporating ICPA best practices into HCPSS procurement
policies could help ensure they are consistently used.
The Institute for Public Procurement, formerly known as the National Institute of
Government Purchasing, as well as other public and educational organizations
have published ICPA best practices. These practices include comprehensive
multi-step checklists that require, among other things (as per the list above), that
prospective ICPA users verify that the contract allows other entities to participate.
In addition, ICPA users should ensure that the contract was awarded through a
competitive procurement process, and requires that addendums be executed
documenting their participation and incorporating local required terms and
conditions.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that HCPSS incorporate the aforementioned statutory
requirement and other identified and acknowledged best practices into its
procurement policies, and ensure that the performance of the requirement
and best practices are documented when evaluating and participating in
ICPAs.
Finding 2
Contract bids and awards were not always published on eMaryland
Marketplace Advantage as required by HCPSS policy and applicable State
law.
Analysis
Contract bids and awards were not always published on eMaryland Marketplace
Advantage (eMMA) as required by HCPSS policy and applicable State law. Our
test of 10 contracts totaling $35.7 million disclosed that HCPSS did not use
eMMA to publish contract bids or awards for 4 contracts totaling $18.7 million.
16

--- Page 19 ---
HCPSS procurement procedures and State law requires a local school system to
publish a procurement solicitation or notice of award greater than $50,000 on
eMMA.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that HCPSS comply with its procurement procedures and
State procurement law by using eMMA to publish contract bids and awards.
Human Resources and Payroll
Background
Payroll expense represents the largest single cost component in the HCPSS
budget. According to HCPSS’ records, fiscal year 2021 salary, wage, and benefit
costs totaled approximately $878.2 million, representing 81 percent of the total
expenditures. According to Maryland State Department of Education reports,
during the 2020-2021 school year HCPSS had 8,322 full-time positions, which
consisted of 6,324 instructional and 1,998 non-instructional positions.
HCPSS uses automated systems to maintain human resources information, record
employee time, track employee leave usage, and process and record payroll
transactions. The system generates payroll checks and direct deposit advices.
Payroll processing involves both automated processes (such as compiling leave
and running edit reports) and manual processes (such as data entry of new
employee information).
Conclusion
Our audit did not disclose any significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of HCPSS’ internal control over the human resources and payroll areas of
operations reviewed. Our audit also did not disclose any significant instances of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
Equipment Control and Accountability
Background
According to HCPSS’ audited financial statements, the undepreciated value of its
capital equipment inventory was $38.8 million as of June 30, 2021. HCPSS
maintains centralized automated records for equipment with a cost of $5,000 or
more (including assets capitalized for financial statement purposes). In addition,
HCPSS' Department of Informational Technology maintains inventory records of
all sensitive items that are susceptible to theft such as laptops and small items
17

--- Page 20 ---
(cameras, portable tools) with a cost of $500 or more, which are assigned to
schools, students, and employees. HCPSS has established comprehensive written
equipment policies and performs inventories at each school every three years.
Conclusion
Based on our current assessment of significance and risk relative to our audit
objectives, our audit did not include a review of policies, procedures, and controls
with respect to the equipment area of operations.
Information Technology
We determined that the Information Technology section, including Findings 3
through 5 related to “cybersecurity”, as defined by the State Finance and
Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b) of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and
therefore are subject to redaction from the publicly available report in accordance
with the State Government Article, Section 2-1224(i). Consequently, the
specifics of the following findings, including the analysis, related
recommendations, along with HCPSS’ responses, have been redacted from this
report copy.
Finding 3
Redacted cybersecurity-related finding.
Finding 4
Redacted cybersecurity-related finding.
Finding 5
Redacted cybersecurity-related finding.
Facilities Construction, Renovation, and Maintenance
Background
HCPSS employs a staff of 579 employees to maintain its 77 schools (including
career academy, alternative education, and special education centers) and a
number of other facilities (such as administrative and support offices). According
to its fiscal year 2021 Capital Improvement Plan, necessary construction, major
18

--- Page 21 ---
renovations, and systemic improvements to HCPSS’ facilities over the next five
years are estimated to cost approximately $386.2 million.
Processes are in Place to Promote Ongoing Facility Maintenance and to
Minimize Energy Costs
HCPSS has processes in place to promote ongoing facility maintenance and
minimize energy costs. For example, HCPSS provides preventive maintenance of
its buildings and equipment with the goal of preventing emergency repairs. In
addition, HCPSS participates in a consortium with other Baltimore-area entities to
purchase energy at the best possible terms for members of the consortium.
HCPSS also utilizes a vendor energy management program to monitor and control
heating and air conditioning usage and a utility billing management system to
monitor related costs. HCPSS has written policies that include best practices that
encourage both students and employees to be aware of and limit their energy use
and requires internal on-site reviews of building energy efficiency. Further,
HCPSS makes limited use of solar and geothermal alternative energy sources.
According to consortium reports (which we did not audit), HCPSS saved
approximately $8.2 million through energy cost avoidance from fiscal years 2007
to 2021.
Conclusion
Our audit did not disclose any significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of HCPSS’ internal control over the facilities maintenance, energy management
and construction areas of operations reviewed. Our audit also did not disclose any
significant instances of noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
Transportation Services
Background
According to statistics compiled by the Maryland State Department of Education,
HCPSS has approximately 44,300 students eligible to receive student
transportation services. These students were transported using 474 contractor-
owned buses. HCPSS reported that 5.4 million route miles were traveled to
transport students for the 2018-2019 school year and 3.7 million route miles for
the 2019-2020 school year. The decline in route miles was attributed to students
not requiring transportation during virtual learning as a result of COVID-19.
HCPSS uses a bidding process to award routes to contractors based on the lowest
competitive bid. Prospective bidders submit proposals that specify several cost
components (hourly rate per mile and time, extended hourly rates per mile and
time). HCPSS calculates the lowest bid for the yearly total, based on a standard
19

--- Page 22 ---
number of hours and miles contained in the request for bids. HCPSS uses an
automated bus contractor payment system to calculate monthly payments that are
to be based on the contractor bid and actual mileage and driver time. According
to HCPSS’ financial records, fiscal year 2021 transportation costs totaled $30.6
million, including $26.8 million paid to 30 bus contractors. When schools were
closed between March 17, 2020 to February 28, 2021, due to the COVID-19
pandemic, HCPSS paid the bus contractors 75 percent of their minimum
guarantees as stated in the contracts.
Consultant Recommendations for Student Transportation
Due to its concerns about bus driver shortages, in June 2021, HCPSS hired a
transportation consultant to analyze the efficiency of its use of school buses. The
consultant’s work included three tasks 1) baseline analysis and options
development; 2) identification of constraints and variables; and 3) communication
of options, and the determination and finalization of results. In February 2022,
the consultant issued a report which recommended changes to student
transportation including determining school-by-school bell [start and stop] times,
establishing revised bus routes, and ensure community outreach efforts. The
target for implementation was the 2022-2023 school year. HCPSS subsequently
decided to hire the consultant again to review the structure of transportation
contracts and/or in-house operation of buses. A report was issued in June 2022
that recommended several actions including that HCPSS switch to a hybrid
service model starting in fiscal year 2024. The Board reviewed and approved
both aforementioned reports and agreed to implement the recommendations.
Finding 6
Bus vendor payment information was not independently reviewed prior to
payment.
Analysis
Bus vendor payment information was not independently reviewed prior to
payment. A Transportation Office employee manually enters payment
information (such as time and mileage) into the bus payment system, which is
forwarded to the Finance Office in summary format for final processing and
disbursement to the 30 transportation vendors. Although we were advised that a
transportation department supervisor reviewed the payment information entered
by the aforementioned employee, the review was not documented and the
supervisor was not independent since the supervisor could also enter payment
information on the system.
According to HCPSS’ financial records, payments to bus contractors totaled $26.8
million in fiscal year 2021. A similar condition was commented upon in our two
20

--- Page 23 ---
preceding audit reports dating back to October 23, 2009. In response to our prior
report, HCPSS disagreed with our finding and recommendation since it believed a
sufficient review was being performed, including a post-payment automated
flagging of unusually large payments which were compared to budgeted
expenditures. Therefore, HCPSS did not implement our prior recommendation to
independently review the bus contractor payment information prior to payment.
Since annual payments to bus contractors are in excess of $26 million, we
continue to believe HCPSS should perform an independent documented review of
payment information prior to payment.
Recommendation 6
We recommend that HCPSS ensure that an independent documented review
of payment information is performed by Transportation Office supervisory
personnel before transmission to the Finance Office for processing (repeat).
We determined that Finding 7 related to “cybersecurity”, as defined by the State
Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b) of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, and therefore is subject to redaction from the publicly available report
in accordance with the State Government Article, Section 2-1224(i).
Consequently, the specifics of the following finding, including the analysis,
related recommendations, along with HCPSS’ responses, have been redacted from
this report copy.
Finding 7
Redacted cybersecurity-related finding.
Food Services
Background
According to HCPSS’ audited financial statements, food services operating
expenditures totaled $15 million in fiscal year 2021, and were primarily funded
with federal funds totaling $16.3 million and food sales totaling $331,000.
According to MSDE records, in fiscal year 2021 HCPSS had 172 food services
positions for its 77 schools, consisting of 169 cafeteria positions and 3
administrative positions.
Similar to other Maryland Local Education Agencies, HCPSS continued to serve
meals from certain schools during the COVID-19 pandemic health crisis by
providing free meals for parents and students to pick up. The number of meals
increased by 4 percent from 5.2 million in fiscal year 2019 to 5.4 million in fiscal
21

--- Page 24 ---
year 2021. HCPSS’ food service expenditures declined by 10 percent (food costs
and equipment) during the same period, from $16.6 million to $15 million.
HCPSS indicated that although no employees were laid off due to the COVID-19
pandemic, it is 20 percent understaffed due to vacancies.
Conclusion
Based on our current assessment of significance and risk relative to our audit
objectives, our audit did not include a review of policies, procedures, and controls
related to the Food Services financial area of operations.
School Board Oversight
Background
The Howard County Board of Education (the Board) is composed of seven
elected members and one voting student member who has the same rights and
privileges except for certain matters (such as the suspension or dismissal of
teachers, principals, and other professional personnel). The Board contracted
with a certified public accounting firm to conduct independent audits of the
HCPSS financial statements and federal programs. To assist in its oversight of
various areas of HCPSS operations and governance, the Board established several
committees, such as Audit, Legislative, Policy, and Budget Review. Additionally,
the Board has established a community advisory committee, which meets monthly
in an open forum to hear public concerns.
HCPSS Adopted an Ethics Policy that Met the Requirements of State Law
The Board has adopted a detailed ethics policy that conforms to State Law and
was approved by the State Ethics Commission. The policy is applicable to both
Board members and HCPSS employees and includes provisions for conflicts of
interest and financial disclosures by Board members and certain employees.
Specifically, annual financial disclosure statements are required to be filed by
Board members, candidates for the Board, the Superintendent, and other
administrators (such as supervisors, school principals, and agency buyers) by
April 30th of each year.
In accordance with the policy, HCPSS established an Ethics Panel consisting of
five members appointed by the Board to interpret ethics policies and provide
advice on policy implementation. The Panel also reviews and rules on any
reported complaints of ethics violations. Our review of the records for Board
members and HCPSS employees required to submit financial disclosure forms for
calendar year 2020 disclosed that all forms were submitted as required.
22

--- Page 25 ---
Conclusion
Our audit did not disclose any reportable conditions related to school board
oversight.
Management of Other Risks
Healthcare Background
HCPSS is self-insured and contracts with five third-party administrator firms
(TPAs) for health care claims processing services6 for employee and retiree
medical, prescription, dental, and vision costs. HCPSS also contracts with a
consultant to help manage the health plans. The consultant performs data analysis
of health services utilization and costs, provides recommendations on potential
rate changes, and evaluates the merits of health plan proposals.
The health benefit plans for HCPSS employees and retirees are financed through a
separate internal service fund (referred to as the Health and Dental Fund) and
provides plan coverage under contracts with several insurance companies and
health maintenance organizations.

Health and Dental Fund Deficit and Elimination Plan
HCPSS began incurring a negative fund balance in its Health and Dental Fund in
fiscal year 2016 totaling $16.5 million which grew to $39.2 million by the end of
fiscal year 2019. HCPSS stated on its website that the deficit was mainly due to
the intentional underfunding of the projected actuarial benefits costs in fiscal
years 2015 through 2018. The underfunding was approved by the Board and the
funds were allocated for other operating budget priorities. For example, in fiscal
year 2017 the budgeted actuarial benefit costs were estimated to be $122 million,
but HCPSS budgeted funding totaling $100.6 million.
In December 2017, HCPSS engaged an independent consultant to perform a
forensic review of the Health and Dental Fund to review the deficit and
recommend corrective actions. The consultant issued a report in March 2019,
which concluded that it did not identify indications of fraud or misconduct, but
provided several recommendations to improve internal controls over invoice
processing and approvals. For example, the consultant’s test of 420 transactions
disclosed that 97 transactions did not have supporting documentation.
In fiscal year 2019, HCPSS made the decision to stop growing the deficit and the
County provided $11.1 million appropriation to reduce the deficit amount. As
recommended by the consultant, HCPSS put a plan in place starting in fiscal year
2020 in order to eliminate the deficit by fiscal year 2022 by reducing costs, where
possible, and ensuring that the anticipated health plan costs would be fully funded
in the budgets. The plan also included receiving an additional $13 million in
funding from Howard County. This plan reduced the deficit to $9.7 million by
the end of fiscal year 2021, and according to HCPSS records, which had not yet
been audited at the time of our fieldwork, HCPSS anticipates a positive fund
balance as of June 30, 2022 of $1.6 million.
In January 2020, Howard County engaged an independent consultant to perform
agreed upon procedures that, in-part, included a comprehensive analysis
comparing HCPSS to peer jurisdictions based on program design, benefits, cost
details, and costs sharing arrangements. The consultant issued its report in
October 2020 and concluded that HCPSS’ employees had the lowest cost of
health services while having the highest claim cost per employee. The consultant
recommended that HCPSS consider having a claims audit performed of the TPAs
to help identify possible irregularities in claim payments. The consultant also
recommended that HCPSS consider conducting further research to determine the
reason for the comparatively high cost per employee. However, as of July 2022,
no formal research of employee health care costs had been performed.

Finding 8
HCPSS did not audit or adequately monitor the performance of its third-
party administrators that provide health care claims processing services.
Analysis
HCPSS did not audit or adequately monitor the performance of its third-party
administrators (TPAs) that provide health care claims processing services.
Specifically, although HCPSS verified the propriety of administrative fees, it did
not verify the propriety of TPA billings for employee and retiree health care
claims, and the receipt of prescription drug rebates. Additionally, HCPSS did not
perform audits of TPA performance measures.
 HCPSS did not obtain and review claim data to support the amounts billed by
the five TPAs for health care claims. Rather, HCPSS was provided with a
schedule of the total claims paid for each health plan. HCPSS approved the
claim payments based on a review of the summary data with no review of
supporting documentation.
 Although HCPSS tracked the receipt of prescription drug rebates and
compared it to budgeted amounts, it did not audit the pharmacy TPA to ensure
that it received all the prescription drug rebates the TPA received from drug
manufacturers. Drug rebates are determined based on volume and type of
drug dispensed per agreements with drug manufacturers.
 HCPSS did not routinely audit health care claims paid by the TPAs, as
recommended by its consultant, to ensure that the billed services were
provided to participants, were covered by the health plans, and that amounts
paid were proper. We were advised by HCPSS that it was unaware of when
or if a claims audit had been performed. HCPSS’ TPA contracts allowed for
periodic independent third-party audits of the accuracy and validity of claim
reimbursements paid by HCPSS.
A similar condition was commented upon in our two preceding audit reports
dating back to October 23, 2009. In response to our prior report, HCPSS
disagreed with our finding and recommendation since it believed a sufficient
verification was being performed (such as, dependent eligibility verification
and automated controls to prevent improper claims payments) and it believed
claims audits were not cost effective. Therefore, HCPSS did not implement
our prior recommendation to establish procedures to verify the amounts paid
for health insurance. Since annual claims payments are in excess of $150
million, and the March 2019 consultant’s report highlighted significant
problems with claim documentation, we continue to believe that claims
25

--- Page 28 ---
audits are a reasonable approach for detecting health care billing errors and
for ensuring claim payments are for allowable benefits for eligible
participants.
 HCPSS did not audit, or otherwise verify, the accuracy of the five TPAs’
self-reported compliance with performance measures. For example, the
largest TPA contract included 10 performance measures relating to account
management, claim administration, plan sponsor services, and member
services. Additionally, the contract allowed for the assessment of penalties
(up to $2.2 million annually) if the TPA did not meet the performance
measures. Although the two primary medical TPAs reported self-assessed
penalties of $51,000 in calendar years 2017 through 2021 based on their
reported compliance, HCPSS did not have a process in place to verify the
TPA’s reported compliance even though the contract allows for an
independent audit of the performance measures.
Recommendation 8
We recommend that HCPSS
a. establish procedures to independently verify the propriety of TPA
billings;
b. conduct pharmacy TPA audits to assess that all drug rebates due were
received;
c. conduct claims audits to assess the accuracy and validity of claim
reimbursements made by the TPAs (repeat); and
d. establish a process to independently verify, on an annual basis, the TPAs’
compliance with reported performance measures and assess penalties
when performance goals are not met.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a performance audit of the Howard County Public School
System (HCPSS). We conducted this audit under the authority of the State
Government Article, Section 2-1220(e) of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
which generally requires that every 6 years we audit each of the 24 local school
systems to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial management
practices. This performance audit was performed it in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
We had two broad audit objectives:
1. Evaluate whether the HCPSS procedures and controls were effective in
accounting for and safeguarding its assets.
2. Evaluate whether the HCPSS policies provided for the efficient use of
financial resources.
In planning and conducting our audit of HCPSS, we focused on 11 major
financial-related areas of operations as approved on December 6, 2016 by the
Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee of the Maryland General Assembly in
accordance with the enabling legislation. The scope of the work performed in
each of these areas was based on our assessments of significance and risk.
Therefore, our follow-up on the status of findings included in our preceding audit
report on HCPSS dated October 17, 2016, was limited to those findings that were
applicable to the current audit scope for each of the 11 areas.
The audit objectives excluded reviewing and assessing student achievement,
curriculum, teacher performance, and other academic-related areas and functions.
Also, we did not evaluate the HCPSS Comprehensive Education Master Plan or
related updates, and we did not review the activities, financial or other, of any
parent teacher association, group, or funds not under the local board of
education’s direct control or management.
To accomplish our objectives, we reviewed applicable State laws and regulations
pertaining to public elementary and secondary education, as well as policies and
procedures issued and established by HCPSS. We also interviewed personnel at
HCPSS and the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), and staff at
27

--- Page 30 ---
other local school systems in Maryland (as appropriate). Our audit procedures
included inspections of documents and records, and to the extent practicable,
observations of HCPSS operations. We also tested transactions and performed
other auditing procedures that we considered necessary to achieve our objectives,
generally for the period from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022.
Generally, transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgment,
which primarily considers risk, the timing or dollar amount of the transaction, or
the significance of the transaction to the area of operation reviewed. As a matter
of course, we do not normally use sampling in our tests, so unless otherwise
specifically indicated, neither statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was
used to select the transactions tested. Therefore, unless sampling is specifically
indicated in a finding, the results from any tests conducted or disclosed by us
cannot be used to project those results to the entire population from which the test
items were selected. For certain areas within the scope of the audit, we relied on
the work performed by the independent accounting firm that annually audits
HCPSS’ financial statements and conducts the federal Single Audit, as well as the
reviews of student activity funds performed by HCPSS’ Internal Audit
Department.
We used certain statistical data—including financial and operational—compiled
by MSDE from various informational reports submitted by the Maryland local
school systems. This information was used in this audit report for background or
informational purposes, and was deemed reasonable.
We also extracted data from the HCPSS automated financial management system
for the purpose of testing expenditure and payroll transactions. We performed
various audit procedures on the relevant data and determined the data were
sufficiently reliable for the purposes the data were used during the audit.
HCPSS’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records;
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets; and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved. As
provided in Government Auditing Standards, there are five components of
internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities,
information and communication, and monitoring. Each of the five components,
when significant to the audit objectives, and as applicable to HCPSS, were
considered by us during the course of this audit.
28

--- Page 31 ---
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. In addition
to the conditions included in this report, other findings were communicated to
HCPSS that were not deemed significant and, consequently, did not warrant
inclusion in this report.
State Government Article Section 2-1224(i) requires that we redact in a manner
consistent with auditing best practices any cybersecurity findings before a report
is made available to the public. This results in the issuance of two different
versions of an audit report that contains cybersecurity findings – a redacted
version for the public and an unredacted version for government officials
responsible for acting on our audit recommendations.
The State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b), states that
cybersecurity is defined as “processes or capabilities wherein systems,
communications, and information are protected and defended against damage,
unauthorized use or modification, and exploitation”. Based on that definition, and
in our professional judgment, we concluded that certain findings in this report fall
under that definition. Consequently, for the publicly available audit report all
specifics as to the nature of cybersecurity findings and required corrective actions
have been redacted. We have determined that such aforementioned practices, and
government auditing standards, support the redaction of this information from the
public audit report. The specifics of these cybersecurity findings have been
communicated to HCPSS and those parties responsible for acting on our
recommendations in an unredacted audit report.
We conducted our fieldwork from October 2021 to July 2022. HCPSS’ response
to our findings and recommendations is included as an appendix to this report.
Depending on the version of the audit report, responses to any cybersecurity
findings may be redacted in accordance with State law. As prescribed in the State
Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we will
advise HCPSS regarding the results of our review of its response.
