Re: Audit of Maryland Department of Health
Developmental Disabilities Administration
Report Date: October 26, 2022
The Honorable Laura Herrera Scott, M.D., Secretary
Maryland Department of Health
201 West Preston Street
Baltimore, Maryland 21201
Dear Secretary Herrera Scott:
Our October 26, 2022 audit report of the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) –
Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) determined that DDA’s accountability and
compliance level was unsatisfactory, based on our rating system. The rating system was
established, in accordance with State Government Article, Section 2-1221, of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, for the purpose of determining an overall evaluation of an agency’s fiscal
accountability and compliance with State laws and regulations. In accordance with a policy
approved by the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, the Office of Legislative Audits (OLA)
performs a follow-up review of the status of the findings contained in any audit report that is
rated unsatisfactory.
To that end, initially in April 2023 we requested an implementation status from MDH for
the findings included in the report in conjunction with the aforementioned policy. In response to
our request, MDH on behalf of DDA, provided a status report, as of April 3, 2023, which
indicated that MDH did not expect any of the seven non-cybersecurity-related findings to be
fully resolved until October 1, 2023. We have redacted the current status of one cybersecurity
finding from this letter, in compliance with the requirements of the State Government Article
Section 2-1224(i), of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Accordingly, OLA concluded that
conducting a follow-up review at that time would not be effective or an efficient use of our
resources, and that the follow-up would be deferred to a later date consistent with the MDH
expected implementation date of October 2023.

The Honorable Laura Herrera Scott, M.D., -2- February 9, 2024
Secretary
Consequently, in a January 11, 2024 letter, OLA requested that MDH provide an updated
status report of all findings contained in the October 26, 2022 DDA audit report, as of December
31, 2023. In response to OLA’s request, on January 31, 2024, MDH provided a status report
which indicated that the majority of the DDA audit report findings still had not been
substantially corrected and that these recommendations would be implemented in calendar year
2024.
Based upon the self-reported lack of substantial progress in addressing the prior report
findings and the proximity to our next audit of DDA, which is scheduled to commence during
the second quarter of calendar year 2024, OLA has concluded that it would not be an effective
and efficient use of our resources to perform the formal follow-up review. As such, we will
review the actions taken with respect to the recommendations in the prior audit report in our
upcoming audit of DDA.
Sincerely,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor
