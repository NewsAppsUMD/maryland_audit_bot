Key Findings – Internal Controls
Cash Receipts - (p.9)
(cid:131) Schools did not retain detail records for student
activity funds to sufficiently substantiate
individual transactions to allow for proper
review and audit.
Procurement – (p. 18)
(cid:131) User capabilities to perform critical functions
on the automated payment system were not
adequately restricted. Procedures designed to
compensate for this weakness were not
adequate.
Payroll – (p.22)
(cid:131) Users were assigned incompatible payroll
system capabilities, which allowed them to
perform critical functions without independent
review.
Information Technology – (p.29)
(cid:131) Computer resources were not properly secured
and certain security updates were not installed.

information security program or disaster recovery
plan.
