Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Our review of closeout transactions disclosed
general compliance with the applicable laws, regulations, and policies. However,
we determined that certain transactions pertaining to the following agencies were
not in compliance:
Department of State Police
Maryland Department of Health
Maryland Department of Labor
Maryland Insurance Administration
Maryland State Department of Education
Additionally, we noted significant potential liabilities pertaining to the Maryland
Department of Health and the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange that were
reported at June 30, 2020.
A summary of our findings, by agency, is included in Exhibit 1.
Generally, the non-compliant transactions we identified suggest that additional
State funds may be required to eliminate potential deficits. Specifically, one State
department recorded federal fund revenues totaling $5,875,000 that were deemed
unrecoverable. Another department reported revenues totaling $551.5 million
that, according to the State’s independent auditor, could not be recorded under
generally accepted accounting principles. This department also, because of
certain automated system failures, made estimated payments totaling

--- Page 4 ---
approximately $1.06 billion to behavioral health service providers between
January and August 2020, resulting in potential overpayments of approximately
$225.6 million and potential underpayments of approximately $61.7 million. The
department advised us that, effective August 13, 2020, the system was corrected
and that payments were based on actual claims submitted. Although
investigations of overpayments and underpayments were started in December
2020, we were advised that any recoupment of overpayments will not begin until
June 2021. We also found that another department retained $235,000 in unused
State grant funds without legal authority, and a further department had a year-end
special fund deficit balance totaling approximately $509,000.
In addition, one department reported a total of $40.3 million in unprovided for
general fund payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2020 (Exhibit
2). Specifically, this department reported a liability of approximately $34.2
million attributable to the disallowance of certain claims by the federal
government. A similar condition was included in our reports on the review of the
fiscal years 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 closeout transactions related to this
department. Furthermore, the department reported an additional unprovided for
payable of approximately $6.1 million related to the over expenditure of a certain
appropriation. We also identified one other agency that had a potential $28.4
million federal liability. The expenditures related to these liabilities may have to
be funded with subsequent year appropriations (or through a deficiency
appropriation). Finally, one department did not transfer funds totaling $8.1
million to another department as required by State law.
The primary objective of this annual review is to alert the Maryland General
Assembly to significant financial and budgetary closeout practices that do not
comply with applicable laws, regulations, and policies and to determine if other
significant liabilities existed at fiscal year-end. The issues identified during this
review will be fully addressed, as appropriate, in our fiscal compliance audit
reports on the applicable agencies, which will include relevant recommendations.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the course of our
review by the Comptroller of Maryland’s General Accounting Division and by the
various State agencies.
Respectfully submitted,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closeout transactions that have not been previously recorded in the
State’s accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR).
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the CAFR,
which, as of January 22, 2021, had not yet been finalized for fiscal year 2020.
The firm will determine whether the State’s financial statements have been
presented fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the
State of Maryland as of June 30, 2020, and the respective changes in the financial
position and cash flows, for the year then ended in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (referred to as
GAAP).

Introduction, Objectives, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2020. This review was conducted under the authority of the
State Government Article, Section 2-1220 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
The objective of our review was to determine whether budget closeout
transactions, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, were properly supported and
made in accordance with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting
policies and to determine if other significant liabilities existed at fiscal year-end.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end transactions, based on our
assessment of risk and materiality, for 14 departments and independent agencies
to ascertain if the transactions were properly supported and made in accordance
with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies and to determine
if other significant liabilities existed at fiscal year-end. We reviewed, on a limited
basis, transactions processed subsequent to June 30, 2020 to determine if the
transactions were properly recorded (such as charged or credited to the proper
fiscal year).
As part of our current review, we contacted various officials of State agencies.
Our review excluded public colleges and universities and transactions processed
through the Transportation Trust Fund because the related financial activity does
not involve the State’s General Fund and/or because agencies have the authority
to retain unspent funds at year-end. Our conclusions for the aforementioned
objective are contained on page 7 of this report.
We also assessed the status of the six issues identified in our January 16, 2020
report entitled Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year
2019. We determined three of the six issues were resolved. The remaining three
issues are repeated and appear as four issues in this report (see Exhibit 1).
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
reported. We advised the appropriate agencies of our findings. Formal responses
were not requested since this report contains no recommendations. Our fieldwork
was conducted during the period from September 2020 to January 2021.

Findings
Conclusion
Our review of State agencies’ budget closeout transactions disclosed that such
transactions were generally properly supported and made in accordance with State
budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies. However, we determined
that three departments or agencies were not in compliance primarily because
certain year-end transactions were not properly recorded, could not be
substantiated, or did not comply with budget closeout requirements. Additionally,
we determined that four agencies or departments had significant payables or
liabilities at June 30, 2020 that may require general funds.
Revenue Transactions
One department recorded federal fund revenues totaling approximately $5.9
million to cover certain expenditures. Although the department has advised the
Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) of its plan to
fund these expenditures using future sources of revenue, to the extent these funds
are not received, general funds will be required to eliminate the deficits resulting
from these transactions. Another department made a revenue accrual totaling
$551.5 million that was determined not to be allowable by the independent
auditor of the State’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
Expenditure Transactions
One department, because of certain automated system failures, made estimated
payments totaling approximately $1.06 billion to behavioral health service
providers between January and August 2020, resulting in potential overpayments
of approximately $225.6 million and potential underpayments of approximately
$61.7 million.
Encumbrance Transaction
One department improperly encumbered unused State grant funds totaling
$235,000 that should have been reverted to the State’s General Fund at fiscal
year-end.
Special Funds
One department had a long-standing year-end special fund deficit balance totaling
$509,000, which had increased from the prior year-end.
Other Liabilities
One department reported a total of $40.3 million in unprovided for general fund
payables or other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2020. For example, this
department, which had a similar issue in our five preceding closeout reports, may
7

--- Page 10 ---
require general funds of approximately $34.2 million to cover an unfunded
liability attributable to the disallowance of certain federal reimbursement claims.
Another agency had a potential $28.4 million liability to the federal government
related to certain misallocated expenditures. Furthermore, one agency could not
readily explain a deficit of $1.4 million.
According to an opinion of the Attorney General, unprovided for payables are not
a violation of State law if the General Assembly enacts a budget bill for the
subsequent year containing an appropriation that can be used to fund these
expenditures.
Other Issues
One agency could not justify retention of a certain fund balance, which totaled
$8.1 million as of June 30, 2020.
A summary of our findings, by agency, is included in Exhibit 1.
Revenue Transactions
Finding 1
The Maryland Department of Labor has determined that $5,875,000 in
previously recorded federal fund revenues is unrecoverable.
Analysis
Our January 16, 2020 report on the Statewide Review of Budget Closeout
Transactions for Fiscal Year 2019 noted that Maryland Department of Labor
(MDL) had unsubstantiated accrued federal fund revenues totaling $6,375,000,
which MDL had deemed to be unrecoverable. These accrued revenues related to
the projected recovery of past indirect costs incurred to administer certain federal
programs.
The April 2020 Joint Chairmen’s Report required MDL to provide a report
indicating where in State records this debt is located and a detailed plan to pay
down the remaining debt. In a letter dated September 30, 2020 to the Chairs of
the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Appropriations Committees, MDL
indicated that it will offset these unrecovered costs over several years by an
indirect cost surcharge to most MDL programs of up to $500,000 per year until
recovered. The funding source was anticipated to be split between general funds
and special funds from MDL’s Special Administrative Expense Fund. The letter
further stated that, during fiscal year 2020, $500,000 had been applied reducing
8

--- Page 11 ---
the unrecoverable balance to $5,875,000, and that this was reported to GAD as
part of the year-end closing process.
The recording of these unsubstantiated federal fund revenues was also disclosed
in our Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2016,
2017, and 2018 dated January 25, 2017, January 24, 2018, and January 15, 2019,
respectively, and our fiscal compliance audit report on the Department of Labor,
Licensing and Regulation’s Office of the Secretary dated August 7, 2017.
Finding 2
The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) recorded accrued revenue
totaling approximately $551.5 million at June 30, 2020 which, according to
the State’s independent auditors, are not allowed to be recorded under
generally accepted accounting principles for purposes of the State’s fiscal
year 2020 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
Analysis
Maryland Department of Health (MDH) recorded accrued revenue totaling
approximately $551.5 million at June 30, 2020 which, according to the State’s
independent auditors, are not allowed to be recorded under generally accepted
accounting principles for purposes of the State’s fiscal year 2020 Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report. The accrual relates to COVID-19 expenditures
incurred by MDH, which MDH anticipates being reimbursed by the federal
government through the Federal Emergency Management Administration’s
(FEMA) Public Assistance grant program. If the accrued revenues are not
recorded, an unprovided for payable results as related costs have already been
incurred.
As of June 30, 2020, MDH had not yet requested reimbursement of these
expenditures and the independent auditors have indicated that the aforementioned
accrual cannot be substantiated until FEMA has acted upon an MDH request for
reimbursement and provided certain documentation back to MDH to that effect.
MDH stated that its first request for reimbursement was submitted in November
2020, but as of January 19, 2021 the aforementioned required documentation has
not been received back from FEMA. That first request for reimbursement was for
cost incurred totaling $454.9 million.

Expenditure Transactions
Finding 3
According to a report prepared by MDH, because of certain automated
system failures, estimated payments totaling approximately $1.06 billion
were made to behavioral health service providers between January and
August 2020, resulting in potential overpayments of approximately $225.6
million and potential underpayments of approximately $61.7 million.
Analysis
According to a report prepared by MDH, because of certain automated system
failures, estimated payments totaling approximately $1.06 billion were made to
behavioral health service providers between January and August 2020, resulting
in potential overpayments of approximately $225.6 million and potential
underpayments of approximately $61.7 million.
On January 1, 2020, MDH’s new Administrative Service Organization (ASO)
vendor assumed responsibility for managing the MDH behavioral health claims
processing and payment functions. According to MDH, at its initial launch, the
ASO’s system had technical and system failures that impacted behavioral
provider payments; for example, erroneously denying claims. As a result,
beginning January 23, 2020, MDH management directed the ASO to provide
weekly estimated payments to providers to ensure providers were paid for
services rendered. These estimated payments continued through August 3, 2020,
and were calculated based on the average of each provider’s 2019 weekly
payment history.
According to MDH, estimated payments totaled approximately $35 million per
week, and approximately $1.06 billion for the entire period of January 23, 2020 to
August 3, 2020. During that period, providers were required to continue
submitting claims and, as of November 13, 2020, the ASO had authorized as
valid, claims submitted for the period totaling $894.7 million. According to
MDH, the net difference between estimated payments and authorized claims
included $225.6 million in possible overpayments to approximately 2,200
providers and $61.7 million in possible underpayments to approximately 400
providers.1
1 The overpayment and underpayment amounts reported by MDH and noted above net to $163.9,
which does not equate to the $165.3 million difference between the estimated payments ($1.06
billion) and validated claims ($894.7 million) also reported by MDH and noted above. The
difference of $1.4 million was not pursued by us during this review.
10

--- Page 13 ---
However, as of December 2020, MDH and the ASO were continuing to work
with providers to determine specific amounts over and under paid during the
aforementioned period, and to establish procedures for the proper disposition of
each, such as recouping amounts found to have been overpaid. MDH advised that
this process will be concluded by April 2021, and that any recoupment necessary
will begin in June 2021. MDH further advised that it permitted reactivation of the
ASO’s system in July 2020, and that estimated payments were stopped August 3,
2020. According to MDH, beginning August 13, 2020 payments have been made
based on actual claims submitted.
Encumbrance Transaction
Finding 4
The Maryland State Department of Education improperly encumbered
$235,000 in unused State grant funds that should have been reverted to the
State’s General Fund at year-end.
Analysis
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) improperly
encumbered unused State grant funds totaling $235,000 that should have been
reverted to the State’s General Fund at fiscal year-end. These funds had been
awarded to a local government by MSDE’s Division of Library Development and
Services (DLDS) in July 2017. Effective that same month, State law established
the Maryland State Library as an independent State agency. The Maryland State
Library essentially assumed the functions of DLDS, and DLDS ceased as a
division within MSDE. At that point in time, the aforementioned funds were
retained and had not been distributed to the local government. MSDE
inappropriately continuously recorded this encumbrance for the State grant funds
during fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020 without supporting documentation. As
of December 2020, MSDE had not reverted the funds and did not have support for
retaining this encumbrance.
11

--- Page 14 ---
Special Funds
Finding 5
The Department of State Police had a year-end special fund deficit balance
totaling $509,000.
Analysis
The Department of State Police (DSP) had a special fund deficit balance totaling
approximately $509,000 within its Operations Bureau at June 30, 2020. This is an
increase of $24,000 from the $485,000 deficit balance noted in our January 16,
2020 report on the Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal
Year 2019. We were advised that this deficit remains in spite of DSP’s efforts to
address a long-standing unexplained deficit of special fund balances first
identified in our fiscal compliance audit report dated November 23, 2015. Since
then, this deficit condition has been reported in our two preceding budgetary
closeout reports and our fiscal compliance audit report dated September 23, 2019.
During our current review, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)
confirmed to us that it had authorized DSP to use collections for the salvage
vehicle inspection program to reduce the deficit. However, in November 2020,
DSP advised us that expenditures for that program had exceeded collections for
the year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby increasing rather than
helping to decrease DSP’s deficit balance as noted above. This increase in the
deficit was reported to GAD at June 30, 2020. As noted in our fiscal year 2019
budgetary closeout report, DBM had advised DSP that, as part of the fiscal year
2021 budget cycle, it would work with DSP to consider the best way to address
the remaining deficit balance going forward. During our current review, we noted
that a similar commitment was made by DBM for the fiscal year 2022 budget
cycle.
Other Liabilities
Finding 6
The MDH – Developmental Disabilities Administration reported a total of
$40.3 million in unprovided for general fund payables and other general
fund liabilities as of June 30, 2020.
Analysis
MDH Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) reported unprovided
for payables and other general fund liabilities totaling $40.3 million. This amount
12

--- Page 15 ---
consists of two different components; $6.1 million in unprovided for payables
related to expenses paid to providers that exceeded the appropriation for DDA’s
Community Service Program, and $34.2 million in disallowed federal fund claims
related to the DDA’s residential habilitation add-on services under its Community
Pathways waiver program (a Medicaid funded program).
Regarding the disallowed claims, the federal Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) – Office of the Inspector General (OIG), in its June 2015 audit
report, disallowed these DDA claims and recommended that DDA refund the
overbilled amount to the federal HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS). In MDH’s September 24, 2015 response to the audit report and
to CMS, MDH disagreed with the OIG’s interpretation of waiver requirements
and urged CMS to reconsider requiring MDH to refund the $34.2 million in
disallowed claims. In a letter dated June 26, 2018, CMS issued a formal
disallowance letter requiring the refund of the identified $34.2 million. On
August 23, 2018, MDH issued a Request for Reconsideration letter to HHS to
begin the appeals process related to CMS' determination.
The CMS disallowance letter provided that MDH could elect to either retain or
return the funds in question during the appeals process; however, should HHS
confirm CMS' decision, any amount retained by MDH would be subject to
interest. MDH's Request for Reconsideration, stated that it had elected to retain
the funds during the appeals process; therefore, depending on HHS’ final
determination, MDH could be required to pay the federal government the original
$34.2 million in disallowed claims and any accrued interest. Since the August
2018 Request for Reconsideration letter, there has been no further action or
correspondence regarding HHS’ final determination.
Comments regarding the $34.2 million in federal claims disallowances relating to
MDH have been made in our five preceding Statewide Review of Budget Closeout
Transactions reports.
Finding 7
The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange had a potential $28.4 million liability
to the federal government related to certain misallocated expenditures.
Analysis
The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE) had a $28.4 million potential
liability to the federal government related to a previous audit finding by the HHS
– OIG of certain misallocated expenditures. This issue was also addressed in our
reports on the Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year
13

--- Page 16 ---
2018 and 2019, dated January 15, 2019 and January 16, 2020, respectively. In a
letter dated September 1, 2019 to the Chairs of the Senate Budget and Taxation
and House Appropriations Committees, MHBE noted that the HHS – Office of
General Counsel had recommended that MHBE rely on a previous determination
by HHS’ CMS that MHBE followed CMS’ guidance when allocating
establishment grant expenditures. In correspondence dated October 8, 2020,
CMS informed MHBE that there was no change to that recommendation, but also
that no formal resolution of the audit finding was yet available.
Finding 8
The Maryland Insurance Administration could not readily explain a deficit
in the Health Care Regulatory Fund, which totaled $1.4 million as of June
30, 2020.
Analysis
Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) could not readily explain a
growing deficit balance in the Health Care Regulatory Fund. MIA administers
the Fund, which consists of assessments on specified providers of health
insurance in the State. State law provides that annual assessments are to cover all
costs relating to activities of MIA’s Appeals and Grievances Unit. Our review
disclosed that the Fund had a deficit balance of approximately $250,000 as of
June 30, 2017, which increased to a deficit of approximately $1.4 million as of
June 30, 2020. That $1.4 million balance was improperly offset by unrelated
surplus funds in the Insurance Regulation Fund and therefore, MIA did not report
the deficit at fiscal year-end to the General Accounting Division as required.
Although a temporary deficit balance may periodically occur due to the timing of
related transactions, a long-term and growing deficit balance may be indicative of
inaccurate assessments and/or recording errors.
14

--- Page 17 ---
Other Issues
Finding 9
MIA did not transfer the balance in the Health Care Provider Rate
Stabilization Fund (RSF), which totaled $8.1 million as of June 30, 2020, to
MDH as required by State law.
Analysis
MIA could not justify retention of the RSF fund balance, which totaled $8.1
million2 as of June 30, 2020. In accordance with State Law, any funds in the RSF
should be transferred to MDH for the purpose of retaining certain health care
providers in the State. MIA management claimed that a fund balance was
necessary to cover any health maintenance organizations (HMO) and managed
care organizations (MCO) premium tax refunds that were required to be paid.
However, refunds processed during fiscal years 2019 and 2020 related to HMO
and MCO premium taxes totaled $17,000 and $3 million, respectively, well below
the $8.1 million retained by MIA.
By law, premium taxes collected by MIA are to be credited to the State’s General
Fund, except for taxes collected from HMOs and MCOs that are to be credited to
the State’s RSF, which is administered by MIA. State law requires that funds in
the RSF must be periodically transferred by MIA to MDH.
Chapter 538, Laws of Maryland 2020, repeals the RSF effective July 1, 2021;
after which all premium tax payments will be deposited to the General Fund.
Although the RSF is scheduled for repeal, it is still incumbent upon MIA to
ensure that all funds are properly accounted for.
2 This amount includes a $2.4 million accounting error for an entry made after the close of fiscal
year 2019, which had not been addressed by the end of fiscal year 2020. MIA needs to
determine if these funds should be reverted to the General Fund.
