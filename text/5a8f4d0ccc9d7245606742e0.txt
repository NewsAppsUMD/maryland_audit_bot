Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Office of the Clerk of Circuit
Court for Anne Arundel County, Maryland for the period beginning January 8,
2020 and ending January 19, 2024. The Office performs various functions for the
public, including maintaining various legal records, recording certain real estate
documents, collecting related fees and taxes, and issuing certain licenses.
Our audit disclosed that the Office did not always perform documented
independent verifications to ensure collections received were deposited. In
addition, the Office did not ensure that adequate controls existed for check
disbursements from its trust fund bank accounts. As a result, amounts could be
misappropriated from these accounts without immediate detection.
The Judiciary’s response to this audit, on behalf of the Office, is included as an
appendix to this report. We reviewed the response to our findings and related
recommendations, and have concluded that the corrective actions identified are
sufficient to address all audit issues.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the audit by the
Office. We also wish to acknowledge the Judiciary’s and the Office’s willingness
to address the audit issues and implement appropriate corrective actions.
Respectfully submitted,
Brian S. Tanen
Brian S. Tanen, CPA, CFE

Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Office performs a variety of functions for the public such as filing, docketing,
and maintaining various legal records; recording documents involving title to real
estate; collecting the related fees, commissions, and taxes; and issuing certain
licenses. In performing these functions, the Office collects funds on behalf of the
State, Anne Arundel County and its incorporated municipalities, and subsequently
distributes the funds collected to the applicable entities.
Financial Information
According to the State's accounting records, the Office's fiscal year 2023 revenues
totaled $43,884,171. These revenues were distributed in the following manner:
 $1,304,036 was distributed to Anne Arundel County and its incorporated
municipalities, and
 $42,580,135 (the remaining amount) represented revenues available to the
State for purposes specified in various provisions of State law.
The majority of the Office's fiscal year 2023 expenditures, which totaled
$12,662,245 (see Figure 1 on the following page), were salaries and wages that
were paid primarily from a general fund appropriation.
The Office also maintained custody of certain trust funds that, according to its
records, had balances totaling $1,582,647 as of December 31, 2023.

Findings and Recommendations
Cash Receipts
Finding 1
The Office did not always perform documented independent verifications to
ensure collections received were deposited.
Analysis
The Office did not always perform documented independent verifications to
ensure collections received were deposited. We arbitrarily selected 15 daily
collections totaling approximately $1.1 million during the period from May 2023
through October 2023. Our review of these collections disclosed that there was
4

--- Page 7 ---
no documentation of a deposit verification for 10 of the days tested with related
collections totaling $851,353, and for 4 other days totaling $185,867 the deposit
verifications were performed by employees that had access to the related
collections. As a result, there was a lack of assurance that all Office collections
were deposited. Our testing did not disclose any discrepancies between amounts
collected and the subsequent deposits.
The Comptroller of Maryland’s Accounting Procedures Manual requires
independent verification of collections to deposit. According to the Office’s
records, during fiscal year 2023 it collected $43.9 million, primarily for land
transactions, including $24.1 million in cash and checks and $19.8 million
received electronically (online and credit card).
Recommendation 1
We recommend that the Office perform an independent and documented
verification of collections received to amounts deposited. We advised the
Office how to achieve the necessary separation of duties using existing
personnel.
Trust Funds
Finding 2
The Office did not establish adequate controls over disbursements from trust
fund bank accounts.
Analysis
The Office did not establish adequate controls over disbursements from trust fund
bank accounts. The Office maintained two trust fund bank accounts for court
related activity such as collection and subsequent disbursements of criminal bond
amounts to payees based on a court order. Our review disclosed that three
employees who were authorized to sign checks for disbursements from the
accounts also had unrestricted access to blank checks. In addition, the checks,
which were processed through the Maryland Electronic Courts management
system, only required one signature by the authorized employees. As a result, one
employee could unilaterally disburse funds from the account without any
additional oversight.
During fiscal year 2023 disbursements from the accounts totaled approximately
$1 million. Our test of ten disbursements made during the period January 2023
through October 2023 totaling $529,696, (selected based on materiality) did not
disclose any improper disbursements. The Comptroller of Maryland’s Accounting
5

--- Page 8 ---
Procedures Manual and the Clerk of Court Accounting Manual both require
adequate segregation of duties for check disbursements.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that the Office ensure employees authorized to sign checks do
not have unrestricted access to blank checks and consider implementing a dual
signature process for checks.
Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Office of the Clerk of Circuit
Court for Anne Arundel County, Maryland for the period beginning January 8,
2020 and ending January 19, 2024. The audit was conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine the Office’s
financial transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance
with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included cash receipts (including taxes and fees collected
for real estate transactions and access over the automated receipt system), certain
payroll activities, and bank accounts.
Our audit did not include a review of certain support services provided to the
Office by the Administrative Office of the Courts. These support services (such
as human resources and payroll activities, invoice processing, and maintenance of
budgetary accounting records) are included within the scope of our audits of the
Judiciary.
Our assessment of internal controls was based on agency procedures and controls
in place at the time of our fieldwork. Our tests of transactions and other auditing
procedures were generally focused on the transactions occurring during our audit
period of January 8, 2020 to January 19, 2024, but may include transactions
6

--- Page 9 ---
before or after this period as we considered necessary to achieve our audit
objectives.
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, tests of transactions,
and to the extent practicable, observations of the Office’s operations. Generally,
transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgment, which primarily
considers risk, the timing or dollar amount of the transaction, or the significance
of the transaction to the area of operation reviewed. As a matter of course, we do
not normally use sampling in our tests, so unless otherwise specifically indicated,
neither statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was used to select the
transactions tested. Therefore, unless sampling is specifically indicated in a
finding, the results from any tests conducted or disclosed by us cannot be used to
project those results to the entire population from which the test items were
selected. We also performed other auditing procedures that we considered
necessary to achieve our audit objectives. The reliability of data used in this
report for background or informational purposes was not assessed.
The Office’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial
records; effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including safeguarding of
assets; and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
As provided in Government Auditing Standards, there are five components of
internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities,
information and communication, and monitoring. Each of the five components,
when significant to the audit objectives, and as applicable to the Office, were
considered by us during the course of this audit.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes findings relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect the Office’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
7

--- Page 10 ---
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. The findings are also considered significant instances of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Other less significant
findings were communicated to the Office that did not warrant inclusion in this
report.
The response from the Judiciary, on behalf of the Office, to our findings and
recommendations is included as an appendix to this report. As prescribed in the
State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we will advise the Judiciary regarding the results of our review of its response.
