Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Information Technology Division (ITD) operates the Annapolis Data Center
as a shared cost data center. All operating costs are reimbursed by user agencies
that are charged for services performed. According to the State’s records,
operating costs totaled approximately $27 million during fiscal year 2007. ITD
also develops and maintains application systems for the Comptroller of the
Treasury and certain other State agencies, operates a statewide computer network,
and provides data center disaster recovery capabilities. Additionally, ITD
maintains the operating system and security software environment in which
agency applications are executed.
Our audit focused on ITD’s fiscal operations. A separate audit of the computer
operations of the Annapolis Data Center will be conducted in the future and a
separate audit report will be issued.
Findings and Recommendations
Our audit did not disclose any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
ITD’s internal control. Nor did our audit disclose any significant instances of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
A draft copy of this report was provided to ITD. Since there are no
recommendations in this report, a written response was not necessary.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have audited the fiscal operations of the Comptroller of the Treasury –
Information Technology Division (ITD) for the period beginning September 6,
2005 and ending February 10, 2008. The audit was conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine ITD’s financial
transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance with
applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of materiality and risk. Our audit
procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspections of documents
and records, and observations of ITD’s fiscal operations. We also tested
transactions and performed other auditing procedures that we considered
necessary to achieve our objectives. Data provided in this report for background
or informational purposes were deemed reasonable, but were not independently
verified.
Our audit included a review of certain support services provided by ITD to the
other units of the Comptroller of the Treasury. These support services consisted
of the procurement and monitoring of information technology related services,
and the procurement of information technology equipment and maintenance of the
related inventory records. Our audit did not include the computer operations of
ITD’s Annapolis Data Center, which will be the subject of a separate audit and
result in the issuance of a separate audit report. Our audit also did not include a
review of certain support services provided to ITD by the Comptroller of the
Treasury - Office of the Comptroller. These support services (such as processing
of invoices, maintenance of accounting records and related fiscal functions) are
included in the scope of our audits of the Office of the Comptroller.
ITD’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.

Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
