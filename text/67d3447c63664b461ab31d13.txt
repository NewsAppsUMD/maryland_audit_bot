Re: Audit of Baltimore County Public Schools
Dr. Myriam Rogers, Superintendent
Baltimore County Public Schools
6901 North Charles Street
Towson, Maryland 21204
Dear Dr. Rogers:
We received your request for a 12-month delay of our upcoming audit of the Baltimore
County Public Schools (BCPS) due to the ongoing implementation of a new enterprise resource
planning (ERP) project. To that end, we requested an implementation status for the 11 findings
included in our most recent report of BCPS. In response to our request, BCPS provided a status
report on March 5, 2025, which indicated that BCPS had fully addressed 9 of the 11 report
findings and portions of the remaining two findings were still in progress.
Based on the circumstances and the reported status of the prior findings, your request for
a 12-month delay of the BCPS audit has been approved.
Sincerely,
Brian S. Tanen
