AUDIT FINDING AND RECOMMENDATION
Improve Overall Operational Controls
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission began a year of transition in July 2013, when its long
standing Executive Secretary retired and a replacement came from outside of the organization.
Although this audit covers fiscal year 2013, we noted several areas where controls are not in place
or are not functioning properly to ensure safeguards over assets since the transition began.
The Administrative Assistant does not secure the Commission’s debit card. Management was
informed of this lack of control during the fiscal year 2012 audit and took steps to correct this
immediately; however, upon follow-up in fiscal year 2013, the Administrative Assistant is again
keeping the debit card in an unsecured location.
The Executive Secretary did not document his review of the last payroll in fiscal year 2013
and has not documented any payroll review during fiscal year 2014. Management review of payroll
transactions is crucial to ensure that only current employees receive the correct pay.
Commission staff and the new Executive Secretary did not prepare or review the
June 30, 2013, operating account reconciliation until October 15, 2013, and did not review or
reconcile other bank accounts until April 14, 2014, which resulted in the recording of bank service
charges and interest revenues in the wrong period. Timely reconciliation of all bank accounts is
necessary to ensure that unauthorized expenditures do not occur and that deposits are properly
recorded. In addition, lack of reconciliation coupled with no controls over the debit card could result
in fraudulent charges that personnel would not catch within a timeframe that would allow
recoupment from the bank – normally required within 60 days. Further, delay in preparation of
reconciliations together with absence of a review of payroll transactions could result in incorrect pay
amounts and fraudulent payments to ghost employees.
The Commission should ensure that controls are in place to properly safeguard Commission
assets. This includes proper security surrounding the debit card; systematic documented review of
all payroll transactions by the Executive Secretary and/or Assistant Executive Secretary; and timely
reconciliation of all bank accounts.

AGENCY HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve
and improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing
Virginia.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the
following sources.
2012 2013
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000
Federal grant 104,147 109,024
Sport fishing licenses 132,370 144,926
Commercial fishing licenses 74,790 76,215
Commercial crab licenses 71,000 70,820
Commercial oyster licenses 3,570 46,610
Commercial license surcharge 41,650 35,950
Oyster bushel tax 328 3,415
Interest and miscellaneous 38,035 27,466
Total revenue $754,640 $803,176
The Commission’s revenues increased by six percent for fiscal year 2013 mainly due to an
increase in the sale of sport fishing and commercial licenses and a new oyster management reserve
program, discussed below. The decrease in revenues for interest and miscellaneous is attributable
to revenue from the sale of the Commission’s vehicle in 2012. In the past five years, sport fishing
license revenues have trended upwards and commercial licenses continue on an upward trend as
can be seen in the following chart:

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:
2012 2013
Personnel services $356,232 $373,605
Development and repletion 4,387 106,526
Federal grant 92,275 105,565
Contractual services 69,665 89,864
Materials and supplies 51,770 56,073

Operating Expenses 609,120 739,903
Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Oyster development 31,500 42,473
Retiree health care 50,000 75,000
Reserve Expenses 81,500 117,473
Total Expenses $690,620 $857,376
Operating expenses increased by $130,783 or twenty-two percent from fiscal year 2012. This
is attributable to two new oyster programs created in fiscal year 2013, the Oyster Management
Reserve (OMR) program and the Rotational Natural Oyster Harvest Program (RNOHP).

The Commission continues to study and promote development of a self-sustaining oyster
industry in the Potomac. The OMR program had 23 participants in 2013 which yielded $30,725 in
additional license revenues and projections for fiscal year 2014 and beyond show additional
increases. The RNOHP began late in fiscal year 2013 and had no participants but did incur $53,296
in development and repletion expenses. During fiscal year 2013, the Commission set aside an
additional $42,473 to fund future oyster work. The Commission maintains the set aside funds for
future oyster work in accounts located in both Virginia and Maryland. Interest accrues on these
accounts at the market rate.
Funding of retiree health insurance has been a continuing concern of the Commission. In
fiscal year 2013, an actuarial study indicated the Commission needs to set aside a minimum of
$53,500 per year to ensure current employees’ healthcare is funded upon retirement. The study
used a base amount of $250,000; therefore, the Commission set aside $75,000 to bring the retiree
health insurance account in line with the calculated base. Interest accrues on this account at the
market rate. Additionally, the Commission established a trust to administer and maintain these
funds naming the Commission’s Legal Officer as trustee.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2013 with an operating gain of $63,273. After factoring in
the reserve expense of $117,473, the Commission’s operating loss was $54,200. This is the first year
in over five years that the Commission did not realize a net gain. The additional funding to the retiree
health insurance account and increased development and repletion expenses have caused this
overall loss.
The ability of the Commission to continue to retain more cash each year is dependent on
whether they continue to hold down spending on operations and bring in revenues at the current
level or higher, thus making funds available to set aside each year for future liabilities and ongoing
oyster programs. The Commission closed fiscal year 2013 with a cash balance of $593,042 to include
$226,282 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts and a separate Virginia investment
pool account for retiree health care reserves, with a balance of $251,458 as of June 30, 2013.

Governor of Virginia
The Honorable John M. O’Bannon, III
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2013. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial
transactions in the Commission’s accounting system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s
internal controls, and test compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant
agreements.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed
to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent
of our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles,
classes of transactions, and account balances.

Appropriations
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate,
had been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance
with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit
procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and
contracts, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We tested transactions and performed
analytical procedures, including budgetary and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with
outside parties.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts
recorded and reported in the Commission’s accounting system. The Commission records its financial
transactions on the cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other
than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial
information presented in this report came directly from the Commission’s accounting system.
We noted a matter involving internal control and its operation that requires management’s
attention and corrective action. This matter is described in the section entitled “Audit Finding and
Recommendation.” The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws, regulations ,
contracts and grant agreements disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are
required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on May 20, 2014. Management’s response to
the findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Agency Response.” We did not
audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the state of Maryland and is a
public record.
