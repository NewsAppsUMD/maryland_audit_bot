Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2012 to November 30, 2012
1) Department of Information Technology (DoIT) and Selected State Agencies –
Information System Data Security (Performance) (9/27/12 – 41 pages – 12 findings)
We conducted a performance audit to assess State law and policies governing information
security as compared to industry and government best practices and determined compliance
with certain aspects of the Department of Information Technology’s (DoIT) Information
Security Policy by selected State agencies.
We evaluated State law and the September 2010 Information Security Policy (in existence
during our audit) against industry information security best practices and federal and other
states’ practices.
• Current State law governing certain protections for personal identifiable information (PII)
did not apply to State agencies and certain requirements established in State law also
were not addressed in the DoIT Policy.
• DoIT did not have a formal process in place to monitor and enforce the provisions of its
Policy.
• Some enhancements should be made to DoIT’s Policy. For example, the Policy
provided only limited guidance to agencies for handling and reporting computer security
incidents (such as unauthorized access or denial of service attacks).
We reviewed five State agencies’ security policies and practices for compliance with seven
specific requirements of the DoIT Policy and found that none of the five agencies had
implemented all security program components required by DoIT.
• State agencies often had not determined and did not document the security levels for
their information systems.
• Risk management processes were not fully implemented.
• State agencies were in various stages in implementing data loss prevention tools and
techniques and had varied practices in implementing vulnerability scanning and
penetration testing.

Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2012 to November 30, 2012
2) Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) (Financial Management Practices Audit
Report) (9/28/12 – 52 pages – 26 findings)
We conducted a performance audit to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the school
system’s financial management practices in safeguarding assets and its use of financial
resources. Our report contains 26 recommendations based upon the review of 11 functional
areas.
• BCPSS had not sufficiently pursued collection of past due accounts, including amounts
due from former employees.
• Procurement and disbursement processing duties were not properly separated. Also,
BCPSS did not comply with procurement requirements for two large contracts and did
not obtain supporting documentation to substantiate certain payments to contractors.
• Critical human resources and payroll transactions were not independently reviewed for
propriety. Furthermore, certain overtime payments could not be substantiated and
certain other payments were improperly calculated.
• BCPSS could not provide sufficient justification as to why salary reductions to certain
administrators, in excess of $300,000, were not processed.
• Personnel policies were not sufficiently comprehensive.
• BCPSS did not adequately follow up on missing computer equipment.
• BCPSS did not adequately monitor and secure information systems, and had not
developed a disaster recovery plan.
• A long-term facilities master plan had not been prepared to address issues such as
facility conditions, utilization, and future needs.
• BCPSS did not ensure that contractors had properly completed maintenance projects
prior to approving the related invoices for payment.
• BCPSS had not established comprehensive bus routing policies, documented the basis
for the daily fixed route rates paid to contractors to operate school buses, and did not
ensure the propriety of the billings.
• BCPSS did not ensure that amounts paid to organizations that operated charter schools
were proper. Also, BCPSS could not provide lease agreements for the 14 charter
schools that operated in buildings BCPSS owned.

Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2012 to November 30, 2012
3) Department of Transportation – Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) (11/16/12 – 18
pages – 8 findings)
• MAA did not establish adequate monitoring controls over Architectural and Engineering
(A&E) contracts and expenditures.
 MAA did not establish adequate monitoring controls over costs incurred for
individual A&E contracts, which precluded MAA from effectively monitoring
contract expenditures and remaining balances.
 For certain contracts, MAA did not provide the Board of Public Works (BPW) with
complete and accurate information when it requested contract approvals.
 MAA lacked procedures to ensure the propriety of overhead rates billed by A&E
firms. MAA did not ensure A&E firms obtained annual independent audits of
actual overhead rates, as required by the contracts.
 MAA did not review and approve subcontractors hired by A&E firms after the
initial contracts were procured.
 MAA did not ensure that comprehensive task orders were established for A&E
construction management and inspection services (CMI).
• MAA did not adequately restrict access and prevent unauthorized purchasing,
disbursement, and adjustment transactions in the Financial Management Information
System (FMIS). Numerous employees could process critical transactions without
independent approval.
• MAA equipment items purchased were not always accurately recorded in the inventory
records and were not identified timely as State property.
• MAA’s records for snow removal chemicals did not include information necessary to
effectively manage and control inventories, as required by State policies.

Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2012 to November 30, 2012
4) Department of Transportation – State Highway Administration (SHA) (11/15/12 – 24
pages – 10 findings)
• SHA’s policies and procedures for architectural and engineering (A&E) contracts did not
provide the necessary safeguards to ensure compliance with certain State procurement
regulations and Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) guidelines.
 SHA had not documented the basis for the maximum values of A&E contracts
submitted to the Board of Public Works (BPW) for approval.
 SHA used unexpended balances from various A&E contracts to pay for work that
was outside the scope of those contracts. As of August 2012, the preliminary
results of a survey conducted by SHA identified services costing $21.7 million
charged to 105 contracts that were for purposes outside the scope of those
contracts.
 SHA extended contract expiration dates without BPW approval, enabling SHA to
retain unspent contract authorizations on contracts that otherwise would have
expired.
 SHA’s post-audit process for determining the propriety of A&E contractor billings
for direct labor costs selected only a limited number of contractors for audit.
• In August 2009, SHA established the Maryland SafeZones Program (that is, the
automated speed monitoring program for highway work zones). Initially, a pilot program
was conducted using an intergovernmental cooperative purchasing agreement with a
local jurisdiction. Subsequently, SHA awarded a two-year contract to the sole bidder to
operate the monitoring program.
 SHA did not ensure that contractor performance benchmarks were established for
the SafeZones pilot program.
 SHA awarded the two-year contract to operate the program even though the
contractor’s proposal did not comply with certain requirements, and the tests
conducted of the equipment did not conform to SHA requirements.
 SHA did not have procedures to verify that the SafeZones contractor met a key
performance measure.
• A management employee participated in the monitoring of a consulting services
contract which was a potential violation of State ethics laws.
