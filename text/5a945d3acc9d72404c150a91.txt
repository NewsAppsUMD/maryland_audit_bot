Ladies and Gentlemen:
We conducted a performance audit to determine the accuracy of selected
Managing for Results (MFR) performance measure data reported in the Managing
for Results Annual Performance Report issued in April 2009. We also
determined whether adequate control systems were in place for collecting,
summarizing, and reporting the performance measure data.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, we are
systematically auditing the results of the 62 MFR measures contained in the
Managing for Results - State Comprehensive Plan, which was produced by the
Department of Budget and Management. This audit is the third to be conducted
on the 62 measures and focuses on the data reported for the two measures
contained within the Fiscal Responsibility portion of the State Comprehensive
Plan. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) was responsible for
reporting these results. A list of the 62 MFR measures is contained in Exhibit 3
of this report.
As a result of our audit, we have classified each of the two measures as Certified.
The available designation classifications are Certified, Certified with
Qualification, Inaccurate, or Factors Prevented Certification, as described in
Exhibit 2.

Executive Summary
Background Information
In July 1997, the Governor implemented the Managing for Results (MFR)
initiative, which is a strategic planning process used by department leaders and
others to establish direction and priorities for State programs to achieve
meaningful results. MFR requires State agencies to submit missions, goals,
objectives, and performance measures for each program as part of the annual
budget request. This information may then be considered in determining
Statewide spending priorities and the allocation of resources in agency budgets.
Effective July 1, 2004, the MFR process was established in State law, with the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM) as the lead agency for developing
a State comprehensive plan for MFR. The resultant Managing for Results - State
Comprehensive Plan categorizes MFR goals into five functional areas, referred to
as pillars, which contain a total of 62 measures.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, we are
systematically auditing these 62 measures. This audit is the third to be conducted
pursuant to this request and focuses on the data reported by DBM in its April
2009 Managing for Results Annual Performance Report, for the two measures
contained within the Fiscal Responsibility portion of the Plan (Exhibit 1). The
categories of performance certification are explained in Exhibit 2 of this report,
and a list of the 62 MFR measures is contained in Exhibit 3. Exhibit 4 references
the first two MFR audit reports issued by our Office, which collectively covered
19 measures in the Public Safety and Safer Neighborhoods and Education
portions of the State Comprehensive Plan.
Conclusions
We concluded that the two measures tested were Certified.

Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Scope
Under the authority of the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, we conducted an audit of selected performance
measure results reported in the April 2009 Managing for Results Annual
Performance Report. The audit was performed in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, we are
systematically auditing the performance measures from the Managing for Results
- State Comprehensive Plan produced by the Department of Budget and
Management (DBM). This Plan includes 62 performance measures categorized
into five functional areas referred to as pillars. This audit is the third to be
conducted pursuant to this request and focuses on the two performance measures
from the Fiscal Responsibility functional area as reported by DBM in the Report.
Objectives
The objectives of our audit were (1) to determine whether the most recent actual
measurement results for the selected performance measures were accurately
reported in DBM’s Managing for Results Annual Performance Report, and (2) to
determine whether adequate control systems existed over the collection and
reporting of the data related to the measurement results. Our performance audit
did not include an assessment of whether the performance measures reviewed
were consistent with the goals and objectives of the related programs, or were
meaningful indicators of program performance.
Methodology
To accomplish our objectives, we interviewed DBM personnel responsible for
collecting and reporting the measure data, reviewed performance measure
calculations for accuracy, reviewed the data collected and reported for the
performance measures, and determined whether the calculations and data were
consistent with the definitions of the performance measures as noted in Exhibit 1.
We also analyzed DBM’s performance measurement data collection and reporting
activities to evaluate whether proper controls existed to ensure data integrity.

--- Page 12 ---
We developed a system to categorize the results of our audit of performance
measures. The four categories represent varying levels of certification of the
accuracy of the performance reported by DBM. The categories of performance
certification are defined in Exhibit 2.
Our fieldwork was conducted on site at DBM during the period from December
2009 to January 2010. A draft copy of this report was provided to the Office.
Since there are no recommendations in this report, a written response was not
necessary.

Measure
Number of fiscal This measure presents the number of State fiscal years with a
years closed with a positive General Fund balance. The State fiscal year runs from July
positive General 1st through June 30th. The closing balance, which represents funds
Fund balance available for new fiscal year operations, is derived from an
accounting for all applicable factors such as revenues, expenditures,
revenue transfers, and reversions.
The transactions related to resources obtained and used for those
services traditionally provided by a state government, which are not
accounted for in other government funds, are accounted for in the
general fund. These services include, among other items, general
government; health and mental hygiene; education (other than higher
education institutions); human resources; public safety; judicial;
labor, licensing and regulation; natural resources and recreation;
housing and community development; environment; agriculture; and
business and economic development. The resources obtained from
federal grants and used for general fund activities consistent with
applicable legal requirements are recorded in the general fund.

Categories of Performance Certification
Category Definition
Certified Reported performance was reasonably accurate.
Certified with Reported performance was reasonably accurate even though
Qualification minor deficiencies were noted with the supporting
documentation, controls were not sufficient, or the
methodology used to calculate reported performance was not
consistent with the measure definition.
Inaccurate Reported performance differed significantly from actual
performance; the calculation process was wrong, such as
excluding data relevant to the calculation; or, as reported, the
measure was misleading, such as failing to disclose the
measure as a rate when applicable.
Factors Prevented Reported performance could not be verified, as documentation
Certification was unavailable, controls were not adequate to ensure the
accuracy of the results, or results were not presented in a
manner consistent with the performance measure description.
