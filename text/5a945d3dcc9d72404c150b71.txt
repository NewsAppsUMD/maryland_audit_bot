Mr. Karl S. Aro, Executive Director

Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we have performed desk reviews of the audit reports filed by each county,
incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2008. The desk reviews consisted of assessments of compliance with
accounting and auditing standards, evaluations of compliance with certain State
laws, and analyses of selected financial data to identify potential financial
problems.
Most of the local governments and their independent auditors substantially
complied with accounting and auditing standards for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2008. Nevertheless, we identified instances of noncompliance with certain
requirements of our audit guidelines, generally accepted accounting principles,
and/or generally accepted auditing standards. Letters were sent to 69 local
governments and to their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies
disclosed by our reviews so that corrective actions could be taken to help ensure
future compliance.

--- Page 4 ---
The financial statements disclosed 22 local governments with uninsured or
uncollateralized bank deposits, which is an area of noncompliance with State law.
In addition, our desk reviews identified 9 local governments with potential
financial problems, including deficit fund balances and unfavorable financial
trends. Where appropriate, letters were sent to these local governments, and to
their legislative representatives, to communicate their noncompliance or potential
financial problems, and to request that the local governments advise us of the
corrective actions that will be taken.
Respectfully submitted,
Bruce A. Myers, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Introduction and Scope
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires each
county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland to file annual
(once every four years under specified conditions) audit reports. There were 194
local government audit reports due for fiscal year 2008 (24 counties, 153 cities
and towns, and 17 taxing districts). The reports are to include financial
statements with accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions
as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented. The financial
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. We have prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide
additional information regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing
requirements.
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code requires the Office of Legislative Audits to
perform a desk review of each local government’s annual audit report for
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards.
Subsections (b) through (f) of Section 40 specify the reporting and review
requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by the counties. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is required to
review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2008 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as one fiscal year 2007 report (Mount Savage Special Taxing Area) and one
fiscal year 2006 report (Mount Savage Special Taxing Area) received subsequent
to our previous review. The desk reviews were performed to accomplish the
following tasks:
• Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and accounting and
auditing standards, using a checklist for governmental audits published by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
• Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits).

• Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances, underfunded pension plans, or unfavorable trends and ratios,
based on analyses of financial data over the most recent five-year period (July
1, 2003 through June 30, 2008).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2008 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
One local government had not filed audit reports for fiscal years 2007 and
2008, and six other local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal
year 2008. Forty-seven local governments submitted audit reports after the
required filing date.
One local government had not filed audit reports for fiscal years 2007 and 2008,
and six other local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal year 2008.
Furthermore, 47 local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date. The failure of a local government to file an audit report, or a delay in
filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The submission
of audit reports after the required filing date was also noted for 12 of these 47
local governments during our preceding year’s review. Article 19, Section 40(a)
of the Annotated Code of Maryland generally requires audit reports to be filed by
November 1 after the close of the fiscal year, or by January 1 after the close of the
fiscal year for those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2008 had not
been received, as of August 12, 2009, for the Town of Forest Heights. The failure
of this town to submit audit reports has been reported to the Executive Director of
the Department of Legislative Services. If these reports are not filed, the State
Comptroller, acting upon the advice of the Executive Director, is authorized by
law to discontinue the payment of all funds, grants, or State aid to which the town
is entitled.
Additionally, audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 had not been
received, as of August 12, 2009, for the following six local governments:
1. Town of Capitol Heights
2. Town of Deer Park
3. City of Hyattsville
4. Town of Lonaconing
5. Town of Westernport
6. Washington Suburban Transit Commission
We will review these fiscal year 2007 and 2008 audit reports and take any follow-
up action necessary when the reports are received. The results of these reviews
will be included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2009 local government
audit reports.

The Ellerslie Special Taxing Area requested and was granted a waiver from filing
an audit report in fiscal year 2008 because the Area met the conditions for filing
an audit report every fourth year as provided for under Article 19, Section 40(a)
of the Code. This entity will next be required to file an audit report for fiscal year
2011. The Towns of Barclay, Marydel, and Templeville, and the Village of Port
Tobacco had previously requested and were granted waivers from filing audit
reports. These entities will next be required to file an audit report for either fiscal
year 2009 or fiscal year 2010.
The audit report for one local government contained a qualified opinion but
did not appropriately identify the opinion units affected.
The audit report for the Town of Queenstown contained a qualified opinion on the
Town’s financial statements because certain financial data were not presented in
accordance with the requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board. Furthermore, the auditor did not distinguish between opinion units
affected by the qualified opinion and those not affected as explained in the State
and Local Governments Audit and Accounting Guide published by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
A qualified opinion is issued when the auditor states that “except for” the effects
of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial statements are
presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Although required by our audit guidelines, the auditor for the Town of
Queenstown did not submit a separate letter to the Office of Legislative Audits
explaining both the reasons for the qualified opinion, and the Town’s plan to
rectify the problem to enable the auditor to express an unqualified opinion in the
future.
Auditors’ reports for 10 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for 10 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The auditors’ reports for
4 of these local governmental units included a deficiency that was also cited
during our previous year’s review. The following is a summary of these
deficiencies:

Number of Audit
Area of Noncompliance
Reports
Auditor did not express an opinion(s) on all opinion units 5
or on all financial statements.
Auditor’s report did not report on all required information 5
(for example, supplemental information accompanying
the basic financial statements).
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires that audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. These
standards require, in part, that the auditor express an opinion(s) as to whether the
basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position, the respective changes in financial position, and cash flows,
where applicable, of the local government in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Financial statements submitted by 24 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 24 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of 3 of these local governments included two or more such
deficiencies, and the financial statements of 4 of these local governments included
a deficiency that was also cited during our preceding year’s review. The
following is a summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of
instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 24
presentation of Statement of Cash Flows was
improper).
All required financial statements were not presented or 4
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.

Financial statements and accompanying notes for five local governments did
not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or in
the accompanying notes, for five audit reports. The financial statements of one of
these local governments included two areas of insufficient disclosure, and the
financial statements for another included an area of insufficient disclosure that
was also cited during our preceding year’s review. Adequate disclosure is
necessary to facilitate the understanding of, and to provide for fair presentation of,
the financial information. The following is a summary of these areas of
insufficient disclosure and the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Area of Insufficient Disclosure
Instances
Cash deposits with financial institutions 3
Basis of accounting or revenue recognition policies 2
Capital assets 1
Noncompliance with State Law
Financial statements of 22 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law.
Financial statements of 22 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by State
law (Exhibit A). Article 95, Section 22 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires that deposits with financial institutions by local governmental units be
fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes the risk of loss of deposits in
the event the financial institution defaults.
Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.

--- Page 12 ---
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for six local
governments as of June 30, 2008.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for six local governments as
of June 30, 2008 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of the
current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem. Two of these local governments also had a general
fund deficit as of June 30, 2007.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local
governments as of June 30, 2008.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local governments as
of June 30, 2008 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local governments had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures.
The pension plan for one local government was significantly underfunded.
One local government had a pension plan that was significantly underfunded.
Specifically, members of the Fire and Police Departments of Baltimore City, who
were hired prior to January 1, 1947, were eligible for coverage under a defined
benefit retirement plan. All employees eligible under the plan have retired.
The City funds pension benefits under this plan on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.
During fiscal year 2008, the City contributed approximately $1.9 million to the
plan. The present value of future benefits related to this plan was approximately
$7.9 million as of June 30, 2008.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Code. Subsections (b) through (f) of this Section require that certain types of
special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the county in
which the districts are located within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year in
accordance with the rules and regulations established by the applicable county.
The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each district’s compliance with
10

--- Page 13 ---
the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting copies of these reports to
the Office of Legislative Audits.
The required reports have not been filed for seven special taxing districts.
As of August 12, 2009, we had not received the required reports for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2008 for seven special taxing districts, of which three are located
in Anne Arundel County and four are located in Baltimore City. Anne Arundel
County and Baltimore City advised us that they were in the process of pursuing
compliance with applicable filing requirements for these districts and that
appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding funds).
