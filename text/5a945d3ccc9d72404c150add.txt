Purpose of Review and Background Information
In accordance with the provisions of the Education Article, Section 16-315(h) of
the Annotated Code of Maryland, we have reviewed the audit reports that must be
filed by 15 of the State’s community colleges with the Maryland Higher
Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. We
reviewed these audit reports to determine compliance with the applicable statutes
and the guidelines promulgated by MHEC. We also reviewed the reports to
determine if any of the community colleges had deficit balances in unrestricted
net position, or uninsured/uncollateralized bank deposits. This report contains the
results of that review.
According to the State's records, State aid totaling approximately $281 million
was granted to 15 of Maryland’s 16 community colleges for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2014. This aid primarily consisted of funding based on cost and student
enrollment data. In addition, it included certain retirement benefits and various
other grants. The remaining college (Baltimore City Community College) is a
budgetary unit of the State and receives an annual State appropriation. Baltimore
City Community College is not subject to the Education Article, Section 16-
315(h) of the Annotated Code of Maryland; however, it obtains annual financial
statement audits that are conducted by a certified public accounting firm. The
College is also subject to fiscal compliance audits by the Office of Legislative
Audits for which separate audit reports are issued.
The Education Article, Section 16-315(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires MHEC to adopt guidelines for the preparation of annual audit reports on
the colleges. The guidelines promulgated by MHEC require independent auditors
to express opinions as to the fairness of presentation of the colleges’ financial
statements as well as of the cost and student enrollment data used for calculating
the State aid to the colleges. The guidelines also require the auditors to issue
management letters containing all material weaknesses in the colleges’ systems of
internal controls. While not required, many of the auditors issue management
letters that contain additional recommendations that were not considered material
weaknesses.

Results of Review
Audit Reports
All 15 audit reports for fiscal year 2014 were filed timely.
Our review disclosed that all 15 community college audit reports were filed
timely with the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2014.
The State’s community colleges are required by law to file annual audit reports
within 90 days of the fiscal year end (June 30) unless an extension is granted.
All audit reports expressed unqualified opinions and were presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Our review disclosed that all 15 community college audit reports for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2014 contained unqualified opinions from their auditors and
were presented in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
MHEC’s audit guidelines require the auditors to express opinions as to the
fairness of the presentation of the colleges’ financial statements and that the audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. An
unqualified opinion is issued when the auditor states that the applicable financial
statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Two community colleges’ financial statements disclosed deficit balances in
the unrestricted portion of their net position at June 30, 2014.
Our review disclosed two colleges with deficit balances in the unrestricted
component of their net position as of June 30, 2014. Specifically, Anne Arundel
and Carroll Community Colleges had unrestricted net position deficits of
$14,626,402 and $10,829,668, respectively. Furthermore, this situation was also
noted in the financial statements for Anne Arundel and Carroll Community
Colleges’ for each fiscal year since 2011 and 2009, respectively. For these two
colleges, the unrestricted net position deficits increased during fiscal year 2014.
An unrestricted net position deficit balance represents the costs of current or past
4

services that will need to be financed in future periods and could indicate a
potential financial problem.
We did not perform a detailed analysis to determine the cause of these deficits;
nevertheless, the Colleges’ financial statements and accompanying notes
contained certain pertinent information relative to the deficits. Specifically, both
Colleges’ financial statements disclosed that the decreases in net position
experienced during fiscal year 2014 were due, in part, to increases in the other
post employment benefit liabilities which increased by $3.6 million (to $29.9
million) for Anne Arundel Community College and $2.4 million (to $15.0
million) for Carroll Community College.
Generally accepted accounting principles specify that liabilities for post
employment benefits (such as healthcare benefits), which are deferred until
retirement or another future event, be recognized in the years in which the
employee provides services rather than during the postemployment period when
payments are made.
Management Letters
Management letters for fiscal year 2014 included a total of 18
recommendations for improvement, including 1 recommendation considered
to be a material weakness related to a college’s compliance with
requirements.
We reviewed the management letters applicable to the audits of the community
colleges that were filed with MHEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Our
review disclosed that 10 of the community colleges did not receive any
recommendations; the remaining 5 community colleges received a total of 18
recommendations, 1 of which was considered a material weakness related to
accounting and financial reporting compliance requirements. The material
weakness was found at Carroll Community College.
As required by the Education Article, Section 16-315(c) of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, MHEC evaluated the adequacy of the College’s response to the
material weakness and determined that appropriate corrective actions were
indicated.
MHEC did not formally evaluate the adequacy of the colleges’ responses to the
17 other recommendations since, in accordance with MHEC’s guidelines,
comments and suggestions related to these deficiencies are not required. When

auditors include such items in the letters, the colleges’ follow-up actions are
subject to the auditors’ review during subsequent audits.
The following schedule provides a summary of the fiscal year 2014
recommendations by fiscal area. None of the 18 recommendations were repeated
from the preceding year.
