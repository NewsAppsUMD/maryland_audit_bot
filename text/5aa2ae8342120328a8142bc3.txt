Dear Senator Kasemeyer and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office ofLegislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by the Department
ofHuman Services Office ofthe Secretary (DHS) to resolve the four repeat findings in our June
—
24, 2014 audit report. This review was conducted in accordance with a requirement specified in
the April 2017Joint Chairmen ‘sReport(JCR), page 96. The JCRrequiredthat, priorto the release
of$50,000 ofits administrative appropriationforfiscalyear201$, DHS musttake corrective action
on all repeat audit findings on or before November 1, 2017. The JCR language further provided
that OLA submit a report to the budget committees listing each repeat audit finding along with a
determination that each finding was corrected. The OLA report is required to be submitted to
allow 45 days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior to the end ofthe
fiscal year.
The June 24, 2014 audit report ofDHS contained four repeat audit findings (findings 2, 3,
4, and 7) thatwere addressedby eightrecommendations. This isthe secondyearthat arequirement
regarding repeat audit findings in this audit report has been included in the JCR for DHS. In
response to the requirement in the April 2015 JCR, we notified the budget committees on April
20, 2016 that DHS had resolved four ofthe recommendations relating to findings 2, 4, and 7, and
that four recommendations relating to findings 2 and 3 remained unresolved.
Subsequently, we issued our latest audit report on DHS, dated September 12, 2017, in
which we reviewed the status of all repeat findings from the June 24, 2014 audit report. In our
latest report, we noted that DHS had resolved two of the recommendations relating to original
finding 3, and that two recommendations relating to findings 2 and 3 remained unresolved (which
were renumbered as findings 4 and 5, respectively, in the September 2017 audit report).

In accordance withthe April 2017 JCRrequirement, DHS provided areport to OLA, dated
October 31, 2017, detailing the corrective actions that it had taken with respect to the two repeat
audit findings and recommendations thatwere unresolved as ofthe date ofour September 12,2017
audit report. We reviewed this report to assess the implementation status of these two
recommendations. Our review did not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards.
Exhibit 1 is DHS ‘5 October 31, 2017 status report, which indicated corrective actions had
been takento address the recommendations for the two findings. Our review confirmed that
actions had been taken to resolve those findings.
A summary ofOLA’s assessment ofthe status ofthe two remaining repeat audit findings
and recommendations is included in the attached Exhibit 2. We wish to acknowledge the
cooperation extended to us by DHS during this review.
We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the JCR requirement. Please contact me if
you need additional information.

Exhibit 2 to March 6, 2018 Letter to Joint Chairmen
Status of Repeat Findings in OLA’s June 24, 2014 Audit Report on the
Department of Human Services Office of the Secretary
—
Status Based on
, PriorRecommendations Pertaining toRepeatFmdmgs
OLA Review
Maryland Legal Services Program
2. We recommend that DHS
a. verify that payments made to legal firms are only for Resolved
individuals for whom DH$ is responsible to provide legal
services (for example, require legal firms to submit copies
ofthe court orders appointing the firm as the
representative).
Grants Management
3. We recommend that DHS Resolved
a. independently verify, on a test basis, that grant funds are
spent as intended.
The responsibility for administeringthe specific grantprograms that were commented upon in our DHS audit
report dated June 24, 2014, which related to emergency food and emergency housingprograms, has been
transferred from the DHS Office ofthe Secretary to other units. Specifically, as noted in our DKS audit report
dated September 12, 2017, the Office ofGrants Management (0GM), which administered the emergency food
program was transferred from the DHS Office ofthe Secretaryto the DHS family Investment Administration,
effective July 1, 2015. Subsequently, Chapter 105, 2017 Laws ofMaryland (HB 134) transferred the
responsibility for administeringthe emergency housingprogramsto the Department ofHousingand Community
Development, effective July 1, 2017. Accordingly, since DHS Office ofthe Secretary is no longerresponsible for
the applicable grant programs, forthe purpose ofthis review, we considerthis findingresolved.
