Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
1) Department of Transportation – Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) (12/29/09 – 18
pages – 8 findings)
• Federal funding totaling $2.4 million had not been obtained by MAA because it had not
fulfilled certain requirements relating to its noise compatibility program, which provides
funding for residential sound insulation projects and for the acquisition of properties in
areas exposed to significant aircraft noise.
• MAA did not have procedures to ensure that incentive payments totaling $7.9 million
made to an airline during the audit period were proper.
• MAA did not comply with State travel regulations related to foreign travel. Prices paid
for airline tickets for foreign travel appeared to be excessive. The regulations require
that such tickets are to be purchased with the same care that a prudent person would
entail when traveling for personal reasons.
• Control deficiencies were noted over certain purchasing transactions because some
employees could perform automated functions that allowed them to change transactions
after independent approval.
• MAA’s specifications for an ambulance purchase solicitation appeared to have been
written to favor a particular vendor, in violation of State law. Additionally, inaccurate
information explaining why there was only one bid received in response to this
solicitation was presented to the Board of Public Works.
• Inventories of certain materials and supplies and of sensitive equipment items were not
adequately controlled.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
2) Department of State Police (DSP) (1/20/10 – 26 pages – 14 findings)
• DSP had not taken sufficient action to resolve reimbursable and special fund deficit
balances totaling approximately $7.5 million, the majority of which was identified during
fiscal year 2006.
• DSP lacked adequate procedures and controls to ensure that handguns were only sold
to eligible persons. In addition, DSP did not ensure that required shell casings were
received and entered into the shell casing database for all qualifying handguns sold in
the State.
• DSP did not have adequate procedures to ensure that DNA samples were collected and
forwarded to its Crime Lab for all persons convicted of qualifying crimes. A listing of
correctional facility inmates required to submit a DNA sample was not received from
certain local correctional facilities or the Division of Parole and Probation.
• DSP did not process certain procurements and disbursements in accordance with State
regulations.
• DSP lacked adequate procedures and controls in certain of its offices over collections
and the related billings.
• DSP paid overtime to certain civilian employees in violation of State laws and
regulations and a Governor’s Executive Order. For example, DSP did not obtain the
approval of the Department of Budget and Management to pay monetary overtime
during calendar years 2007 and 2008 totaling $193,300 to 14 employees who were not
eligible to receive such payments.
• Security and controls over key DSP information technology operations need
enhancement. For example, controls over database, password, account, and program
changes for a critical system were insufficient.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
3) University System of Maryland – University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) (2/05/10 – 28
pages – 13 findings)
• UMB made questionable compensation payments to a senior management employee
totaling $410,000, and had not established policies for certain other compensation
payments (such as bonuses) made to other employees. These compensation
payments were in addition to the employees’ regular salaries and were not disclosed in
UMB’s annual budget submissions to the General Assembly. In addition, the
employment agreement for the aforementioned senior management employee was not
submitted to the required entities for approval and/or review.
• UMB did not transfer certain delinquent accounts receivable to the Department of
Budget and Management’s Central Collection Unit timely, and did not always pursue
timely collection of these outstanding accounts.
• Annual contracts with the University of Maryland Medical System Corporation for fiscal
years 2007 through 2009 were executed as much as 23 months after the date required
by State law. Additionally, payments from the Corporation and a local hospital during
fiscal years 2006 to 2009 were not received timely, and UMB did not assess related late
payment fees totaling $121,000.
• Written plans had not been established to address deficit balances totaling $2.9 million
that existed in certain revolving fund accounts.
• Control deficiencies were noted over purchasing and disbursement transactions. In
addition, UMB did not always request Board of Public Works approval for service
contracts in excess of $500,000, as required. Corporate purchasing card transactions
were not always properly reviewed and approved for a former employee who pled guilty
in February 2009 to felony theft of $470,000 from UMB.
• Sufficient access and security controls were not in place over UMB’s network and over
significant computer applications. For example, password controls were inadequate,
significant security events were not always logged, and the internal network was not
properly protected from students and the public.
Recommended Committee Action – None at this time since the report was presented to
budget subcommittees during the 2010 session.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
4) St. Mary’s College of Maryland (2/16/10 – 28 pages – 15 findings)
• The College acquired undeveloped land adjacent to its campus from an individual
affiliated with the College based on an appraisal supplied by the seller, which was
significantly greater in value than the College’s own independent appraisals. Certain
aspects of this sale were not disclosed to the Board of Public Works.
• Purchase orders were frequently prepared after the related invoices had been received,
thus bypassing standard procurement processes designed to ensure that proper
authorizations were obtained and appropriate procurement methods were used.
• The College did not establish adequate procedures to monitor and control expenditures
paid to its food service contractor totaling $11.6 million and funds totaling $1.2 million
that were transferred to an overseas fiduciary responsible for the College’s international
program in Italy.
• Adequate controls were not established over the College’s collections. For example,
independent verifications were not performed to ensure that all recorded collections
were deposited.
• Certain controls over the College’s automated system were not established. For
example, student grade changes were not independently verified and the College did
not timely reconcile its accounting records with the related State accounting records.
Proper security was not instituted over the College’s computer network.
• A written operating agreement had not been executed between the College and its
affiliated foundation.
Recommended Committee Action – None at this time since the report was presented to
budget subcommittees during the 2010 session.

December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
5) Department of General Services – Office of Procurement and Logistics (OPL) (5/05/10 –
18 pages – 7 findings)
• OPL had not ensured that the State’s contract for commercial fuel services, which has
been with the same vendor since 1989, represented the best value to the State. When
the current contract was renewed in 2007, OPL did not perform any analysis to
determine if the renewal was in the State’s best interest. Such an analysis would be
prudent given that the solicitation used by OPL when it last awarded this contract in
2002 included certain restrictive requirements that effectively prohibited other vendors
from being able to compete for the contract.
• OPL did not conduct a market analysis prior to continuing to participate in a multi-state
purchasing alliance for the procurement of pharmaceuticals, and did not take action to
assist State agencies in monitoring the invoiced costs, which totaled $14.2 million
during fiscal year 2009.
• OPL did not ensure that it reviewed and approved State agency contracts for printing
services, as required by State law. According to the State’s accounting records, State
agencies spent approximately $21 million for printing and duplicating services during
fiscal year 2009.
• OPL did not obtain authorization from the Board of Public Works for a significant
contract modification, totaling approximately $750,000, to a vendor that provides energy
and utility usage and bill tracking services for State agencies.
• Control deficiencies were noted over statewide purchasing transactions.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
6) State Board of Elections (SBE) (6/10/10 – 26 pages – 14 findings)
• SBE’s procedures were not sufficient to ensure the propriety of the Statewide voter
registration database. For example, procedures put in place to ensure the propriety of
critical database changes (such as to add or delete voter registrations) processed by
the local boards were not comprehensive, and SBE did not ensure that local boards
removed convicted felons from the voter registration database.
• SBE had not obtained an audit of system controls over the Statewide voter registration
database, even though such an audit is required by SBE’s contract with the system
consultant. Without such an audit, SBE is essentially relying on the contractor’s
assertion that this critical database is secure and properly functioning.
• SBE did not periodically conduct formal comprehensive reviews of the local boards’
compliance with election laws and regulations, such as those related to absentee and
provisional balloting. Although SBE conducted certain oversight activities to help
ensure local board compliance with select laws and regulations, in general, such
procedures were done on an ad hoc basis.
• Unfunded liabilities totaling $2 million were not reported to the Comptroller of Maryland -
General Accounting Division during the fiscal year 2009 budget closeout process.
• SBE’s controls over cash receipts and accounts receivable were seriously deficient. For
example, certain critical duties were not separated and the accounts receivable records
were not properly maintained.
• Control deficiencies were noted over purchases and disbursements because one
employee could initiate and approve certain purchasing and disbursement transactions
without independent approval.
• SBE’s firewall used to help secure its headquarters local area network was not properly
configured or monitored.

7) University System of Maryland (USM) – Coppin State University (CSU) (6/28/10 – 26
pages – 14 findings)
• CSU frequently did not take appropriate actions to collect outstanding student account
balances. Specifically, CSU did not refer delinquent accounts to the State’s Central
Collection Unit in a timely manner, and students with outstanding balances were
permitted to register for classes at CSU in violation of USM’s Board of Regents policy.
As of June 30, 2009, the aggregate balance student accounts receivable records totaled
approximately $4.5 million, of which $2.3 million related to approximately 2,500 student
accounts with balances owed from the Fall 2004 semester through the Fall 2008
semester.
• Sufficient controls were not established over student refunds, non-cash credit
adjustments made to student accounts, student residency status determinations and
subsequent changes, and tuition waivers.
• CSU information systems were not adequately secured. For example, CSU did not
ensure that user access to certain critical system applications was appropriate.
• CSU did not adequately control electronic transfers of certain federal financial aid to
ensure that such funds were properly credited to CSU, and did not always submit
federal reimbursement requests in a timely manner, resulting in lost interest income of
$127,800.
• CSU did not adequately monitor or control corporate purchasing card activity, resulting
in alleged fraudulent activity.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
8) Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) (9/29/10 – 36 pages – 14 findings)
• DJS did not maximize federal Medicaid funding for eligible youth placements in
residential rehabilitation facilities. Primarily, this occurred because DJS did not always
obtain a valid determination of needs assessment for each youth before services were
provided. We estimated that DJS will be unable to recover most, if not all, of federal
Medicaid-eligible claims totaling approximately $3 million for the period from June 2008
to August 2009.
• DJS did not effectively oversee Medicaid reimbursement activity to ensure that only
valid claims were submitted and that all submitted claims were accepted and
reimbursed. In this regard, a Medicaid funding request, totaling approximately $511,600
that was processed in March 2009, was not recovered until almost a year later.
• Significant deficiencies were noted with respect to youth care contract procurement and
monitoring. For example, contractual agreements were not always executed by DJS
prior to the contract start date and were not submitted to the Board of Public Works for
approval. Furthermore, DJS did not monitor or maintain proper cost controls to ensure
payments on certain contracts did not exceed the contract values and did not prepare
contract modifications when contract values were exceeded. With respect to fixed rate
contracts, DJS lacked procedures to determine whether liquidated damages should be
assessed when contractors failed to comply with contract performance provisions, such
as those relating to youth monitoring.
• DJS did not maintain a complete list of youth care contracts and did not have sufficient
procedures to perform audits of youth care contract expenditures.
• DJS did not always timely implement or review youth treatment service plans in
accordance with established policies and State law, and did not always document the
required number of youth supervision contacts and youth progression through the
Violence Prevention Initiative program.
• Access to the automated system for youth case management was not properly
controlled or monitored. Control deficiencies were noted over purchasing and
disbursement transactions and restitution recordkeeping functions.
• Certain employees improperly received overtime compensation or received duplicate
salary payments.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
9) Department of Transportation – Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) (10/13/10 – 26
pages – 13 findings)
• MVA did not verify for completeness the reports used to identify driving records
requiring review to determine whether administrative actions should be taken due to the
number of points accumulated for traffic-related convictions. As a result, MVA did not
always take appropriate administrative actions, such as license suspension or
revocation, against the drivers. In this regard, we identified 139 cases, with 12-point
violations assessed by the courts, which were not subjected to the aforementioned
review. As a result, some of these drivers (for example, 16 of these 20 drivers that we
tested) were allowed to inappropriately retain their driving privileges even though State
law requires revocation of a driver’s license when 12 points are accumulated.
• MVA lacked adequate controls to ensure that proper penalties were recorded and that
suspensions and revocations were properly removed from the driving records.
• A number of deficiencies were noted with respect to MVA’s information systems
security and control. For example, sensitive personal and financial information of
certain eMVA Store customers was not fully protected.
• MVA lacked adequate controls (for example, custodians had access to the related
inventory records) over its inventory of license plates and registration stickers, including
those issued to a contractor for subsequent distribution to certain auto dealerships.
• MVA did not have adequate procedures for the monitoring of Ignition Interlock Program
(IIP) cases. For example, caseworkers were allowed to override the IIP violations
without supervisory review.
• Adequate controls had not been established over certain collections and the processing
of disbursement transactions.
• Independent supervisory reviews were not always performed to ensure the proper
processing of information regarding lapses in insurance coverage.
• MVA did not expand the testing for additional transactions during its internal
investigations of potentially fraudulent activities when possible criminal or unethical
conduct by MVA employees was identified.

December 1, 2009 to October 31, 2010
10) Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services – Baltimore Region (10/29/10 –
24 pages – 10 findings)
• The Region did not maintain critical accounting records for its general working fund and
inmate working fund. Checking account balances were not maintained on a current
basis, and bank reconciliations and fund compositions were either inaccurate or not
prepared at all. Working funds totaling $29,900 were unaccounted for, and the Region
incurred bank fees of $23,300 over a two-year period primarily related to checks written
without sufficient funds on account .
• Inmate fund reconciliations were not being performed of the Region’s records to the
corresponding State records. As of May 31, 2009, total inmate funds per the Region’s
records exceeded the related balance on the State’s records by approximately
$227,000.
• Procedural controls necessary for ensuring the propriety of working fund transactions
and records were either not in place or were ineffective. For example, access to both
the blank general working fund checks and the signature plate was not properly
restricted, and one employee exercised complete control over cash withdrawn from the
inmate working fund.
• The Region periodically transferred funds between the general working fund and inmate
working fund, which impaired accountability for the funds and circumvented the
Comptroller of Maryland’s approval process for establishing the amount authorized for
each working fund. In addition, the Region made certain unsupported and questionable
check disbursements and cash withdrawals from the working funds.
• Procedures and controls relating to the accountability and verification of cash receipts,
which totaled $4.1 million in fiscal year 2009, were not sufficient.
• Payroll adjustments, such as processing overtime worked, were not adequately verified.
• Equipment records were not properly maintained. For example, acquired equipment
was not always recorded in the equipment records and some equipment recorded in the
records could not be located.
