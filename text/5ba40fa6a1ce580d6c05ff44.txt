AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Develop Strategy to Address Going Concern Issue
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (first issued in fiscal year 2016)
The Commission has taken several steps to address the potential going concern issue, including
a detailed review of revenues and expenses and the decision to reduce funding to the retiree reserve by
$33,500 annually, beginning in fiscal year 2018, based on a recent actuarial study. This expense
reduction coupled with the lack of oyster plantings for the Rotational Natural Oyster Harvest Program
(Harvest) resulted in an operating profit for fiscal year 2018. However, there remains the need to use
reserve funds to cover operating expenses as the Commission continues to divert operating funds
received for all oyster licenses and certain commercial licenses to the oyster programs. At the end of
fiscal year 2018, the deficit for restricted funds totaled $221,000, an increase of $76,000 over the fiscal
year 2017 deficit. During fiscal year 2018, the Commission used $168,000 in cash restricted for future
projects to cover operating expenses when there was no operating cash available. As of June 30, 2018,
the Commission had not reimbursed the reserve approximately $142,000 for these funds. The
Commission continues to annually set-aside funds generated from operations to support future oyster
work.
The Commission decided to fund two oyster preservation projects over the past six years, in total
for $400,000, and did not consider the toll these projects would take on operating expenses. They
expected the programs to be self-sustaining; however, even though the Commission is no longer funding
the projects at $50,000 per year each, the Commission also diverted certain revenues, which were
previously used for operating expenses, for these projects. The diverted revenues include all oyster
licenses, surcharges, inspection taxes, identification tags, and the commercial license registration fee
paid by all commercial licensees. This diversion of funds is in violation of the provisions of the Virginia
Potomac River Compact of 1958 (Compact) which clearly indicates that all funds received must be
included in the Commission’s general fund, and only the oyster bushel inspection tax can be designated
for the sole use of planting oyster seed or shell.
While the Commission has recently begun to address this problem, they have not taken any
extraordinary measures with respect to funding future oyster work to bring the situation under control.
The Commission is slowly researching ways to increase revenues; however, they should perform more
stringent reviews of their revenue streams. While they have evaluated where they can reduce expenses,
they continue to fund the oyster programs, diverting all oyster and other commercial license revenues
to the programs. The Commission needs to take a hard line with respect to these revenues and begin
maintaining these license revenues in the operating budget. If there are excess funds at year-end, the
Commission could then consider further funding of the oyster programs. In addition, the Commission
needs to evaluate new projects in light of their mission and purpose, which is the responsibility for
adopting the rules, regulations, and licenses for both commercial and recreational taking, catching, or
attempting to catch fish, crabs, oysters, and clams from the tidal Potomac River waters. The Compact
established the Commission to conserve and improve all valuable fishery resources of the river. While
the preservation of the oyster population is important, concentrating all funding efforts in this area

without regard for other areas of responsibility and the need for funds for ongoing administrative
operations could result in the inability to remain a viable going concern.
Prepare Bank Reconciliations Timely
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (first issued in fiscal year 2016)
During fiscal year 2018, the Commission did not prepare bank reconciliations timely. The
Commission holds six checking/savings accounts, which requires them to complete a total of 72
reconciliations. Prior to February 2018, the Assistant Executive Secretary prepared the reconciliations.
As of February 2018, the procedure changed to require the Executive Secretary to prepare the bank
reconciliations. The Assistant Executive Secretary and the Executive Secretary prepared reconciliations
60 to 90 days after month end for 26 reconciliations or 39 percent.
The Commission policy manual does not outline a timeframe for the completion of the
reconciliations. Best practices suggest that the Commission should complete a reconciliation at least
monthly to ensure that transactions are correct and no fraud has occurred. Without timely reconciliation
of all bank accounts, the Commission increases the risk that unauthorized expenses will occur and that
deposits will not be properly recorded. The Executive Secretary needs to set specific deadlines for
completion of all monthly bank reconciliations and adhere to these deadlines.
Develop Disaster Recovery Plan and Perform Continuity of Operations Testing
Type: Internal Control and Compliance
Repeat: Yes (first issued in fiscal year 2017)
The Commission has made an initial effort to review its disaster recovery plan; however, they
have not yet adopted an applicable security standard and do not have an adequate disaster recovery
plan. The Commission performs daily backups of their servers; however, they have never tested the
backups to ensure the backup is effective. In addition, the Commission stores backups in an unsecure
and unprotected off-site location. Therefore, the backups are subject to damage, destruction, or loss.
The Commission’s disaster recovery plan does not include documented manual workarounds
that will allow the Commission to continue functioning during recovery times after a disaster event. As
a result, the Commission does not perform continuity of operations (COOP) testing. Testing the COOP
is an essential process to verify the Commission can continue performing mission essential business
functions until the restoration of critical information systems. Not periodically testing the COOP to
ensure that employees can efficiently execute roles and responsibilities during an emergency could
potentially delay resuming business operations and may not meet the Commission’s pre-determined
recovery time objective expectations.
The Commission should determine which of the security standards would work best for the size
of their operations and adopt that standard. Based on the adopted standard, the Commission should
develop a robust recovery plan that includes documented manual workarounds and a secure off-site

storage location for backups. In addition, the Commission should begin periodic COOP testing to ensure
operations can continue in the event of a disaster.
Ensure Proper Verification for Employment Eligibility
Type: Internal Control and Compliance
Repeat: No
The Commission does not properly verify employment eligibility for new employees. For two
new hires during fiscal year 2018, the Commission did not properly complete the required Employment
Eligibility Verification forms (I-9), nor did they verify employment eligibility in the E-Verify System. For
all current Commission employees, the prior Fiscal and Human Resource Officer did not properly
complete the I-9 for each new employee and did not verify employees hired after December 1, 2012,
using E-Verify.
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, requires that all employees hired after
November 6, 1986, must have a Form I-9 completed to verify both employment eligibility and identity.
Additionally, §40.1-11.2 of the Code of Virginia requires all agencies of the Commonwealth to use the E-
Verify program for each newly hired employee who is to perform work within the Commonwealth
(effective December 1, 2012). Not complying with federal and state statutes could result in substantial
civil and/or criminal penalties and debarment from government contracts.
The Commission should update their policy manual to include required employment practices.
In addition, the Commission should ensure that the current Fiscal and Human Resource Officer properly
and correctly verifies employment eligibility for all new employees.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the
following sources.
Commission Revenues

2017 2018
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000

Interest and miscellaneous 41,752 28,765
Total revenue $790,589 $836,730
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission’s revenues increased by six percent for fiscal year 2018 due primarily to an
increase in grant funds and an increase in oyster license surcharges for the Reserve program. The
Commission received a private two-year grant totaling $100,000 per year to be used exclusively for
oyster bed construction and seed planting and implemented a new $750 oyster license surcharge. All
other license revenues decreased due to the closing of oyster hand scraping harvest areas and a decrease
in the sale of pleasure boat licenses.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:

Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Retiree health care 53,500 20,000
Total Expenses $874,025 $798,485
Source: Commission’s financial system
Total expenses decreased by nine percent from fiscal year 2017. This is attributable to a 41
percent decrease in oyster seeding expenses due to weather conditions and a 63 percent reduction in
funding of the retiree healthcare trust based on the most recent actuarial study. While overall costs and
decreasing revenues continue to be a concern for the Commission, they are actively seeking ways to
continue to increase profits.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2018 with an operating profit of $43,244, including funding of
the retiree healthcare trust. In addition to reducing the retiree healthcare trust funding by $33,500, the
drastic swing from the operating loss of $84,000 in fiscal year 2017 is attributable to no oyster plantings
for the Harvest program, due to adverse weather conditions, and the implementation of a surcharge in
the Oyster Management Reserve Program (Reserve) to fully cover planting expenses. The Commission
has reserved approximately $320,000 for future plantings in the Harvest program and typically spends
almost $100,000 annually for oyster planting. Had the program planting occurred during fiscal year
2018, the result would have been a potential loss similar to the loss incurred in 2017.
The Commission is retaining less cash overall each year. While the Commission ended the year
with a positive balance of $58,864 in the operating fund as shown in Chart 1, this was the result of using
oyster programs cash reserves. The Commission continues in a deficit situation, because they continue
to use the Harvest program cash reserves, authorized by the Commission in 2013, to pay operating
expenses. For further discussion on this issue, see the finding entitled “Develop Strategy to Address
Going Concern Issue” in the section “Audit Findings and Recommendations.”

Fiscal Year
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission closed fiscal year 2018 with an overall cash balance of $630,555, which was an
eight percent increase ($46,366) over fiscal year 2017 levels. The increase is due to the Commission
paying approximately $57,000 of 2017 expenses in 2018 for the Reserve program. In addition, the
Commission did not have any expenses for plantings in the Harvest program. The cash balance includes
$137,455 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts to fund future oyster work and
$434,236 in a separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree health care reserves. The retiree
healthcare account is managed by a trust and legally cannot be used to fund operations. The Commission
earmarked the other two accounts for the Reserve and Harvest programs, and the Commission should
not use the reserves to supplement operating cash. As shown in Chart 2, as of June 30, 2018, the
Commission’s operating cash coverage continues to decrease due to the Commission’s contributions to
the oyster programs and deflection of other revenues to these programs.

Although the operating account cash balance at year-end was $58,864, the funds are only there
because the Commission borrowed cash from the restricted funds to pay operating costs. The operating
fund owes the restricted funds $142,000 (see Table 3), essentially leaving a negative cash balance in the
operating fund.

Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Thomas K. Norment, Jr.
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2018. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commission’s financial system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls, test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, and review corrective
actions of audit findings from the prior year report.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances.

Operating expenses License revenues
Payroll expenses Grant revenues and expenses
Appropriations
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also tested details of
transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The financial information presented in this report
came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted certain matters involving internal control and its operation and compliance with
applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements that require management’s attention and
corrective action. These matters are described in the section entitled “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.”
The Commission has not taken adequate corrective action with respect to all audit findings
reported in the prior year and; therefore, those findings are repeated in the section entitled “Audit
Findings and Recommendations.”
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on September 6, 2018. Management’s response to
the findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did not
audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
