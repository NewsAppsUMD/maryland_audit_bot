Overview of Repeat Audit Findings
 OLA issues about 50 fiscal compliance audit reports each year containing
about 150 recommendations.
 Virtually all recommendations are accepted by agencies, although there have
been a few recent disagreements.
 As of June 2006, 40% of findings were repeated in the first subsequent audit
report.
 As of June 2020, 28% of findings were repeated in the first subsequent audit
report, indicating significant improvement since 2006. Since 2013, the
overall repeat percentage had been relatively stable, although in the past
three years, the number of repeat findings appears to be rising slightly (See
Exhibit).
 As of June 2020, 8% of findings were repeated after the second subsequent
audit, which represents a slight increase from the previous year.

Follow-up Processes for Repeat Audit Findings
 State Government Article, §2-1224(h) requires agencies with 5 or more
repeat audit findings to provide
• an initial status report to OLA on corrective actions taken on all findings
within 9 months of the related audit reports and, thereafter,
• quarterly status reports until satisfactory progress has been made on all
findings, or until the next audit begins.
 Budget bill language and committee narrative (Joint Chairmen’s Report),
instituted annually since the 2013 Session, has restricted the appropriations
for agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings until
• Corrective action has been taken by the agencies for the repeat findings,
and
• OLA submits reports on its determination regarding the actions taken.

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process
Historical Perspective:
 From 2006 to October 2010, 38 audit reports (involving 28 agencies) had
five or more repeat findings, requiring these agencies to submit quarterly
status reports, which are subject to OLA desk review.
 From October 2010 through December 2016, 4 audit reports had five or
more repeat findings and the status report process has concluded. These 4
audit reports collectively contained 44 report findings (including 23 repeats).
The next audit for each found that 35 of the 44 prior findings were resolved
(only 1 of the original 23 repeats was not corrected).
 During calendar years 2017 and 2018, 4 audit reports had five or more
repeat findings and have also been subject to the more comprehensive JCR
follow-up process and/or the OLA follow-up review process for agencies with
unsatisfactory ratings. Subsequent audits have been finalized for 3 of the 4
agencies, with these audits showing a general improvement in repeat audit
findings, although 1 of the audits will again be subject to the JCR follow-up
process.

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process (cont.)
 During calendar year 2019, 1 audit report (MDH – DDA) had five or more
repeat findings and was subject to an OLA follow-up review process for
agencies with unsatisfactory ratings. This report is also subject to the
quarterly status report process which recently started. One additional audit
report (DGS – OPL) had five or more repeat findings and will also be subject
to the more comprehensive JCR follow-up process. The quarterly status report
process is also in progress.
 During calendar year 2020, as of November 2020, no audit reports issued
had five or more repeat findings.

JCR Follow-up Process - Background
 Beginning with the April 2013 Joint Chairmen’s Report, in response to JAC
concerns, the Chairmen of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and
the House Appropriations Committee instituted a process to restrict funding
for agencies with four or more repeat audit findings, until the submission of a
report by OLA on the status of related corrective actions.
 The annual amount of funds restricted for each agency generally is
$100,000, but has recently ranged from $50,000 to $250,000.
 The determination of whether to release funding is at the sole discretion of
the budget committees.

JCR Follow-up Process – Recent Results
 The April 2019 Joint Chairmen’s Report (JCR) did not contain any budget
language restrictions related to OLA audit findings.
 The April 2020 JCR contained budget bill language restrictions for two
agencies with four or more repeat audit findings (see chart on page 8).
• In November 2020, OLA sent out letters to the two agencies reminding
them of the need to submit the required reports. At the time this
presentation document was prepared, a report from one agency had been
received.
• OLA will review these reports and will report our conclusions regarding the
corrective actions taken on the collective nine repeat findings to the budget
committees. The budget committees have 45 days from the date of the
receipt of the report to review and comment to allow for funds to be
released prior to the end of fiscal year 2021.

JCR Follow-up – PII Audit Findings
 In addition to the two agencies previously identified, the April 2020 JCR
contained budget language restrictions for three agencies that had repeat
findings on the failure to safeguard personally identifiable information (PII) in
their audit reports issued in 2019.
 The State Treasurer’s Office, the Department of Budget and Management, and
the State Department of Education each had $100,000 in general fund
appropriation for administration withheld until:
• they meet with the State Chief Information Security Officer (SCISO) to
identify and document a path to resolve the findings;
• SCISO submits a report to OLA by February 1, 2021 addressing corrective
actions taken to protect PII, a path and timeline for resolving any
outstanding issues, and any ongoing costs associated with corrective
actions; and
• OLA reviews the actions identified and determines that they demonstrate
the agencies’ commitment to correct each repeat. OLA shall report its
results to the budget committees and JAEC by May 1, 2021.
 OLA has not received the SCISO’s report.

Conclusion
 We believe that the various follow-up processes provide useful tools to
compel State agencies to generally take meaningful corrective action to
implement audit recommendations.
 Since 2006, the overall percentage of repeat audit findings has decreased
from 40% to 28% in 2020. While the percentage of repeat findings had
remained virtually unchanged for several years, starting in 2018 the number
and percentage of repeat findings have again started to increase slightly.
