Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Property Tax Assessment Appeals Boards consist of the local boards, which
have been established in the 24 local jurisdictions to hear appeals of property tax
assessments, and an administrative office located in Hagerstown. Each local
board consists of three members, and in most jurisdictions one alternate member,
who are appointed by the Governor for five-year terms. According to the State's
records, the Boards’ fiscal year 2015 operating expenditures totaled
approximately $1.0 million and primarily consisted of local Boards’ expenses.
Findings and Recommendations
Assessment Appeals Hearings
Finding 1
The Boards had a significant backlog of 9,717 appeals cases awaiting
hearings as of December 2015.
Analysis
The Boards had a backlog of 9,717 property tax assessment appeals cases
awaiting hearings as of December 2015, primarily in Baltimore City and Prince
George’s County which had backlogs of 6,058 and 2,129 cases, respectively. As
shown in the table below, the number of cases received and the related backlog
increased significantly during calendar year 2015. Specifically, the Boards
received 15,833 appeals during calendar year 2015 and heard 10,898 cases, with
additional cases being either settled or withdrawn during the year.
Certain local boards, such as the

within a specified period from the date it is filed, the backlog could result in long
delays for property owners.
In addition to the significant increase in appeals received, Board management
advised us that the backlog was the result of a delay in local jurisdictions
recommending new appointees to the Governor to fill local assessment appeals
board vacancies.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that the Boards develop a strategy for eliminating the
backlog of appeals cases awaiting hearings, particularly those in Baltimore
City and Prince George’s County.
Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Property Tax Assessment
Appeals Boards for the period beginning July 30, 2012 and ending November 11,
2015. The audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine the Boards’
financial transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance
with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included maintenance of payroll records and appeals case
management.
Our audit did not include a review of certain support services provided to the
Boards by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation. These support
services (such as payroll processing, purchasing, maintenance of accounting
records, and related fiscal functions) are included within the scope of our audits of
the Department.

To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, observations of the
Boards’ operations, and tests of transactions. Generally, transactions were
selected for testing based on auditor judgment, which primarily considers risk.
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, neither statistical nor non-statistical audit
sampling was used to select the transactions tested. Therefore, the results of the
tests cannot be used to project those results to the entire population from which
the test items were selected.
We also performed various data extracts of pertinent information from the State’s
Financial Management Information System (such as revenue and expenditure
data) and the State’s Central Payroll Bureau (payroll data). The extracts are
performed as part of ongoing internal processes established by the Office of
Legislative Audits and were subject to various tests to determine data reliability.
We determined that the data extracted from these various sources were
sufficiently reliable for the purposes the data were used during this audit. Finally,
we performed other auditing procedures that we considered necessary to achieve
our audit objectives. The reliability of data used in this report for background or
informational purposes was not assessed.
The Boards’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes a finding relating to a condition that we consider to be a
significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect the Boards’ ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. Our audit did not disclose any significant instances of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.

The Boards’ response to our finding and recommendation is included as an
appendix to this report. As prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2-
1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we will advise the Boards regarding the
results of our review of its response.
