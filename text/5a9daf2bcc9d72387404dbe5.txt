Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
1) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Medical Care Programs Administration
(MCPA) (12/06/10 – 36 pages – 14 findings)
• MCPA’s policies and procedures for determining applicant eligibility for participation in
the Medical Assistance Program were not comprehensive and longstanding deficiencies
in the eligibility process and related monitoring have not been corrected. These
conditions occurred, at least in part, because the memorandum of understanding
between the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Department of Human
Resources, which performs certain eligibility determination responsibilities for the
Program, was generally outdated and lacked important provisions.
• MCPA did not sufficiently verify data (that is, medical services provided to enrollees)
that were factored into the computation of capitation (per person) rates paid to managed
care organizations participating in the HealthChoice program, which enroll about 70
percent of Medicaid recipients.
• MCPA lacked adequate procedures over claims paid for Medicaid recipients who also
had Medicare coverage (Medicare crossover claims). MCPA also did not ensure that
claims adjustments were subject to independent supervisory review and approval.
• MCPA used inmates for data entry of sensitive claims information, including social
security numbers, and did not ensure a contractor that also performed data entry had
obtained the required criminal background checks for its employees. (Policy Issue)
• Certain healthcare provider applications were not subject to adequate supervisory
review and approval.
• MCPA did not have procedures in place to ensure that drug prices paid for pharmacy
reimbursements under the Maryland Medicaid Pharmacy Program were reasonable.
Such payments totaled $271 million during fiscal year 2009.
• MCPA did not adequately account for cost settlements from long-term care facilities to
ensure that all cost settlements were conducted as required. As of April 2010, there
were 246 cost settlements that were not issued within the one year required period.
• MCPA did not fully correct procedures and control deficiencies, which contributed to a
$1.8 million fraud in the Kidney Disease Program.
• Procedures were not sufficient to ensure the proper use of Transportation Grant
Program funds. Payments under this Program totaled $32.5 million during fiscal year
2009.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
2) Department of General Services (DGS) (1/06/11 – 24 pages – 7 findings)
• DGS did not verify the propriety of certain data used and assumptions made by energy
service companies to calculate State facility energy usage under energy performance
contracts (EPC). DGS also did not verify whether guaranteed cost savings reported by
energy service companies in measurement and verification (M&V) reports were
realized.
As of May 31, 2010, there were 14 EPC’s statewide in the construction and M&V
contract phases, costing $165 million, which included fees totaling $5.6 million for
annual M&V services to be rendered by the companies.
• DGS could not adequately support its decision to pay an energy service company for
certain required M&V services that were not performed and it did not request approval
from the Board of Public Works to modify the related contract.
• DGS permitted certain energy service companies to use M&V methods that did not
appear to be supported by federal guidelines and industry protocols.
• DGS lacked adequate controls for the issuance and recovery of State identification (ID)
cards. For example, there was no supervisory review of ID cards issued to ensure that
the cards were issued only to authorized individuals.
• DGS did not formally document its decision regarding seeking the recovery of costs
incurred due to project design errors or omissions by contractors. DGS processed
construction change orders totaling approximately $1.2 million that it attributed to
contractor design errors and omissions.
• DGS inappropriately accrued certain revenues totaling approximately $549,000, and
lacked documentation to support certain accrued expenditures totaling approximately $1
million.
• DGS did not maintain its equipment and related records in accordance with State
regulations. According to its detail equipment records, as of June 30, 2010, the value of
DGS equipment totaled approximately $10.3 million

November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
3) Department of Human Resources – Office of the Secretary and Related Units (DHR)
(1/11/11 – 20 pages – 9 findings)
• The United States Department of Health and Human Services disallowed $9.6 million in
certain Title IV-E expenditures because there was no provision for those expenditures in
DHR’s cost allocation plan. Consequently, the expenditures, which were paid with State
general funds, will not be reimbursed.
• Adequate procedures had not been established to ensure that payments made to legal
firms on behalf of indigent individuals, such as adults in Adult Protective Services
proceedings, were proper and that the firms provided the related services. Such
payments totaled $16.1 million during fiscal year 2009.
• DHR did not adequately monitor grant expenditures, which totaled $30 million in fiscal
year 2009, to ensure that the funds were spent and services were performed in
accordance with the grant agreements. For example, although grantees are required to
provide expenditure reports on a regular basis, DHR did not independently verify the
accuracy of these reports.
• DHR circumvented the State procurement process by allowing a contractor to purchase
450 computers on its behalf, at a total cost of approximately $850,000, without soliciting
competitive bids. Consequently, DHR had no assurance that the computers were
purchased at the lowest cost to the State.
• DHR did not establish adequate controls over its information systems. For example,
DHR did not independently review the propriety of actions taken by users with
unrestricted access to electronic benefit and payment menu screens in the Clients'
Automated Resource and Eligibility System.
• Adequate accountability and control was not established over equipment. For example,
differences between the physical inventories and the related detail records were not
adequately investigated and resolved. As of February 2010, there were 42,433 missing
items, including sensitive items such as computer equipment, with a total cost of $27.5
million.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
4) Department of Human Resources – Family Investment Administration (2/09/11 – 24
pages – 8 findings)
• FIA did not ensure that that the results of computer matches performed to help verify
eligibility for assistance programs such as Temporary Cash Assistance were
investigated and resolved by the local departments of social services (LDSSs) in a
timely and adequate manner. For example, as of May 2010, FIA had identified
approximately 28,700 instances of a missing or unverified social security number
relating to active or pending public assistance cases, 2,600 of which had remained
unresolved for over a year. FIA estimated that FY 2010 DHR benefit payments to the
related individuals totaled $3.4 million
• FIA lacked assurance that LDSSs complied with quality assurance program
requirements in a timely and complete manner. These requirements were implemented
to assess LDSS performance and to identify and address errors that may have occurred
when processing applications. Also, due to the State’s error rates exceeding certain
national performance measures, sanctions of $423,563 were imposed by the federal
government.
• FIA did not use available matching procedures to help verify critical information
submitted by applicants for energy assistance program benefits, which totaled
approximately $150 million during fiscal year 2010. Furthermore, adequate
documentation of data used to help determine the amount of benefits due an applicant
was not always obtained.
• FIA had not established adequate controls over the automated data management
system used to process applications for energy assistance and to calculate benefit
amounts due. Also, controls over refunds of energy assistance benefits received from
utility companies, which totaled approximately $5.3 million during fiscal year 2010, were
not sufficient.
• FIA did not verify that individuals receiving Temporary Disability Assistance Program
(TDAP) benefits for an extended period were pursuing federal benefits as required.
TDAP benefits, which are entirely State funded and totaled approximately $41.6 million
during fiscal year 2010, are discontinued once federal benefits are approved and
initiated by the Social Security Administration.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
5) Office of the Public Defender (OPD) (2/10/11 – 18 pages – 7 findings)
• OPD policies and procedures for determining client financial eligibility for its legal
services were not sufficiently comprehensive. OPD policies did not require applicants to
provide supporting documentation for reported expenses used to determine the
applicant’s ability to pay for legal representation and did not define situations when an
independent verification of an applicant’s financial status would be warranted. Also,
eligibility determinations were not always properly supported and were not subject to
supervisory review.
• OPD lacked adequate procedures to ensure administrative and court-ordered fees due
from clients were recorded in the accounts receivable records and were pursued for
collection. For example, according to OLA’s analysis, OPD failed to record and/or
pursue collection of administrative fees for 40,000 cases opened during fiscal year 2010
totaling an estimated $1.9 million.
• OPD did not assess administrative fees on certain applicants and did not have
procedures to ensure clients were billed for certain court-ordered fees. For example,
OLA estimated that OPD did not assess administrative fees totaling $78,400 to
applicants who were denied services even though State regulations provide that the fee
shall be assessed for these applicants.
• OPD did not properly segregate accounts receivable duties and did not require
independent approval for critical transactions. As of June 30, 2010, accounts receivable
related to administrative fees and court-ordered reimbursements totaled $19.4 million
and $3.9 million, respectively.
• OPD did not remove two employees from the payroll in a timely manner and improperly
calculated the unused annual leave balance paid to six employees on termination of
employment resulting in overpayments totaling approximately $66,000.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
6) Department of Human Resources – Social Services Administration (SSA) (3/16/11 – 20
pages – 6 findings)
• Certain information recorded in the Children’s Electronic Social Services Information
Exchange (CHESSIE), SSA’s automated child welfare information system, was
incomplete and unreliable. As a result, SSA has not been able to use CHESSIE’s
investigation module to effectively monitor child welfare activities performed by the
LDSSs, such as the timeliness of investigations performed for allegations of child abuse
and neglect. This condition also resulted in the reporting of certain unreliable data to
the federal government.
• SSA did not establish procedures to effectively monitor foster and kinship care
placements to ensure that children were not placed with certain providers, as required
by State regulations. OLA’s review identified 6 foster care providers who had cared for
32 children even though there was credible evidence of child abuse or neglect against
the provider prior to, or during, these placements.
• SSA did not ensure compliance with certain foster care service requirements, such as
annual medical exams for foster care children.
• SSA did not achieve the required 90 percent success rate for any of the seven outcome
measures in the federal Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) dated January 2010.
• SSA did not have a process in place to ensure that annual reports from group home
providers detailing the disposition of overpayments they retained from prior years were
obtained. According to SSA’s records, overpayments to 55 providers in fiscal year 2008
totaled $5.8 million.
• SSA did not have a process in place to obtain supporting documentation for invoices
related to contracts totaling $3.4 million that SSA entered into with a State university.
Under the terms of the contracts, payments to the university were to be based on the
actual time and materials spent by the university.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
7) Department of Transportation – State Highway Administration (SHA) – Possible
Conflicts of Interest Involving Certain Construction – Related Contracts (Special)
(6/24/11 – 18 pages – 5 findings)
• A senior SHA Office of Construction (OOC) management employee appeared to have
solicited funds for a charity event hosted by the employee’s company from firms doing,
or seeking to do, business with SHA, potentially violating State Ethics Laws, a
Governor’s Executive Order, and SHA policies. The employee’s financial relationship
with these firms is significant because some of these firms had ongoing contracts with
SHA, which were procured, in part, by this employee’s unit (OOC). Two of these firms
were each awarded a $16 million contract for construction management and inspection
services shortly before the event.
• A former senior management employee was hired by a firm doing business with SHA
within 12 days of retirement and subsequently worked on an SHA contract that, as an
employee, this individual had helped to procure. This condition may have violated State
Ethics Laws, as well as SHA’s ethics policies and contract provisions.
• SHA did not ensure that firms doing business with SHA complied with State Ethics Laws
and SHA policies regarding the hiring of former State employees. SHA made no
attempts to identify these former employees and/or ensure that their employment was
not violating ethics requirements.
• SHA’s procurement of two $16 million contracts circumvented certain established
independent bid evaluation processes and the procurement was not adequately
documented. For example, the Office of Procurement and Contracts (OPC) did not
perform a complete rating of the technical proposals and SHA did not document how
disparities in the evaluation of technical proposals by OPC and OOC were resolved.
• SHA solicited the cooperation of the two aforementioned firms to redirect contract funds
from the two $16 million contracts for unrelated projects, thereby circumventing Board of
Public Works oversight and approval. SHA solicited the cooperation of these two firms
through correspondence which requested the firms to provide services that were not
within the defined scope of their BPW-approved contracts and instructed the firms how
to submit their invoices to facilitate the payments.

November 1, 2010 to August 31, 2011
8) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA)
(7/12/11 – 20 pages – 8 findings)
• MHA lacked adequate procedures for ensuring that documentation supporting patient
eligibility for services paid entirely by the State’s General Fund (uninsured coverage)
was obtained and verified. Although MHA contracted with an Administrative Service
Organization (ASO) to review patient eligibility, these reviews did not target uninsured
coverage claims nor did they include a review of supporting documentation when such
claims were examined. Payments for uninsured coverage totaled approximately $20
million between September 2009 and June 2010.
• An automated data match between death records of the Social Security Administration
(SSA) and MHA claim payment records disclosed questionable recipient data and claim
payments. In particular, the match disclosed 106 individuals whose social security
numbers matched those of deceased individuals. For these individuals, claims totaling
approximately $207,000 were paid for services rendered after their dates of death as
indicated by SSA’s records.
• Certain independent reviews of claims processed by the ASO have not been performed
since March 2009. These reviews served as a primary means for testing the accuracy
and propriety of processed claims, which totaled approximately $472 million between
September 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010.
• MHA’s contract with the ASO lacked specific provisions needed to obligate the vendor
to address certain significant information technology security and operational risks,
including risks over sensitive data.
• Certain security and control deficiencies were noted with regard to the ASO’s
information systems used to process MHA transactions. For example, a default user
account allowed unnecessary modification access to many system files.
• MHA did not adequately monitor contracts established by local Core Service Agencies
(CSAs) with independent vendors to provide mental health services to local jurisdictions
throughout the State. During fiscal year 2010, MHA awarded approximately $63.8
million to the 20 CSAs.

9) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Office of the Secretary and Other Units
(DHMH) (8/09/11 – 24 pages – 10 findings)
• DHMH lacked adequate procedures and controls over vital records, resulting in a lack of
assurance that all birth record information recorded on the vital records system was
accurate and that related certificates were only issued to authorized recipients. Also,
DHMH did not reconcile the number of certificates issued to the related fees collected
and deposited and did not generate output reports of certificates issued for use in such
reconciliations. During fiscal year 2010, DHMH’s Division of Vital Records collected
approximately $4.9 million for the issuance of approximately 413,000 certified copies of
certificates.
• DHMH did not properly monitor local health department (LHD) procedures and controls
over birth and death certificates. Critical vital record and cash receipts duties were not
properly segregated at certain LHDs, and an employee at one LHD allegedly issued
birth certificates for which the related collections had not been recorded and/or
accounted for, resulting in a DHMH investigation and referral of the case to the Office of
the Attorney General’s Criminal Division. During fiscal year 2010, the LHD’s collected
approximately $2.1 million for the issuance of approximately 185,000 certificates.
• DHMH did not properly or timely perform financial investigations of patients enrolled in
State facilities to determine their ability to pay for the cost of care and/or to identify other
liable parties. The cost of services provided cannot be billed to the patients or to
appropriate liable third parties, when appropriate, until the financial investigations are
completed.
• DHMH did not always adequately pursue delinquent accounts receivable for collection
and/or transfer the accounts to the Department of Budget and Management’s Central
Collection Unit (CCU) as required. According to DHMH records as of March 31, 2010,
there were 672 accounts totaling approximately $10 million that were outstanding for
more than 120 days.
• DHMH did not expand testing of pharmacy claims and take sufficient corrective action
when significant errors were identified during audits of pharmacies participating in the
Maryland Pharmacy Program. According to DHMH records, during fiscal year 2009,
1,120 pharmacies were paid $271 million for claims and 161 pharmacies were audited
with recommended recoveries of approximately $43,000.
