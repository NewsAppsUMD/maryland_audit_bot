Dear Senator Kasemeyer and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office ofLegislative Audits (OLA) has conducted a review ofthe actions taken by the
Department of Human Resources (DHR) Local Department Operations (LDO) to resolve five
—
repeat findings in our July 24, 2015 audit report. This review was conducted in accordance with
a requirement specified in the April 2016 Joint Chairmen ‘s Report (JCR), page 81. The JCR
required that, prior to the release of $100,000 of its administrative appropriation for fiscal year
2017, DHR must report on the corrective actions taken with respect to all repeat findings on or
before January 1, 2017. The JCRlanguage furtherprovided that OLA submit a reportto the budget
committees listing each repeat audit finding along with an assessment of the corrective actions
taken by DHR for each repeat finding. The OLA report is required to be submitted to allow 45
days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior to the end ofthe fiscal year.
The LDO audit report dated July 24, 2015 contained five repeat findings (findings 1, 4, 5,
7, and 8). In accordance with the April 2016 JCR requirement, DHR provided a report to OLA,
dated January 1, 2017, detailing the corrective actions that it had taken with respect to these repeat
audit findings. We reviewed this report and related documentation, performed limited tests and
analyses ofthe information, and held discussions with DHR personnel as necessary to assess the
corrective actions taken for each finding. Our review did not constitute an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Exhibit 1 is DHR’s January 1, 2017 status report, which indicated that corrective actions
had been taken to address one finding and, for the remaining four findings, that corrective actions
were ongoing. Our review determined that DHR had taken the necessary actions to satisfactorily
address one ofthe five findings and is in the process ofimplementing corrective actions to address
certain recommendations for the remaining four findings. A summary of OLA’s assessment of
the corrective actions taken by DHRfor each ofthe repeat audit findings is included inthe attached
Exhibit 2.

Delegate Maggie McIntosh, Chair
The LDO findings contained in OLA’s audit report were primarily based on findings
contained in audit reports issued by DHR’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) which, in
accordance with State law, performs a financial and compliance audit ofeach local department of
social services (LDSS) at least once every three years. While DHR’s status report and our review
disclosed that new monitoring procedures were planned or in place to help resolve certain ofthese
LDSS findings, the success of these new processes will not be fully known until each LDSS
receives its first OIG audit after the implementation ofthese monitoring procedures. Over time,
DHR’s success in reducing LDSS audit findings will become clearer.
Exhibit 3 contains a summary of LDSS audit findings from reports issued by OIG
subsequent to the period included in our last LDO audit. Specifically, OIG issued 15 LDSS audit
reports during the period from January 2015 through December 2016. The OIG results for those
LDSSs were comparable for both the total number offindings and repeat findings (30 percent) to
those presented in our preceding audit report. As previously mentioned, most ofthe related OIG
audit work occurred before DRR had implemented the recommended corrective actions from our
LDO audit. We will formally assess the status ofthese findings in our next audit ofLDO, which
is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2018.
After discussing our review results, DHR generally agreed with the accuracy of the
information presented. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us by DHR during
this review.
We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the JCR requirement. Please contact me if
you need additional information.
Sincerely,
Thomas Barnickel III, CPA

Exhibit 2 to April 4, 2017 Letter to the Joint Chairmen
OLA’s Assessment of Corrective Actions Taken by the Department of Human
Resources
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 1
—
We recommend that DHR (that is, the Office ofthe Secretary and the management ofDHR
administrations) establish a process to actively monitor corrective actions taken to address
OIG audit findings.
Assessment ofCorrective Action: Completed
DHR established a Corrective Action Monitoring and Resolution task force to address the Office
ofInspector General (OIG) audit findings. The task force comprises the directors ofeach DHR
administration and an LDS$ director. The task force has held biweekly meetings with the OIG
since April 2015 during which the task force reviewed OIG audit findings and the related
corrective actions taken to ensure they were adequate.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 4
—
We recommend that DHR establish appropriate accountability and control over fiscal
operations. Specifically, DHR should ensure that the LDSSs
a. establish adequate controls over bank accounts and blank check inventories, including
the timely preparation of account reconciliations and resolution ofoutstanding checks;
b. comply with State procurement regulations; and
c. establish proper accountability over prepaid gift cards.
Assessment of Corrective Action: In progress
a. DHR implemented processes designed to ensure LDSSs establish adequate controls over
bank accounts and blank check inventories. DHR hired a contractor to conduct bank
reconciliation training for the LDSS finance officers. The training included the proper
preparation ofbank reconciliations, related controls over check signers, and the physical
security over checks. On a quarterly basis, DHR’s Accounting Operations Unit reviews the
LDSSs’ bank reconciliations and ensures there are no checks outstanding for extended
periods. DHR completed its first quarterly review in January 2017. The review identified 15
LD$Ss with no findings and 9 LDSSs with findings. At the time ofour review, DHR was in
the process offollowing up on these findings with the LDSSs.
b. DHR has increased training in the areas ofprocurement noncompliance, including the
appropriate use ofdirect vouchers; however, DHR has not implemented any procurement
monitoring procedures to determine whether the training is effective and the proper
procurement methods are being used.

--- Page 10 ---
c. DHR has not established accountability over prepaid gift cards. DHR’s status report noted
that it would provide internal training and centralized monitoring ofgift cards. As of
February 2017, DHR had not initiated any training or monitoring.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 5
—
We recommend that DUR ensure that the LDSSs comply with all Family Investment
Administration program requirements. Specifically, DHR should ensure that the LDSSs
a. establish appropriate controls over the EBT card inventories,
b. perform supervisory reviews on the required number of case files, and
c. perform timely follow-up on all potential payment or eligibility errors identified by the
01G.
Assessment ofCorrective Action: In progress
a. The Family Investment Administration’s (FIA) Audit Task Force convened a meeting in
October 2015 to establish best practices for the EBT cards. The task force developed eleven
action items ofwhich four were completed and seven are still in process. The four
completed action items include establishing appropriate controls over EBT card inventories,
such as additional monitoring over the inventory process. The remaining seven action items
focus on new standard operating procedures to provide additional guidance to the LDSSs.
b. The FIA Bureau ofProgram Evaluation performed quarterly reviews ofeach LDSS
beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to determine ifan appropriate number
ofsupervisory reviews were conducted and notified each LDSS ofthe results in writing.
While this process was designed to identify instances in which the required number of
supervisory reviews were not being performed, the process did not include a mechanism to
ensure compliance with the review requirements or establish a mechanism for establishing
accountability to ensure supervisory reviews are performed.
c. On a monthly basis beginning in July 2016, FIA’s Bureau ofProgram Evaluation reviewed
the LDSSs’ efforts to follow up on all potential payment or eligibility errors identified by the
OIG, and notified each LDSS ofthe results in writing. The Bureau’s latest review, as of
March 2017, disclosed 11 LDSSs with outstanding potential errors, while 13 LDSSs had no
outstanding potential errors at that time. Results ofthe review were communicated to the
LDSSs, and we were advised by DHR management that DHR’s central office staffwill
follow up on the errors ifnot addressed by the LDSSs.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 7

information system access. Specifically, DHR should ensure that the LDSSs
a. maintain a properly completed and approved authorization form for all user accesses
granted, and assign access capabilities appropriate to each employee’s job duties; and

b. perform formal, periodic monitoring ofemployee system access and promptly delete the
access offormer employees.
Assessment of Corrective Action: In progress
a. While DHR now provides mandatory security monitor training, DHR did not implement any
procedures to help ensure that the LDSS maintained a completed and approved authorization
form for all user accesses granted, and that assigned access capabilities were appropriate for
each employee’s duties.
b. DHR implemented procedures to ensure that LDSSs promptly deleted the access offormer
employees and provided security monitor training; however, DHR did not implement
procedures to ensure that the LDSSs performed formal, periodic monitoring ofemployee
system access.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 8
—
We recommend that DHR ensure that the Bureau ofLong-Term Care properly performs
Medicaid eligibility determinations.
Assessment ofCorrective Action: In Progress
DHR has increased Medicaid eligibility determination training for its Bureau ofLong-Term Care
employees and has established new protocols in certain areas, such as document management.
However, DHR only verifies the propriety ofthe determinations through triennial OIG audits
and, as ofMarch 2017, no audits had been conducted since July 2014.
