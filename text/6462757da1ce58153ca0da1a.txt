Dear Senator Guzzone and Delegate Barnes:
The Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by
the Department of Human Services (DHS) Social Services Administration (SSA)
to resolve the repeat findings in our June 3, 2021 audit report. This review was
conducted in accordance with a requirement specified in the April 2022 Joint
Chairmen’s Report (JCR), page 131. The JCR required that, prior to the release
of $100,000 of its administrative appropriation for fiscal year 2023, DHS must
take corrective action on all repeat audit findings on or before November 1, 2022.
The JCR language further provided that OLA submit a report to the budget
committees listing each repeat audit finding along with a determination that each
finding was corrected. The OLA report is required to be submitted to allow 45
days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior to the end of
the fiscal year.
Before summarizing the JCR follow-up results, we would like to draw
your attention to an earlier July 2022 OLA follow-up of the original June 3, 2021
SSA audit report, which contained seven repeat audit findings (Findings 1, 2, 3, 4,

--- Page 2 ---
Senator Guy J. Guzzone, Chair -2- May 15, 2023
Delegate Benjamin S. Barnes, Chair
5, 7 and 8) that were addressed by thirteen recommendations. In that original
report, we concluded that SSA’s accountability and compliance rating was
unsatisfactory. As a result of that unsatisfactory rating, we subsequently performed
our first follow-up review, whereby we evaluated the status of six of the findings
(including five repeat findings) from the June 3, 2021 audit report. In our resultant
special follow-up review report, dated July 6, 2022, we concluded that SSA had
resolved three findings (including repeat Findings 4 and 7), and had made progress,
but had not resolved three other findings (repeat findings 1, 2, and 3) subject to
review.
In accordance with the April 2022 JCR requirement, DHS provided a report
to OLA, dated November 1, 2022, detailing certain corrective actions that had been
completed and actions that were ongoing with respect to all seven repeat audit
findings contained in the June 3, 2021 SSA audit report (Exhibit 1). In accordance
with our policy, we have redacted the names of any vendors, DHS employees, or
products mentioned by DHS in the original document.
We reviewed the DHS status report and related documentation, performed
limited tests and analyses of the information, and held discussions with SSA
personnel as necessary to assess the implementation status of the related
recommendations. As Findings 4 and 7 were determined to be resolved during our
aforementioned July 2022 follow-up review, our current review was limited to
determining the status of repeat Findings 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. Our review did not
constitute an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Based on our current review, we determined that SSA resolved
Finding 2, but had not taken sufficient actions to correct Findings 1, 3, 5, and 8.
Specifically, although DHS had implemented certain elements of the
recommendations related to Findings 1, 3, 5, and 8, the actions to date did not
address the entirety of the findings (Exhibit 2). Consequently, at the time of our
review, our assessment of Findings 1, 3, 5, and 8 concluded that they were still in
progress. (Exhibit 3).
Although SSA management did not disagree with the factually accuracy of
the results of OLA’s review it did disagree with the conclusion of, “Not Resolved”
for Finding 5. SSA management advised that it was unaware that to fully resolve
this finding that it would need to provide a disposition in terms of active or closed
cases for the children that entered care before 2016. We wish to acknowledge the
cooperation extended to us during the review by DHS. We also wish to
acknowledge DHS’ willingness to address the audit issues and implement
appropriate corrective actions.

and an update provided. Of the three cases identified, one
case was incorrectly showing an amount due to a system

OLA’s Assessments Regarding Repeat Findings and Recommendations That
Were Not Resolved
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 1
We recommend that SSA establish comprehensive quality assurance processes to ensure its
child welfare programs are effectively and properly administered by LDSSs. Specifically,
we recommend that SSA modify its existing processes to ensure that they provide
a. comprehensive written procedures for monitoring program services and functions to
ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies; appropriate and
timely recordkeeping; and the maintenance of supporting documentation relating to
services and functions performed (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that SSA developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for monitoring
the LDSSs, but as of March 2023 the SOPs had not been finalized.
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 3
We recommend that SSA
a. establish effective procedures to ensure that LDSSs conduct and complete investigations
of allegations of child abuse and neglect and safety and risk assessments of controlled
substance-exposed newborns in a timely manner, as required by State law and
regulation (repeat); and
b. enhance the accuracy and completeness of system reports to ensure they can be reliably
used to monitor compliance with these requirements (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that SSA developed an SOP for monitoring the LDSSs, along with
monitoring guidance, but as of March 2023, these had not been finalized and issued to the
LDSSs (as we noted in our assessment of prior finding 1). As of March 2023, SSA was
finalizing a substance-exposed newborn monitoring report, and validating the data with the
LDSSs. SSA advised that it intended to begin issuing notifications of noncompliance to the
LDSSs for substance-exposed newborns on March 15, 2023.
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 5
We recommend that SSA ensure federal reimbursement is obtained for all children eligible
for Title IV-E funding. Specifically we recommend that SSA
c. review all children who are currently determined to be ineligible due to a missing court
order or who entered care prior to July 2016 (and received services within the last two
years), including the aforementioned cases, and obtained Title IV-E funds when
possible (repeat).

Exhibit 3 to May 15, 2023 Letter to the Joint Chairmen
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that SSA developed a process on a test basis to review children who were
recently determined ineligible for federal reimbursement because they were missing a court
order. SSA asserted that it performed a 100 percent review of all active cases, including those
that were still active that had entered care prior to July 2016. Although SSA was able to provide
us with documentation that certain cases were reviewed, it could not readily provide
documentation that the aforementioned 100 percent review was done or how many of the 3,626
cases mentioned in the prior audit report were included in this review. Specifically, SSA
management advised us that it was unaware that all cases noted in the prior report, regardless of
current status should have been reviewed to resolve the prior report recommendation.
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 8
We recommend that SSA implement a process to ensure the propriety of State university
invoices. For example, obtain and review payroll records or restructure the agreements to
base payment on specific deliverables to be monitored by SSA, or a combination thereof
(repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that while SSA developed an SOP for approving invoices and tracked the
costs for each agreement; the SOP was not as comprehensive as needed and, consequently, it did
not address the specific recommendation. Our review of two interagency agreements (entered
into since the last audit) disclosed SSA did not obtain payroll records, even though the
agreements were still structured to pay primarily based on the actual time spent and the salary
costs of the applicable university personnel. In addition, our review disclosed for these two
agreements, SSA paid $84,724 in January 2023 for 14 university employees who were not
included in the agreements.
