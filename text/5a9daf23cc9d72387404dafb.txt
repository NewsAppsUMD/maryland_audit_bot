Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is
responsible for the construction, operation and
maintenance of the Baltimore metropolitan area
transit system and for commuter services in the
suburban areas of the State. Transit modes in
operation include Metro subway, bus, light rail
and the MARC services.
(cid:190) MTA employed approximately 3,000 employees
and its FY 2007 operating and capital
expenditures totaled approximately $658
million, consisting of special funds totaling
$535 million and federal funds totaling $123
million.
(cid:190) The audit report, which covered the period from
August 1, 2004 to October 31, 2007, included
9 findings, 6 of which were repeated from the
preceding audit.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) MTA did not adequately control and account for
critical keys to bus fare revenue equipment or use
reports generated by its automated bus fare box
system to ensure that recorded collections were
deposited. From 3/07 to 6/07, system reports
showed recorded collections exceeding the related
amounts deposited by $475,000.
(cid:190) Preventive maintenance inspections of transit
buses were not timely performed in accordance
with Federal regulations, which could lead to
federal fiscal sanctions.
(cid:190) A grant payment totaling $433,000 was made in
violation of the related grant agreement.
(cid:190) Materials and supplies inventories, valued at $29
million, were not adequately controlled.
(cid:190) About 25% of MTA’s State-owned vehicles (cars,
vans, trucks and SUV’s) failed to meet the 10,000
minimum annual mileage requirement in FY 2007.

Inadequate Controls Over Bus Fare Box Revenues
(cid:190) Keys to bus fare revenue equipment were not
adequately controlled and accounted for. In
January 2008, MTA referred to the Office of the
Attorney General a matter regarding unusual usage
of keys used by an employee to improperly access
bus fare box collections. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) All 34 MTA employees responsible for fare
revenue processing activities had ready access
to critical keys.
(cid:131) A complete inventory listing of critical keys was
not maintained, including the names of
employees to whom keys were issued.
(cid:190) Reports from MTA’s automated fare box system,
which cost $21 million, were not used to verify that
recorded bus fare collections were deposited.
(cid:131) Collections on system reports from 3/07 to
6/07 exceeded deposits by $475,000.
(cid:131) Although MTA expressed doubts about the
reliability of the resultant reports, it had not
pursued this issue with the vendor.

Surveillance Activities Were Not Independent
(cid:190) Surveillance videos of passenger fare revenue
processing activities (for example, the physical
counting of collections and preparation of bank
deposits) at MTA’s central counting location were
not independently reviewed as the employees who
reviewed the videos also had access to the fare
revenue collections. (Finding 2)

Untimely Bus Preventive Maintenance Inspections
MTA did not meet federal requirements to perform
at least 80% of preventive bus maintenance
inspections in a timely manner. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) During the period from July 2006 through
December 2007, MTA did not perform 5,752
preventive maintenance bus inspections (or
66% of 8,714 inspections performed during the
period) within 10% of the required mileage
interval (3,000 miles).
(cid:131) The Federal Transportation Administration could
impose fiscal sanctions against MTA for failing
to perform timely preventive maintenance
inspections. During FY 2007, MTA received
approximately $30.3 million in federal funding
for its bus operations.
(cid:131) Untimely inspections may also violate bus
manufacturers’ warranties, potentially causing
MTA to unnecessarily incur maintenance and
repair costs normally covered by such
warranties.

Payment of Grant Funds After Expiration of Grant
MTA made a grant payment in violation of the
related agreement. (Finding 4)
(cid:131) In August 2006, MTA made a $433,000 grant
payment to a local college even though the
related agreement expired on June 30, 2003.
(cid:131) MTA advised that it made the payment without
having received documentation that the college
had actually incurred eligible and reimbursable
costs. Documentation subsequently received by
MTA indicated that the claimed costs had all
been incurred by the college after the grant
expired.
(cid:131) Although MTA ultimately paid the college more
than $1 million from the grant, the college had
not submitted to MTA various periodic progress,
financial and statistical reports required by the
grant agreement, nor had MTA performed an
audit of the college’s related records as of March
2008 to ensure propriety of the payments.

Inadequate M&S Controls / Low Vehicle Mileage
(cid:190) MTA had not established adequate controls over
materials and supplies inventories maintained at its
three primary and four satellite storeroom locations.
At FYE 2007, the book value of the inventory at the
primary storerooms totaled $29 million. (Finding 7)
(cid:131) $8 million in inventory maintained at the satellite
locations was not recorded on MTA’s automated
perpetual inventory records.
(cid:131) Critical duties were not adequately segregated at
certain storerooms and adjustments to inventory
records frequently were not supported.
(cid:190) Thirty-nine of 140 vehicles (cars, vans, trucks, and
SUV’s) subject to the State’s annual official mileage
requirement failed to achieve the minimum 10,000
miles a year during FY 2007. (Finding 9)
(cid:131) Average for the 39 vehicles was 6,137 official
miles - individual mileage ranged from 1,952 to
8,897.
(cid:131) Twenty-two of the 39 vehicles also failed to meet
the requirement during FY 2006.

Conclusion – MTA should…
(cid:190)ensure that physical access to all keys for fare
revenue equipment is restricted to authorized
personnel, and ensure the reliability of the automated
fare box system reports and use them to verify the
deposit of all recorded bus fare revenues.
(cid:190)ensure that surveillance videos of fare revenue
processing activities are reviewed by personnel who
do not have access to the related cash receipts.
(cid:190)complete preventive maintenance inspections of
buses in accordance with federal requirements and
MTA’s inspection plan.
(cid:190)verify that grantees comply with the terms of
applicable grant agreements. Also, for the grant
noted, MTA should obtain and review the necessary
documentation and recover any grant payments that
MTA determines to be unsupported.
(cid:190)Take corrective actions to improve internal controls
and accountability over its M&S inventories.
(cid:190)Monitor use and reassign/transfer any vehicle not
meeting the annual minimum mileage requirement.
