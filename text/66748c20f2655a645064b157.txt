Annapolis, Maryland
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland Correctional
Enterprises (MCE) for the period beginning April 1, 2019 and ending June 30,
2023. MCE, which is a unit within the Department of Public Safety and
Correctional Services (DPSCS), provides work and job training for
incarcerated individuals of the Maryland correctional system.
Our audit disclosed that MCE did not adequately pursue the collection of
delinquent accounts receivable. As of June 2023, $7 million of MCE’s $12.9
million in accounts receivable were outstanding over 90 days. Our testing
disclosed that MCE had not issued any dunning notices to three of five delinquent
accounts from State agencies which had been outstanding for periods ranging
from 261 days to 414 days.
We would also like to highlight that we were advised by the State’s Central
Collection Unit (CCU) that based on State regulations, MCE cannot refer State
agencies to CCU for collection action. This is notable because 96 percent ($6.7
million) of MCE’s accounts receivable outstanding over 90 days were from State
agencies and without the ability to send State agencies’ accounts receivable to
CCU, MCE was unable to effectively collect the amounts due.
Our audit also included a review to determine the status of the finding contained
in our preceding audit report. We determined that MCE satisfactorily addressed
this finding.
DPSCS’ response to this audit, on behalf of MCE, is included as an appendix
to this report. We reviewed the response to our finding and related

--- Page 4 ---
recommendations, and have concluded that the corrective actions identified
are sufficient to address all audit issues.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the audit by
MCE. We also wish to acknowledge DPSCS’ and MCE’s willingness to
address the audit issues and implement appropriate corrective actions.
Respectfully submitted,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland Correctional Enterprises (MCE) is organized under the State of
Maryland’s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS).
MCE operates under the provisions of the Correctional Services Article of the
Annotated Code of Maryland. The Correctional Services Article provides, in part,
that MCE develop programs that provide work experience or rehabilitation for
eligible incarcerated individuals. The Correctional Services Article also provides
that MCE be financially self-supporting. The goods produced (for example,
furniture, metal products, mattresses, and printing) and services offered (for
example, incarcerated individuals’ laundry) by MCE are available to State and
federal agencies, political subdivisions, and any charitable, civic, educational,
fraternal, or religious agency, association, or institution (for their own use and not
for resale to others), or as otherwise indicated in the law.
According to MCE’s audited financial statements, MCE’s fiscal year 2023
operating revenue and operating expenses were approximately $51.4 million and
$50 million, respectively, and its net operating income for fiscal year 2023 totaled
$1.4 million. As of June 30, 2023, MCE’s net position totaled $34.7 million.
Figure 1, on the following page, shows MCE’s expenditures for fiscal year 2023
according to the State’s accounting system.1 Figure 1 also shows MCE’s
authorized positions. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 18.1 percent of MCE’s
positions were vacant.
1 MCE management was unable to explain why the expenditure total recorded in the State’s
accounting system was 5.4 percent greater that the expenditure total recorded in the audited
financial statements. MCE management advised that this variance has been the case for years.

Financial Statement Audits
For fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 MCE engaged an independent
accounting firm to perform the audit of MCE’s financial statements. In the
related audit reports, the firm stated that MCE’s financial statements presented
fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of MCE and the
respective changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then
ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Number of Incarcerated Individuals Employed by MCE Has
Declined
MCE’s Fiscal Year 2020 and 2023 Annual Reports, submitted to the Governor,
disclosed that the number of incarcerated individuals employed in its enterprise
programs has decreased significantly since 2010 when there were 2,047
4

--- Page 7 ---
incarcerated individuals employed. As noted in Figure 2, incarcerated individual
employment dropped to a low of 821 in fiscal year 2020 but subsequently
increased to 1,115 incarcerated individuals employed in 2023.2 MCE’s 2024
Managing for Results Annual Performance Report noted its objective was to
employe 1,200 incarcerated individuals by 2027.
During the fiscal year 2023 legislative session, DPSCS, on behalf of MCE,
advised the General Assembly’s budget committees that it is working to increase
program participation. However, it has encountered numerous operational
interruptions with regard to the safety of participants as well as supply chain
issues, which impact program participation rates.

Status of Finding From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the finding contained in our
preceding audit report dated October 31, 2019. We determined that MCE
satisfactorily addressed this finding.
2 The average daily population of incarcerated individuals at DPSCS has declined by
approximately 4,500 since 2010. Further MCE’s employment of incarcerated individuals was
significantly reduced for health reasons during the COVID public health emergency in 2020 and
2021.

Findings and Recommendations
Accounts Receivable
Background
Maryland Correctional Enterprises (MCE) maintains accounts receivable records
for amounts due for goods and services provided by MCE to State agencies and
non-State entities, such as local governments. According to MCE’s records, as of
June 2023, the accounts receivable balance from its 26 business units in 10
correctional facilities and 1 administrative facility totaled approximately $12.9
million, of which $7 million (54 percent) was outstanding over 90 days. The vast
majority of both the total accounts receivable and accounts outstanding over 90
days related to amounts due from State agencies. See Figure 3 below. Accounts
are considered delinquent if they are not paid within 30 days of the invoice date.

Finding 1
MCE did not adequately pursue the collection of delinquent accounts
receivable.
Analysis
MCE did not adequately pursue the collection of delinquent accounts receivable.
Specifically, for accounts receivable due from State agencies, MCE did not
always send out dunning notices, as required by its procedures, and for non-State
customers MCE did not refer delinquent accounts to the State’s Central Collection
Unit (CCU).
 MCE did not take adequate action to pursue delinquent accounts due from
State agencies. Our test of five State agency accounts outstanding over 90
days as of June 30, 2023, totaling approximately $532,500,3 disclosed that
three accounts totaling $70,700 had been outstanding for periods ranging from
261 days to 414 days; however, MCE had not issued dunning notices as
required. For example, no dunning notices were sent to the Department of
Public Safety and Correctional Services’ Office of the Secretary for an invoice
totaling $44,500 dated July 25, 2022 (aged 414 days as of our test). For the
other two accounts tested, we noted that MCE had sent dunning notices and
one account was eventually paid after being outstanding for 443 days. The
other account was still delinquent (aged 564 days) as of our test date.
We were advised by CCU management that based on State regulations, MCE
cannot refer State agencies to CCU. CCU further advised that MCE needs to
work out repayment plans with other State agencies, including issuing
dunning notices and escalating the issues to senior leadership at the related
agency and to other Executive Branch oversight agencies, as needed. MCE
advised that as of December 2023, it had not discussed delinquent accounts
receivable with senior leadership at the related agencies nor with other
Executive Branch agencies such as the Governor’s Office. Moreover, MCE
continued to provide goods and services to the State agencies despite their
longstanding delinquent accounts.
 MCE did not refer delinquent accounts from non-State customers to CCU as
required. According to CCU’s records, MCE had not referred any delinquent
accounts since August 2018. CCU regulations, as amended for MCE,
generally require delinquent accounts to be referred to CCU 120 days after the
invoice date. MCE was unable to provide us with a report of accounts
3 Our test items were selected from 1 of the 26 business units which accounted for 75 percent of
the accounts receivable over 90 days.
7

--- Page 10 ---
receivable that were outstanding for 120 days but according to MCE’s
records, accounts receivable for non-State agencies that were outstanding for
90 days or more was approximately $286,000. Our review of five of the
accounts, totaling $7,915, included in MCE's records of accounts outstanding
for 90 days or more as of June 30, 2023 disclosed that these accounts had been
outstanding for periods ranging from 270 days to 774 days.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MCE
a. pursue collection of accounts receivable due from State agencies in
accordance with its policy and confer with senior leadership at the related
agency and other Executive Branch oversight agencies (such as the
Governor’s Office) for agencies that continue to have delinquent
accounts; and
b. refer delinquent accounts receivable balances of non-State agencies to
CCU in accordance with CCU regulations, as amended for MCE.
Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland Correctional
Enterprises (MCE), a unit within the Department of Public Safety and
Correctional Services (DPSCS), for the period beginning April 1, 2019 and
ending June 30, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine MCE’s financial
transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance with
applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included purchases and disbursements, cash receipts,
accounts receivable, materials and supplies, and equipment. We also determined
the status of the finding contained in our preceding audit report.
8

--- Page 11 ---
Our audit did not include certain support services provided to MCE by the
DPSCS – Central Operations. These support services (such as processing of
human resource transactions and procurement of certain information technology
related contracts) are included within the scope of our audit of the DPSCS –
Central Operations.
Our assessment of internal controls was based on agency procedures and controls
in place at the time of our fieldwork. Our tests of transactions and other auditing
procedures were generally focused on the transactions occurring during our audit
period of April 1, 2019 to June 30, 2023, but may include transactions before or
after this period as we considered necessary to achieve our audit objectives.
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, test of transactions,
and to the extent practicable, observations of MCE’s operations. Generally,
transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgement, which
primarily considers risk, the timing or dollar amount of the transaction, or the
significance of the transaction to the area of operation reviewed. As a matter of
course, we do not normally use sampling in our tests, so unless otherwise
specifically indicated, neither statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was
used to select the transactions tested. Therefore, unless sampling is specifically
indicated in a finding, the results from any tests conducted or disclosed by us
cannot be used to project those results to the entire population from which the test
items were selected.
We also performed various data extracts of pertinent information from the State’s
Financial Management Information System (such as revenue and expenditure
data). The extracts are performed as part of ongoing internal processes
established by the Office of Legislative Audits and were subject to various tests to
determine data reliability. We determined that the data extracted from this source
were sufficiently reliable for the purposes the data were used during this audit.
We also extracted data from MCE’s financial and manufacturing management
system for the purpose of selecting test items and assessing user access. We
performed various tests of the relevant data and determined that the data were
sufficiently reliable for the purposes the data were used during the audit. Finally,
we performed other auditing procedures that we considered necessary to achieve
our objectives. The reliability of data used in this report for background or
informational purposes was not assessed.
MCE’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records;
9

--- Page 12 ---
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including safeguarding of assets; and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved. As
provided in Government Auditing Standards, there are five components of
internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities,
information and communication, and monitoring. Each of the five components,
when significant to the audit objectives, and as applicable to MCE, were
considered by us during the course of this audit.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes a finding relating to a condition that we consider to be a
significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect MCE’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. This finding is also considered a significant instance of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Other less significant
findings were communicated to MCE that did not warrant inclusion in this report.
The response from DPSCS, on behalf of MCE, to our finding and
recommendations is included as an appendix to this report. As prescribed in the
State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we will advise DPSCS regarding the results of our review of its response.
