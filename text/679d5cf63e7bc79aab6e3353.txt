Members of Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee
Annapolis, Maryland
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a review of budget closeout transactions at the Maryland
Department of Health (MDH), the Department of Human Services (DHS), and the
Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2024. The Comptroller of Maryland - General Accounting Division (GAD)
provides instructions to State agencies for completing the fiscal year-end budget
closeout process which includes recording transactions (entries) in the State’s
accounting records.
Our review disclosed certain entries made by each of the three agencies were
either not in compliance, or otherwise represented significant conditions that
warrant disclosure in this report. This report also includes the results of our
review of certain accrued federal fund revenue entries recorded by the Maryland
Department of Emergency Management (MDEM) and the Maryland Department
of Labor (MDL) which were identified during the respective audits of these
agencies.
A summary of our findings and the related liabilities to the State, by agency, is
included in Exhibit 1. In total, we identified $3.7 billion in unsupported accruals,
$597 million in potential unfunded liabilities, and $166 million in known
unfunded liabilities. Many of these transactions relate to the recovery of federal
funds, some or all of which may ultimately be recovered by the departments.
However, to the extent that federal funds are not available or the related matters
are not resolved, State general funds may be needed to cover any related deficits.

--- Page 4 ---
In addition, subsequent to our review, the Department of Legislative Services
(DLS) notified the Spending Affordability Committee that MDH had a projected
$350 million budget deficit for fiscal year 2025 related to activity that was not
subject to this review.
The primary objective of this annual review is to alert the Maryland General
Assembly to significant financial and budgetary closeout entries that do not
comply with applicable laws, regulations, and policies or otherwise represent
significant matters relating to closeout that we noted and which we believe
warrant disclosure in this report. We advised the appropriate agencies of our
findings, but formal responses were not requested since this report contains no
recommendations.
Many of the issues identified in this report are the result of underlying systemic
deficiencies with the procedures and controls for accounting for the related
activity. These deficiencies have been and/or will be addressed in audits of the
respective agencies and will include recommendations.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the review by
each of the agencies.
Respectfully submitted,
Brian S. Tanen

Legislative Auditor

Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closeout entries that have not been previously recorded in the State’s
accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Annual Comprehensive
Financial Report.
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report, which, as of January 15, 2025, had not yet been
finalized for fiscal year 2024. The firm will determine whether the State’s
financial statements have been presented fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the State of Maryland as of June 30, 2024, and the
respective changes in the financial position and cash flows, for the year then
ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (referred to as GAAP).
Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Deficit Disclosed by the Maryland Department of
Health (MDH)
Subsequent to our review, the Department of Legislative Services (DLS) notified
the Spending Affordability Committee that MDH had a projected $350 million
budget deficit for fiscal year 2025. Based on information provided by MDH to
DLS, the deficit primarily relates to advanced payments to providers that had not
been recouped. In this regard, during fiscal year 2024 MDH recorded accounts
receivable entries totaling $342.3 million related to advanced payments to 202
providers that had not been recovered as of June 30, 2024.
Since these entries were not recorded as part of the fiscal year 2024 closing
process, they were not included in the scope of our current review. To the extent
these payments cannot be recovered, general funds will be needed to cover any
related deficits.

Introduction, Objective, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout entries for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2024. This review was conducted under the authority of the State
Government Article, Section 2-1220 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
Our review focused on entries processed by the Maryland Department of Health
(MDH), the Department of Human Services (DHS), and the Maryland State
Department of Education (MSDE). We chose these agencies based on our
professional judgment as to the overall significance and potential impact on the
State’s General Fund of those three departments’ year-end closing activity in
relation to the State as a whole. Specifically, these agencies collectively
accounted for $15.7 billion (80 percent) of the State’s $19.5 billion in federal fund
expenditures during fiscal year 2024.
The objective of our review was primarily to determine whether budget closeout
entries processed by MDH, DHS, and MSDE, for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2024, were properly supported and made in accordance with State budgetary
laws, regulations, and accounting policies. We also determined if other
significant liabilities or conditions relating to closeout existed at fiscal year-end.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end entries for MDH, DHS, and
MSDE, based on our assessment of risk and materiality, to ascertain if the entries
were properly supported and made in accordance with State budgetary laws,
regulations, and accounting policies and to determine if other significant liabilities
or conditions relating to closeout existed at fiscal year-end. We reviewed, on a
limited basis, entries processed subsequent to June 30, 2024 to determine if the
entries were properly recorded (such as charged or credited to the proper fiscal
year).
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
reported. Our fieldwork was conducted during the period from August 2024 to
December 2024.
This report includes the results of our review of these three agencies including
five findings repeated from our January 19, 2024 report entitled Statewide Review
of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2023 (see Exhibit 1). In
6

--- Page 9 ---
addition, this report includes the results of our review of certain accrued federal
fund revenue entries recorded by the Maryland Department of Labor and the
Maryland Department of Emergency Management which were identified during
recent audits of these agencies.
We advised each of the agencies of our findings. Formal responses were not
requested since this report contains no recommendations.

Findings
Accrued Revenue Entries
Background
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) requires all
federal fund accounts to be zeroed out at year-end. To accomplish this, agencies
must record an accrued revenue for any amounts due or defer any balances to the
next year (such as by recording a negative accrued revenue entry) as further
described in Figure 1.

Year-End Accrued
Explanation
Balance Revenue
 Expenditures exceed the revenue recorded in the account.
 A positive accrued revenue entry is recorded to close the
Deficit Positive
account at zero, with the expectation that the funds will be
received in the next fiscal year.
 Revenues exceed the expenditures recorded in the account.
 A negative accrued revenue entry is recorded to close the
Surplus Negative
account at zero, deferring the recognition of revenues, for funds
already received, to the next fiscal year.
GAD year-end closing instructions provide that these entries should reflect
amounts that are collectable within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year and that
revenue should be recognized in the same fiscal year the expenditure is made.
The closing instructions also require that detail documentation to support the
entries be maintained.
At the end of fiscal year 2024, Maryland Department of Health (MDH),
Department of Human Services (DHS), and Maryland State Department of
Education (MSDE) recorded accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $7.7

(recording a receivable for anticipated future funds due) and negative accrued
revenue entries totaling $3 billion (deferring revenue received to the subsequent
year (see Figure 2).

Finding 1
MDH could not provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued
federal fund revenue totaling approximately $1.7 billion or the subsequent
recovery of the funds.
Analysis
MDH was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of
approximately $1.7 billion in accrued federal fund revenue or the subsequent
recovery of the funds. At the end of fiscal year 2024, MDH recorded 994 accrued
federal fund revenue entries totaling $5.5 billion, including 560 positive accrued
revenue entries totaling $3 billion (recording a receivable for anticipated future
funds due) and 434 negative accrued revenue entries totaling $2.5 billion
(deferring revenue received to the subsequent year).
9

--- Page 12 ---
MDH Could Not Support Accrued Revenue Entries Tested
Our test of 10 positive accrued revenue entries totaling $2 billion1 disclosed that
MDH could not readily document that 8 of the positive entries totaling $1.7
billion accurately reflected amounts collectable from the federal government.
MDH used an automated script to record year-end revenue entries to offset
positive and negative account balances at year-end without verifying that the
amounts recorded were valid and collectable. An evaluation of these year-end
account balances at year-end is critical because of the significant amount of
federal funds MDH receives each year, which may mask unrecovered
expenditures.
Deficit balances would be expected at year-end (or on any given date) since MDH
program costs are generally recovered on a reimbursable basis. However, one
$900.8 million unsupported entry was recorded to a federal fund clearing account
in the Medical Care Program Administration (MCPA) to eliminate a deficit
balance in the account at year end. The deficit balance in the clearing account is
questionable since the account is only used to record and account for federal
revenues until allocation to the appropriate accounts and therefore, should not
have a negative balance. In this context, the entry recorded for this account
represents a shortfall in Medicaid reimbursements as of June 30, 2024.
Furthermore, we noted that a significant portion of MDH’s accrued revenue
entries were recorded to accounts that had no current year expenditures.
Specifically, our analysis of all 994 accrued revenue entries disclosed that 265
entries (27 percent) related to accounts that had no expenditure activity recorded
during fiscal year 2024, including 116 positive entries made to eliminate deficit
balances totaling $2 billion. In addition, 121 (46 percent) of the 265 entries were
identical to automated entries made in one or more prior fiscal years dating as far
back as June 30, 2015 (See Figure 3 on the following page). Accrued revenue
entries that are identical to entries made in previous fiscal years or for accounts
without related current year expenditures raise concerns that federal
reimbursement for previous State payments may not have been requested or may
no longer be available.

MDH’s behalf.
Source: State accounting records
MDH Could Not Document Recovery of Certain Accrued Revenues
MDH could not document that 8 of the aforementioned 10 accrued revenue
entries tested totaling $1.7 billion had been recovered from the federal
government. For example, 4 of the accrued revenue entries totaling $700 million
offset deficit balances at the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA).
However, as of November 2024, MDH could not document that any of the
amounts accrued had been recovered by DDA.
While some or all of these amounts may have been or will be recovered, to the
extent that the federal funds are not available, State general funds may be needed
to cover any related deficits. Similar conditions were noted during our two
preceding Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions reports for fiscal
years 2022 and 2023, and our most recent fiscal compliance audit report of the
MDH – Office of the Secretary and Other Units (dated October 19, 2023). At the
time of our review MDH management advised that it was still working to
implement corrective action in response to these prior findings.
11

--- Page 14 ---
Finding 2
DHS could not provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued
federal fund revenue totaling $877.2 million in positive entries and $500.4
million in negative entries or the subsequent recovery of the funds.
Analysis
DHS was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued
federal fund revenue entries. At the end of fiscal year 2024, DHS recorded 22
accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $1.4 billion consisting of 19 positive
accrued revenue entries totaling $877.2 million and 3 negative accrued revenue
entries totaling $500.4 million.
DHS Could Not Support Accrued Revenue Entries
Our test of all accrued revenue entries (both positive and negative) disclosed that
DHS could not readily document that these entries were accurate and/or reflected
amounts collectable from the federal government. DHS maintains a database
outside of the State’s accounting records to track expenditures and revenues
received for each of its federal grant programs. DHS recorded accrued revenue
entries in the State’s accounting records to bring each federal account balance to
zero, and advised us that these entries equaled the net amount receivable for all of
its federal grants according to this database.
Our review disclosed that, DHS did not analyze the accrued revenue entries to
ensure the amounts were related to fiscal year 2024 expenditures and to identify
variances indicative of errors in the underlying account balances. An evaluation
of the balances at year-end is critical because of the significant amount of federal
funds DHS receives each year, which may mask unrecovered expenditures or
errors in DHS’ accounting records.
In this regard, DHS did not identify certain questionable accrued revenue entries,
including a $306.9 million entry to eliminate the deficit balance in an account that
only had expenditures of $20 million during fiscal year 2024. Similar
questionable year-end entries in this account dating back to fiscal year 2020 were
previously commented upon in our Statewide Review of Budget Closeout
Transactions for Fiscal Year 2023. We noted that the accrued revenue entries for
the account increased from $10.9 million in fiscal year 2020 to $292.1 million in
fiscal year 2023, even though annual expenditures in the account never exceeded
$27 million.
12

--- Page 15 ---
DHS Could Not Document Recovery of the Recorded Accrued Revenue
DHS could not readily support that the year-end accrued revenues recorded for
fiscal year 2024 were received in the subsequent fiscal year. In this regard, as of
October 2024, DHS had not allocated funds received in fiscal year 2025 from the
accounts where the revenues were credited by the Office of the State Treasurer2 to
the accounts where the related accrued revenue entries were recorded. DHS also
could not readily document that the funds in these other accounts related to the
amounts accrued. DHS management advised that the lack of documentation was
due to the retirement of a key fiscal employee.
As a result of these conditions, we could not readily determine whether the funds
received in the subsequent year were related to the amounts accrued. While some
or all of these amounts may ultimately have been or will be recovered, to the
extent that the federal funds are not available, State general funds may be needed
to cover any related deficits.
Finding 3
MSDE could not provide documentation to support the propriety of accrued
federal fund revenue entries totaling $525.4 million or the subsequent
recovery of the funds.
Analysis
MSDE could not provide documentation to support the propriety of its accrued
federal fund revenue entries or the subsequent recovery of the funds. At the end
of fiscal year 2024, MSDE recorded 101 positive accrued federal fund revenue
entries totaling $878.8 million (there were no negative accrued revenue entries
recorded).
MSDE Could Not Support Accrued Revenue Entries Tested
Our test of 11 accrued revenue entries3 totaling $525.4 million disclosed that
MSDE could not readily document that these entries accurately reflected amounts
collectable from the federal government. Specifically, MSDE recorded accrued
revenue entries to bring each federal account balance to zero at year-end without
verifying that the amounts recorded were valid and collectable. MSDE did not
analyze the accrued revenue entries (some of which may have reflected combined
activity for multiple federal grants) to ensure the amounts were related to current

related State agency’s accounts to reflect the receipt of funds.
3 We selected these test items based on materiality.
13

--- Page 16 ---
expenditures and to identify any variances indicative of errors in the underlying
account balances.
Consequently, MSDE did not ensure that the accrued revenue entries were proper
and represented amounts that were actually collectable in the subsequent year.
This is significant because the net receivable balance represents approximately 55
percent of MSDE’s $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2024 expenditures (see Figure 2 on
page 9). Given that the federal government allows MSDE to recover federal
funds monthly, the amount recorded may be indicative of untimely recovery or
uncollectable federal funds.
In this regard, our review disclosed that certain amounts accrued appeared
questionable. For example, MSDE recorded a $61.4 million accrued revenue in a
clearing account that was intended to be used solely to record and account for
federal revenues and therefore, should not have a negative balance. In this
context, the entry recorded for this account represents a $61.4 million shortfall in
various grant reimbursements from the federal government as of June 30, 2024.
MSDE Could Not Document the Recovery of Recorded Accrued Revenue
Our aforementioned test disclosed that MSDE had not requested, or could not
document recovery of 9 accrued revenue entries totaling $278 million from the
federal government as of November 1, 2024.
 As of November 1, 2024, MSDE has not requested reimbursement for 5
accrued revenue journal entries totaling $145.3 million. MSDE advised that
between January and April 2024 it stopped requesting reimbursement for
federal grant expenditures because it needed to correct certain deficiencies
with its grant accounting records. MSDE could not provide an estimate of
when it would request reimbursement for these expenditures.
 Although MSDE advised that it received $110.7 million related to three
entries totaling $122 million, it could not support that the revenue received
related to the entries.
 MSDE had not received $2.5 million related to another entry totaling $10.7
million.
While some or all of these amounts may ultimately be recovered, to the extent
that the federal funds are not available, State general funds may be needed to
cover any related deficits. Similar conditions were noted during our Statewide
Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2023.

Accrued Revenue Findings Identified During Other OLA Audits
Background
During our routine fiscal compliance audits of the Maryland Department of
Emergency Management (MDEM) and Maryland Department of Labor (MDL)
we identified certain issues with their respective year-end accrued revenue entries.
We determined that the significance of the issues identified warranted inclusion in
this report. These findings will also be included with recommendations in the
forthcoming MDEM and MDL audit reports.
Finding 4
The Maryland Department of Emergency Management (MDEM) could not
support an accrued federal fund revenue entry totaling approximately $882.1
million or the subsequent recovery of certain of these funds.
Analysis
MDEM was unable to provide documentation to support the propriety of one
accrued federal fund revenue entry totaling approximately $882.1 million or the
subsequent recovery of the funds. At the end of fiscal year 2024, MDEM
recorded five accrued federal fund revenue entries totaling $903.6 million,
consisting of three positive accrued revenue entries totaling $891.3 million and
two negative accrued revenue entries totaling $12.3 million.
MDEM Could Not Support an Accrued Revenue Entry
Our test of one accrued revenue entry4 totaling $882.1 million disclosed that
MDEM recorded the entry to offset the negative balance in one account without
verifying that the amount recorded was valid and collectable from the federal
government. The amount accrued seemed questionable because MDEM
management advised us that it pursued federal reimbursement quarterly, and the
amount accrued at year-end exceeded total fiscal year 2024 expenditures of
$698.8 million.
MDEM Could Not Document Recovery of Recorded Accrued Revenue
MDEM also could not readily document that it had requested and collected
certain of the amounts accrued. As of December 6, 2024, MDEM had only
recovered $520.9 million of the $882.1 million (59 percent). As of January 15,
2025, MDEM was still in the process of investigating the remaining $361.2
million. While some or all of the remaining funds may ultimately be recovered,
to the extent that the federal funds are not available, State general funds may be
needed to cover any related deficits.
4 We selected this test item based on materiality.
15

--- Page 18 ---
Finding 5
The Maryland Department of Labor (MDL) could not support accrued
federal fund revenue entries totaling $204.7 million, including a $67.6 million
entry which MDL was aware was not recoverable because it had exceeded
the related federal grant. In addition, MDL could not document the
subsequent recovery of the accrued funds.
Analysis
MDL could not provide documentation to support the propriety of its accrued
federal fund revenue entries or the subsequent recovery of funds, including at
least $67.6 million that MDL had determined was not collectable from the federal
government. At the end of fiscal year 2024, MDL recorded 21 accrued federal
revenue entries totaling $210.2 million, consisting of 18 positive accrued revenues
totaling $204.7 million and 3 negative accrued revenue entries totaling $5.5
million.
MDL Could Not Support Accrued Revenue Entries
Our review disclosed that MDL recorded 18 positive accrued revenue entries
totaling $204.7 without ensuring the amounts were related to current expenditures
and collectable. Specifically, MDL recorded accrued revenues based on the
balances for each budgetary appropriation number, which generally reflected
combined activity for multiple federal grants. This process did not ensure that the
accrued revenue entries were proper and represented amounts that were actually
collectable in the subsequent year. An evaluation of year-end account balances is
critical because of the significant amount of federal funds MDL receives each
year, which may mask unrecovered expenditures or errors in MDL’s accounting
records.
MDL Could Not Support That it Received the Accrued Revenue
MDL could not readily support that accrued revenues were subsequently received.
We selected three accrued revenues5 totaling $114.3 million accrued to see
whether the revenue was subsequently recovered. MDL advised us that it had
recovered some of two of the accruals, but could not specify how much was
recovered or support that the funds received were related to these accruals. For
the third accrual, MDL recorded a $71.7 million entry to eliminate a deficit
balance in one account even though MDL was aware that $67.6 million of the
amount accrued was not recoverable from the federal government because it had
exceeded the available federal funding.
5 We selected these test items based on materiality.
16

--- Page 19 ---
Our review disclosed that the $67.6 million was an accumulation of deficits
dating back to fiscal year 2020. MDL management advised that it was in
consultation with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to address
the deficit. To the extent that federal funds are not available for this and the other
accrued revenue entries , State general funds may be needed to cover these
deficits.
Expenditure Entries
Finding 6
Year-end expenditure entries recorded by DHS were not always supported,
certain of which resulted in the improper reversion of $64.3 million in
general funds.
Analysis
DHS could not support certain year-end expenditure entries, resulting in the
improper reversion of $64.3 million in general funds. DHS initially records most
of its expenditures in holding accounts and then uses expenditure information
tracked in a separate database to periodically transfer the expenditures from the
holding accounts to the appropriate budgetary unit, fiscal year, and fund type.
DHS recorded 144 expenditure entries with an effective date of June 30, 2024
which transferred expenditures totaling $3.9 billion, including increases of
expenditures of $2.8 billion and decreases of $1.1 billion.
Our test of 10 of these expenditure entries6 totaling $2 billion disclosed that DHS
could not support the propriety of 8 entries totaling $484.4 million. Specifically,
DHS could not provide documentation to support the basis for the entries. This is
significant because in September 2024, DHS notified GAD that it had incorrectly
recorded general fund expenditures in one account. As a result, the year-end
balance in this account improperly reflected a surplus balance of $64.3 million
even though DHS had expended the entire appropriation.
Due to the incorrect balance, DHS reverted the $64.3 million at fiscal year-end
and therefore the funds are no longer available to cover the incurred fiscal year
2024 expenditures. Consequently, the $64.3 million may have to be funded with
subsequent year appropriations or through a deficiency appropriation. DHS
management advised that it was working with DBM and the Governor’s Office to
determine the necessary corrective actions.
6 Test items were selected based on materiality.

Other Liabilities
Finding 7
MDH reported $273.6 million in unprovided for general fund payables and
other general fund liabilities as of June 30, 2024.
Analysis
MDH reported unprovided for general fund payables and other potential general
fund liabilities totaling approximately $273.6 million as of June 30, 2024.
Disallowed DDA Claims
In June 2018, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
notified MDH that it was disallowing claims made between July 1, 2010 and June
30, 2013, totaling $34.2 million, related to add-on services for certain consumers
that DDA approved without considering the consumers’ level of need. The
Maryland Office of Attorney General, on behalf of MDH and DDA, appealed
CMS’ decision but the appeal was denied in October 2024. In addition to the
aforementioned $34.2 million in disallowed claims, CMS will assess interest
accrued since the initial disallowance in June 2018. Consequently, the total
federal liability will likely exceed $34.2 million. Comments regarding this
federal liability have been made in our nine preceding Statewide Review of Budget
Closeout Transactions reports dating back to our review of fiscal year 2015.
Unprovided For Medicaid Payments
MDH reported a $213.7 million unprovided for general fund payable related to
estimated reimbursements to Medicaid providers for services rendered during
fiscal year 2024 that had still not been billed to Medical Care Programs
Administration (MCPA) as of June 30, 2024. Since this amount exceeded MDH’s
2024 appropriation, to the extent these expenditures are realized during fiscal year
2025, this amount may have to be funded with subsequent year appropriations (or
through a deficiency appropriation). This amount reflects a significant increase in
the unfunded liability from the $32.8 million commented upon in our Statewide
Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal Year 2023.
Potential Liability for Unspent MFP Funds
MDH reported a potential federal liability of approximately $25.7 million for an
obligation related to enhanced funding received under the MCPA Money Follows
the Person (MFP) program. The State obtained federal funds covering 75 percent
of its MFP program expenditures instead of the more traditional 50 percent
federal funding arrangement used in many other federal assistance programs. The
additional 25 percent in enhanced federal reimbursements is required to be spent
on additional MFP program expenditures.
18

--- Page 21 ---
As noted in our Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal
Years 2021, 2022, and 2023 reports, MDH has continuously failed to spend the
enhanced funding received on qualified MFP program expenditures resulting in a
growing potential liability. Specifically, the potential liability reported by MDH
for fiscal years ending 2021, 2022, and 2023 totaled $22.3 million, $24.4 million,
and $24.9 million, respectively.7 This amount grew to $25.7 million as of June
30, 2024. MDH has until September 30, 2025 to spend these savings on MFP
program expenditures or they will need to be returned to the federal government.
Consequently, this amount may have to be funded with subsequent year
appropriations (or through a deficiency appropriation).
Finding 8
DHS did not report potential unprovided for general fund payables totaling
$26 million to GAD.
Analysis
DHS identified potential unprovided for general fund payables totaling $26
million subsequent to the fiscal year 2024 closing process that have not been
disclosed to GAD. Specifically, DHS identified fiscal year 2024 expenditures in
two accounts related to Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA) and foster care
maintenance payments coordinated by DHS’ Social Services Administration
which exceeded its general fund appropriations by $18.6 million and $7.4
million,8 respectively.
DHS management advised that it was working with DBM and the Governor’s
Office to determine the necessary corrective actions, but that it was still in the
process of reconciling the expenditures for these accounts. To the extent that
expenditures exceeded the fiscal year 2024 appropriation for this account, these
expenditures may have to be funded with subsequent year appropriations or
through a deficiency appropriation.
7 MDH advised that the amounts reported in previous fiscal years incorrectly reflected the total
MFP savings rather than the portion that MDH is required to spend before September 30, 2025.
MDH corrected this error when reporting the unobligated balance for fiscal year 2024.
Therefore, the potential liability for fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023 presented above does not
agree to the amounts presented in our preceding closeout reports of $49.3 million, $52 million,
and $56 million, respectively.
8 This amount is in addition to the $64.3 million deficit identified in Finding 6.

Finding 9
DHS had a $100.2 million deficit balance in a non-budgeted clearing account
that may require general funds to resolve.
Analysis
DHS had a $100.2 million deficit balance in a non-budgeted9 fund account that
may require general funds to resolve. The account is a clearing account used by
DHS to initially record general and federal fund expenditures related to various
assistance payments, such as TCA. These expenditures must be transferred to the
correct budgetary unit and be allocated between federal and general funds to
finance these expenditures.
DHS management was not aware of this negative account balance until we
brought it to its attention in December 2024. DHS advised it would need to
research this fund balance and determine the appropriate corrective action to
resolve the deficit. To the extent that general and federal funds are not available,
these expenditures may have to be funded with subsequent year general fund
appropriations (or through a deficiency appropriation).
Special Funds
Finding 10
MSDE had year-end deficit balances in certain special funds that may
require general funds to resolve.
Analysis
MSDE had year-end deficit balances in certain special funds that may require
general funds to resolve. MSDE accounted for each of its special funds in one or
more accounts and at year-end reported net balances totaling approximately $3.24
billion to GAD. We reviewed six of these special fund balances with a net
balance of $3.20 billion (see Figure 4 on the following page).
9 Non-budgeted accounts are cash accounts without an appropriation.

We noted that four funds had net negative balances totaling $26.7 million that
could not be readily explained. Similar unexplained deficit balances in these
accounts were noted in our Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for
Fiscal Year 2023. MSDE advised that it was in the process of investigating and
resolving these balances. To the extent that special funds are not available to
cover these deficits, State general funds may be needed.

Finding 11
DHS had year-end deficit balances in certain special funds that may require
general funds to resolve.
Analysis
DHS had year-end deficit balances in certain special funds that may require
general funds to resolve. As shown in Figure 5, DHS accounted for each of its 6
special funds using one or more accounts and at fiscal 2024 year-end had net
balances totaling approximately $9.8 million.

DHS advised that the net deficit account balances (totaling $204.2 million) were
offset by the net positive balances in the other accounts (totaling $214 million).
However, as of December 2024, DHS had not investigated these balances to
determine the extent to which they were related nor processed any journal entries
to eliminate the deficits. To the extent that special funds are not available to cover
these deficits, State general funds may be needed.
