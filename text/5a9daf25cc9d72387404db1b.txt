Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF)
operates under the provisions of Title 20 of the
Insurance Article.
(cid:190) MAIF consists of two Divisions:
(cid:131) The Insured Division provides automobile
liability and property damage insurance
coverage primarily on personal vehicles to
Maryland residents who are unable to obtain
coverage from private insurance carriers.
(cid:131) The Uninsured Division is responsible for
paying claims to eligible victims of traffic
accidents caused by operators of uninsured
or unidentified vehicles.
(cid:190) CY 2008 paid claims totaled $108 million.
Operating expenditures totaled $50.6 million.
(cid:190) The audit report contained 5 findings.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) During CY 2008, MAIF’s Board of Trustees
approved changes to the employee bonus
program for that year that allowed for the payment
of employee bonuses totaling $1.4 million, the
majority of which would not have been paid
without those changes.
(cid:190) MAIF incurred certain expenditures that may not
be consistent with MAIF’s primary mission as a
State-created insurer of last resort.
(cid:190) MAIF did not follow its established procurement
procedures for certain transactions, nor always
maintain sufficient documentation for credit card
expenditures.

Employee Bonuses – Policy Issue
(cid:190) During CY 2008, MAIF’s Board of Trustees
approved changes to certain critical requirements
of MAIF’s employee bonus program for that year.
(Finding 1)
(cid:190) Although within its authority, we question the
timing and appropriateness of those changes.
The changes occurred during the applicable year
after it became apparent the original
requirements would not be met. Also, MAIF
incurred a net loss for the year.
(cid:190) Changes allowed for the payment of bonuses
totaling $1.4 million, instead of $250,000 that
would have been paid under the original
requirements.

Employee Bonuses (continued)
(cid:131) MAIF’s bonus program, as initially established for
CY 2008, required that certain financial and non-
financial goals be met as a condition for paying
bonuses to employees.
(cid:131) In June 2008, the Board revised the financial
goal, thereby allowing bonuses to be awarded for
lower financial results than initially required,
such as lower premium income, higher losses or
expenses, or combinations thereof . (See Exhibit
A – Combined Ratio Goal). This change
accounted for 75 percent of the $1 million in
bonus payments made to non-management
employees.

Employee Bonuses (continued)
(cid:131) In December 2008, the Board essentially waived
another requirement that MAIF must have a net
income gain* before paying bonuses to
management /executive employees.
• MAIF ended CY 2008 with a net loss of
approximately $19.6 million. (See Exhibit B –
Calculation of CY 2008 Net Loss)
• All management and executive employees
(approximately 30) received bonuses totaling
$407,000. This amount was reduced from what
would have been paid if MAIF had incurred a net
income gain.
* Based on the results of both insurance and investment
activities.

Employee Bonuses (continued)
(cid:190) MAIF advised that these program changes were
necessary and justified, in part, because current
economic trends were competing and
undercutting the appropriateness of the goals.
(cid:190) MAIF also noted that the CY 2008 net loss was
not the result of underperformance on the part
of management employees, but the result of
“deliberate decision making on the part of
management in response to radically altered
corporate imperatives” as well as the effects of
the worldwide financial crisis.

Disclosure of Certain Expenditures - Policy Issue
(cid:190) Disclosure of certain expenditures should be made
as part of the annual budget submission to
legislative committees. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) MAIF incurred certain expenditures that appeared
inconsistent with the primary mission of a State-
created entity designated as an insurer of last
resort.
(cid:131) During CY 2008 and 2009 (through May 31),
MAIF expended approximately:
• $96,000 for strategic consulting services
• $81,000 for marketing, public relations, &
advertising
• $74,000 for lobbying services
• Expenditures were also incurred for producer
appreciation events, such as $15,000 for
catering and space rental, and $9,000 for
corporate sponsorships.

Disclosure of Certain Expenditures (continued)
(cid:190) MAIF receives no general funds, and currently
submits its budget to the General Assembly for
informational purposes only. The budget
submission does not include the type of detailed
expenditure data noted here.
(cid:190) State law does not prohibit these expenditures
and MAIF considers such expenditures necessary
to help it successfully fulfill its mission. While
created as an insurer of last resort, State law
does allow MAIF to provide coverage to
preexisting customers, which effectively places a
segment of MAIF’s business in competition with
private insurers.

Procurements and Disbursements
Procurement transactions processed by MAIF were
not always consistent with procedures established
in its Procurement Procedures Manual. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) Written documentation justifying the use of the
sole source procurement method was not on
file as required for 3 service agreements
procured in this manner. Expenditures for
these 3 contracts, which were for certain
consulting and marketing services, totaled
approximately $287,000 between January
2007 and May 2009.
(cid:131) A written contract was not on file for certain
maintenance services which MAIF had been
receiving for approximately 11 years.
Payments to this vendor during CY 2008
totaled approximately $20,000.

Other Payment Issues
(cid:131) Sufficient documentation was not always obtained
to support credit card expenditures. For example,
detailed supporting receipts were not on file for 51
of 61 credit card expenditures examined totaling
$14,100. These expenditures included, for
example, restaurant billings totaling approximately
$4,000. (Finding 4)
(cid:131) Certain payments to plaintiff attorneys were not
reported in accordance with IRS regulations due to
incomplete vendor coding information in MAIF’s
records. Our test of five such payments, totaling
$100,000, made by the Uninsured Division during
CY 2008 disclosed that the required IRS Form
1099 had not been issued for any of the payments.
Attorney payments by the Division totaled $1.3
million during CY 2008. (Finding 5)

Conclusion
(cid:190) MAIF’s Board of Trustees should not significantly
revise or waive critical requirements of MAIF’s
employee bonus program to allow for the payment
of bonuses after the requirements have been
approved and the applicable year has begun.
(cid:190) MAIF should report to the legislative budget
committees detailed budget and expenditure data
for consulting and lobbying services, marketing
and public relations costs, as well as expenditures
for producer related events, corporate
sponsorships, and similar outreach initiatives.
(cid:190) MAIF should ensure that all procurement
transactions are consistent with its Procurement
Procedures Manual.
(cid:190) MAIF should ensure that appropriate support is
obtained for all expenditures, that its records of
attorney payments are complete, and that IRS
reporting requirements are met.

Exhibit A - Combined Ratio Goal
The combined ratio goal equals the total underwriting
expenses (losses + loss adjustment expenses + other
underwriting expenses) divided by premiums earned. To
be eligible for bonuses, the achieved percentage must be
at or below the established goal percentage.
(cid:131) Combined ratio goal approved in 12/07 for CY 2008 bonus
program was:
111.6% = projected expenses $149.5 million
projected premiums $134 million
(cid:131) Goal was changed from 111.6 % to 120% in 6/08.
(cid:131) Achieved combined ratio for CY 2008 was:
118.8% = actual expenses $144.4 million
actual premiums $121.5 million
