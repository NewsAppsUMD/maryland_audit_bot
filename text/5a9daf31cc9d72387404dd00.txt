provided with information about the State’s
“whistleblower” laws, if reassurance is needed.
 Audit professionals (certified fraud examiners)
handle calls during business hours in
accordance with established procedures.

due diligence is performed before field

Department of Juvenile Services (DJS)
(November 1, 2017)
In conjunction with our regular audit of DJS, we
pursued and confirmed allegations of questionable
procurement practices (Finding 3).
• DJS artificially divided procurements for certain
goods and services circumventing State
procurement regulations. For example, during FYs
2014 - 2016, one vendor received 204 payments
totaling $1.5 million, of which 202 were for
$15,000 or less, with several for similar services
over a three-day period.
• We identified questionable activities, including 18
procurements of routine services totaling
$219,000 that were not publicly solicited, and
were awarded to two companies owned by the
same individuals (the only bidders).
• Certain DJS employees were able to directly solicit,
receive, and evaluate bids and select the vendors
without extensive involvement of DJS central
procurement personnel.

Baltimore City Community College (BCCC)
(November 14, 2017)
In conjunction with our regular audit of BCCC, we
pursued and confirmed allegations of questionable
procurement practices in BCCC’s Facilities Planning
and Operations Department. Other matters were also
identified (Findings 1 and 2).
• The Department artificially divided procurements
for certain goods and services circumventing State
procurement regulations. During FYs 2014 - 2016,
178 payments were made to 7 vendors for goods
and services totaling approximately $420,000,
each of which was less than $15,000
• Department employees directly solicited, received,
and evaluated the bids and selected the vendors.
BCCC central procurement personnel were only
required to execute the purchase orders.
• Our review of 16 Department procurements totaling
$140,000, each under $15,000, disclosed that for
6 procurements totaling $65,000, there were
relationships between competing bidders, including
ownership by the same individual or close relatives.

• We also found questionable charges totaling
$42,000, such as billings for work on BCCC rooms
or equipment that did not exist, and a lack of detail
from vendor proposals and billings necessary to
determine the propriety of charges totaling
$28,000.
• Several Department employees shared their
corporate purchasing cards (CPC) at the direction
of a former management employee. The
Department’s CPC activity from FYs 2014 - 2016
totaled $1.1 million.
o Our review of five CPC payments for
maintenance services totaling $10,900
disclosed three purchases totaling $6,500 that
were not supported.
• BCCC’s compliance hotline received several
allegations regarding certain Department activities,
but BCCC did not adequately pursue the
allegations, such as conduct a detailed review of
transactions.
