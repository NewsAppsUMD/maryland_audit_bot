Introduction and Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires each county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in
Maryland to file annual (or once every four years under specified conditions)
audit reports. There were 192 local government audit reports due for our fiscal
year 2017 review (24 counties, 153 cities and towns, and 15 taxing areas which
are created under State law). The reports are to include financial statements, with
accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions as to whether the
financial statements are fairly presented. The financial statements are required to
be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. We have
prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide additional information
regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing requirements.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-307 of the Code requires the Office of
Legislative Audits to perform a desk review of each local government’s annual
audit report for compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and
auditing standards. As part of the desk review process, we also addressed other
attributes as described below. Section 16-308 of the Article specifies the
reporting and review requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by
the counties. The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special
taxing district’s compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for
submitting the districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is
required to review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2017 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing areas, as
well as one fiscal year 2014 report (Town of Deer Park); three fiscal year 2015
reports (City of Hyattsville, Bel Air Special Taxing Area, and Mount Savage
Special Taxing Area); and three fiscal year 2016 reports (City of Glenarden, City
of Mount Rainier, and Bel Air Special Taxing Area) that were received over the
last year. The desk reviews consisted of reading each audit report in order to
accomplish the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and certain
accounting and auditing standards pertaining to the presentation of the
financial statements and auditors’ reports.
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits, timely filing of audit reports).
5

--- Page 8 ---
 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances or unfavorable trends and ratios, based on analyses of financial
data over the most recent five-year period (July 1, 2012 through June 30,
2017).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2017 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.
At the conclusion of our review, letters were sent to applicable local governments
and their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies disclosed during
the review so that corrective actions can be taken to help ensure future
compliance. Additionally, as appropriate, letters were also sent to local
governments, and to their legislative representatives, to communicate
noncompliance with State law or potential financial problems. For these issues,
the local governments were asked to advise us of corrective actions that will be
taken.

Audit Reports
Finding 1
A number of local governments had not filed the required audit reports or
had filed after the required filing date.
As of July 26, 2018, eight local governments were delinquent in filing audit
reports as required by the Local Government Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland.
Local Government Fiscal Years Outstanding
Town of Deer Park 2015, 2016, 2017
City of Hyattsville 2016, 2017
Town of Lonaconing 2017
Town of Marydel 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017
City of Mount Rainier 2017
City of Seat Pleasant 2017
Bel Air Special Taxing Area 2017
Washington Suburban Transit Commission 2017
Furthermore, 17 local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date. The submission of audit reports after the required filing date was also
noted for 8 of these 17 local governments during at least our preceding year’s
review. The failure of a local government to file an audit report, or a delay in
filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The Local
Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
generally requires audit reports to be filed on or before October 31 after the close
of the fiscal year or on or before December 31 after the close of the fiscal year for
those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Budget language adopted during the 2018 Session of the Maryland General
Assembly (Chapter 570, 2018 Laws of Maryland) has resulted in the withholding
of certain transportation aid from two local governments (Towns of Deer Park and
Marydel) pending receipt of their delinquent audit reports. Furthermore, failure to
file a required report with the Department of Legislative Services for three
successive years provides the Executive Director with reasonable cause to
suppose that the municipality is no longer actively operating under its charter,
which could cause these towns to have their charter repealed. The failure of these
two local governments to submit audit reports has been reported to the Executive
7

--- Page 10 ---
Director. The failure of the City of Hyattsville to file the required reports for the
fiscal years ending June 30, 2016 and 2017 has also been reported to the
Executive Director.
Subsequent to July 26, 2018, the Town of Marydel submitted its audit reports for
the fiscal years ending June 30, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, although its fiscal
year 2017 report is still outstanding. Regarding the financial statements
submitted, the auditor was not able to express an opinion (that is, the auditor
issued a disclaimer of opinion for all four years) because the auditor had not been
able to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to provide a basis for an audit
opinion. Specifically, the auditor noted that a significant portion of the Town’s
financial records were missing or incomplete. An audit report containing a
disclaimer of opinion does not satisfy the audit requirements of the Local
Government Article as stated in the audit guidelines issued annually by our
Office.
We will review all delinquent audit reports and take any follow-up action
necessary when the reports are received. The results of these reviews will be
included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2018 local government audit
reports.
The towns of Barclay, Barton, Brookview, Church Creek, Eagle Harbor,
Eldorado, Galestown, Goldsboro, Henderson, Highland Beach, Hillsboro,
Mardela Springs, Port Tobacco, Queen Anne, and the Ellerslie and Mount Savage
Special Taxing Areas had previously requested and were granted waivers from
filing audit reports. These local governments met the conditions for filing an
audit report every fourth year as provided for under the Local Government
Article, Section 16-305 of the Code and, depending on the waiver period, will be
required to file its next audit report for either fiscal year 2018, 2019, or 2020.
Finding 2
The auditor’s report for one local government contained an adverse opinion
on one opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit.
The auditor’s report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion (a
statement that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles) on the discretely presented component
unit opinion unit because of the omission of financial data for the Town’s
component unit. Specifically, financial data related to a development corporation
that is a component unit of the Town had not been audited and was not included
in the Town’s financial statement.
8

--- Page 11 ---
The Town’s audit report also contained a qualified opinion (a statement that,
except for the effects of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial
statements are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles) on the governmental activities opinion unit because the Town had not
measured the effect of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
49 entitled “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation
Obligations.” According to the report, certain buildings of the development
corporation contained asbestos and, although deemed improbable, the Town could
become liable for the cost of abatement.
As a result, the Town’s financial statements were not presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required by State law. The
Town’s audit reports for each fiscal year since 2009 also contained an adverse
opinion and a qualified opinion due to these situations.
The auditor for the Town of Sykesville submitted a letter providing explanations
regarding the opinions that were not unqualified as required, but the resolution of
the applicable conditions is uncertain.
Finding 3
Auditors’ reports for five local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for five local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards. The following is a
summary of these deficiencies:
Number of
Area of Noncompliance
Audit Reports
Auditor did not express an opinion on all opinion units or 3
financial statements.
Auditor’s report did not include all basic elements (for 2
example, auditor did not include an emphasis-of-
matter paragraph related to adjustments to correct a
material misstatement).
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires that audits be performed in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. These standards require, in part, that the auditor express an
opinion(s) as to whether the basic financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the respective financial position, the respective changes in
9

--- Page 12 ---
financial position, and cash flows, where applicable, of the local government in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Financial Statements
Finding 4
Financial statements submitted by 27 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 27 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of three of these local governments included two such deficiencies.
Furthermore, the financial statements of 2 of these 27 local governments included
a deficiency that was also cited during our preceding year’s review. The
following is a summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of
instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
All required financial statements were not presented or 13
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 10
presentation of net position was improper).
Items reported as assets, deferred outflows of resources, 5
liabilities, or deferred inflows of resources were not
properly displayed.
Governmental fund balances were not properly 2
classified.
Finding 5
Financial statements, accompanying notes, and required supplementary
information did not include certain disclosures required by generally
accepted accounting principles for three local governments.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or
disclosed in the accompanying notes or the required supplementary information,
for three audit reports. Specifically, the local governments did not include certain
disclosures regarding long-term debt, cash deposits, or pensions. Adequate
10

--- Page 13 ---
disclosure is necessary to facilitate the understanding of, and to provide for fair
presentation of, the financial information.
Noncompliance with State Law
Finding 6
Financial statements of 12 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required
by State law.
Financial statements of 12 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law (Exhibit A). The Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland requires that deposits with financial institutions by
local governmental units be fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes
the risk of loss of deposits in the event the financial institution defaults. In
addition, this law requires that collateral be of the types specified in the State
Finance and Procurement Article, Section 6-202 of the Code.
Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.
Finding 7
An unrestricted general fund deficit balance was noted for one local
government as of June 30, 2017.
An unrestricted general fund deficit balance was noted for one local government
as of June 30, 2017 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of
the current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem.
11

--- Page 14 ---
Finding 8
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for one local
government as of June 30, 2017.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for one local government as
of June 30, 2017 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local government had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Article,
Section 16-306 of the Code. Section 16-308 of this Article requires that certain
types of special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the
county in which the districts are located not later than 90 days after the close of
the fiscal year, in accordance with the rules and regulations established by the
applicable county. The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each
district’s compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting
copies of these reports to the Office of Legislative Audits.
Finding 9
The required report had not been filed for one special taxing district as of
July 26, 2018.
As of July 26, 2018, we had not received the required report for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2017 for one special taxing district, which is located in Anne
Arundel County. Anne Arundel County advised us that they were in the process
of pursuing compliance with applicable filing requirement for this district and that
appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding funds).
