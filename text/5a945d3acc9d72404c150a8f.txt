Ladies and Gentlemen:
We conducted a performance audit to determine the accuracy of selected
Managing for Results (MFR) performance measure data reported in the Maryland
fiscal year 2011 operating budget request. We also determined whether adequate
control systems were in place for collecting, summarizing, and reporting the
performance measure data.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, we are
systematically auditing the results of the 62 MFR measures contained in the 2005
Managing for Results - State Comprehensive Plan, which was produced by the
Department of Budget and Management. This audit is the fourth to be conducted
on the 62 measures and focuses on the data reported for the 13 measures
contained within the Health portion of the State Comprehensive Plan. The
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) was responsible for
reporting these results for 12 measures and the Maryland State Department of
Education (MSDE) was responsible for reporting the results for the remaining
measure. A list of the 62 MFR measures is contained in Exhibit 3 of this report.
As a result of our audit, we have classified each of the 13 measures as either
Certified, Certified with Qualification, Inaccurate, or Factors Prevented
Certification as noted in the chart on the next page. These designations are
further described in Exhibit 2. Three of the 13 measures included multiple sub-
measure results that were separately evaluated before a conclusion was drawn
regarding the certification level for the measure as a whole. If sub-measures
within a given measure had differing certification results, we concluded on

--- Page 4 ---
the overall certification level for the measure by considering the various sub-
measure certification levels and the significance of any variances. The audit
results for the 13 measures are as follows:
Level of Certification
Factors Performance

4 4 - 5 13
The primary factor contributing to our inability to certify five measures was that
DHMH was not adequately ensuring that supporting data used to calculate the
measures were complete and accurate. In addition, for two of the measures that
we could not certify, the contractors responsible for calculating the measures were
not independent since they also provided services related to their respective
measures.
An executive summary of our findings can be found on page 4, and our audit
scope, objectives, and methodology are explained on page 15. The responses
from DHMH and MSDE to this audit are included as appendices to this report.
We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us by DHMH and MSDE
during the audit.
Respectfully submitted,

Executive Summary
Background Information
In July 1997, the Governor implemented the Managing for Results (MFR)
initiative, which is a strategic planning process used by department leaders and
others to establish direction and priorities for State programs to achieve
meaningful results. MFR requires State agencies to submit missions, goals,
objectives, and performance measures for each program as part of the annual
budget request. This information may then be considered in determining
Statewide spending priorities and the allocation of resources in agency budgets.
Effective July 1, 2004, the MFR process was established in State law, with the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM) as the lead agency for developing
a State comprehensive plan for MFR. The resultant 2005 Managing for Results -
State Comprehensive Plan categorized MFR goals into five functional areas,
referred to as pillars, which contained a total of 62 measures.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, we are
systematically auditing these 62 measures. This audit is the fourth to be
conducted pursuant to this request and focuses on the certain data reported by the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) and the Maryland State
Department of Education (MSDE) in the Maryland fiscal year 2011 operating
budget request. The categories of performance certification are explained in
Exhibit 2 of this report, and a list of the 62 MFR measures is contained in Exhibit
3. Exhibit 4 references the first three MFR audit reports issued by our Office,
which collectively covered 21 measures in the Public Safety and Safer
Neighborhoods, Education, and Fiscal Responsibility portions of the State
Comprehensive Plan.
Conclusions
We concluded that, for the 13 measures tested, 4 were Certified, 4 were Certified
with Qualification, and 5 were designated as Factors Prevented Certification.
These results are further described in the Findings section of this report.

Recommendations
The following detailed recommendations are among those we made to DHMH
and MSDE to help strengthen the quality control processes and improve reporting
for the measures we audited.
 Establish procedures to ensure that all relevant data are included in the
measure calculation and that the data, including data obtained from third
parties, are reasonably accurate and complete.
 Ensure that third parties involved in data collection are sufficiently
independent.
 Establish and follow clear written definitions for all measures.

Page 167 lead levels 713 verification of the completeness and reliability of the blood lead data
(>10ug/dl)
compiled in its tracking system. Consequently, there was no assurance
that the data used by FHA to determine the performance measure was
complete and reliable. Specifically, no process was in place to ensure that
blood lead data for all children under 6 years of age were collected.
FHA obtained the data for blood lead results from MDE’s Childhood
Lead Registry (CLR). However, MDE did not ensure that it had obtained
data for all eligible children for the CLR. For example, MDE provided
CLR data to the State Medicaid unit to match against Medicaid’s data
records since children on Medicaid are required to receive blood lead
testing. Using this data, Medicaid annually provides MDE with a detailed
listing of children ages 0 to 18 years of age receiving blood lead testing
per the Medicaid records that were not included in MDE’s CLR. The
listing of calendar year 2008 data noted 11,696 children that were on the
Medicaid records for blood lead testing but were not included in the CLR.
While we were unable to readily determine how many of these children
were under 6 years of age and had elevated blood levels, the fact these
children were not in the CLR is an indication that the records used to
calculate this measure were not complete. MDE personnel informed us
that they did not use the Medicaid information to ensure the CLR was
accurate and complete. The CLR included approximately 119,000
children less than 19 years of age tested for blood lead during calendar
year 2008.

increase tremendously with increasing age, age-adjustment eliminates the confounding effect of age when comparing rates. This is a standard methodology used by all major
cancer programs, including the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

information was reported to determine whether the positive test result
should be included in the performance measure. (The 14 cases were all
from the one local health department that did not report detailed data
about the positive test results.) Since not all positive test results are
included3, local health departments need to provide case details (such as
symptoms, test dates) to enable IDEHA to determine which cases should
be included in the measure. Information subsequently obtained from this
one local department demonstrated that the 14 cases were properly
counted. As a result, we determined that the reported result was
reasonably accurate. According to DHMH records, for calendar year
2008, there were 1,089 positive syphilis tests, of which 378 were
classified as primary and secondary.

symptoms usually appear from 10 days to 10 weeks after infection.

description indicates the measurement of the decrease in substance use
after a patient exits a treatment program; however, the calculation
actually measures the percent of patients who are drug free after exiting a
treatment program, as intended.
Furthermore, the methodology used by Alcohol and Drug Abuse

abuse treatment centers to verify the reported data provided the center
with advanced information about the patient records to be audited. To
ensure the integrity of the audit process, treatment centers should not be

Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Scope
Under the authority of the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, we conducted an audit of selected performance
measure results reported in the Maryland fiscal year 2011 operating budget
request. The audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, we are
systematically auditing the performance measures from the 2005 Managing for
Results - State Comprehensive Plan produced by the Department of Budget and
Management (DBM). This Plan included 62 performance measures categorized
into five functional areas referred to as pillars.4 This audit is the fourth to be
conducted pursuant to this request and focuses on the 13 performance measures
from the Health functional area as reported by DBM in its Managing for Results
Annual Performance Report.
Objectives
The objectives of our audit were (1) to determine whether the most recent actual
measurement results for the selected performance measures were accurately
reported in the Maryland fiscal year 2011 operating budget request, and (2) to
determine whether adequate control systems existed over the collection and
reporting of the data related to the measurement results. Our performance audit
did not include an assessment of whether the performance measures reviewed
were consistent with the goals and objectives of the related programs, or were
meaningful indicators of program performance.
Methodology
To accomplish our objectives, we interviewed Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene (DHMH) and Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE)
personnel responsible for collecting and reporting the measure data, reviewed
performance measure calculations for accuracy, reviewed the data collected and
reported for the performance measures, and determined whether the calculations
4 DBM reissued the State Comprehensive Plan in November 2009 with 98 performance measures
categorized into six functional areas. The measures under this new Plan will generally be
reported on by State agencies beginning with the fiscal year 2012 budget cycle.
15

--- Page 18 ---
and data were consistent with the definitions of the performance measures as
noted in Exhibit 1. We also analyzed DHMH’s and MSDE’s performance
measurement data collection and reporting activities to evaluate whether proper
controls existed to ensure data integrity.
We developed a system to categorize the results of our audit of performance
measures. The four categories represent varying levels of certification of the
accuracy of the performance reported. The categories of performance
certification are defined in Exhibit 2. If, during the course of our audit of a
measure, we found circumstances that would require us to conclude that factors
prevented certification of the measure, we did not perform additional audit work
that may have disclosed other factors that might have adversely impacted the
reported results.
Our fieldwork was conducted on site at DHMH and MSDE during the period
from January 2010 to August 2010. The responses from DHMH and MSDE to
our findings and recommendations appear as appendices in this report. As
prescribed in State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, we will advise DHMH and MSDE regarding the results of our review
of their responses.

Measure
Infant mortality Infant mortality is the death of a person from birth through one year
rate for all races of age. The infant mortality rate is calculated by dividing the number
(per 1,000 live of infant deaths by the number of live births in the same year then
births) multiplying by 1,000. Data for this measure are based on the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s (DHMH) vital records
system.
Rate of live births This measure is calculated by dividing the number of live births to
to adolescents mothers of ages 15 – 19 years (according to the DHMH vital records
between 15 and 19 system) by the number of females of ages 15 – 19 years in the
years of age (per population in the same calendar year (according to the U.S. Census
1,000 women) Bureau) and multiplying by 1,000.
Number of The Maryland Department of the Environment’s statewide Childhood
children under 6 Lead Registry (CLR) performs childhood blood lead surveillance for
years of age with Maryland. The CLR is supposed to receive the reports of all blood
elevated blood lead tests done on Maryland children 0 to 18 years of age from the
lead levels laboratories that perform the tests, as required by the Environment
(>10ug/dl) Article, Section 6-303 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. An
elevated blood lead level is any level greater than or equal to 10
micrograms per deciliter.
5 The definitions are substantially derived from those provided to the Department of Budget and Management
(DBM) in annual State agencies’ Managing for Results budget submissions and DBM’s Managing for Results
Annual Performance Report. Additional information, such as data sources, was included in certain definitions in
this exhibit for informational purposes. Also, certain definitions were shortened to enhance readability.

Measure
Cumulative percent Data for the measure comes from biennial surveys administered by a
change from the contractor in the last quarter of the calendar year. Upon completion
calendar year 2000 of survey administration, the survey results are then weighted (for
baseline for example, by the enrollment of the school, number of classes selected
underage high and participating) and analyzed at both the jurisdiction and state
school students levels to produce weighted estimates of the tobacco use behavior. A
smoking cigarettes student who indicates they smoked during the past 30 days is
considered a current smoker. The numerator for the measure is the
weighted number of students that indicated that they had smoked a
cigarette during the past 30 days and the denominator is the weighted
number of students that responded to the question. Finally, the
percentage change between calendar year 2000 and the current
calendar year is calculated.
Overall cancer The measure is calculated by dividing the number of deaths from
mortality rate per cancer during a given year by the total Maryland population (of the
100,000 persons same year), and multiplying by 100,000. The rate is then age

Percent change in Data for the measure are obtained from health care entities (such as
number of new laboratories, health care facilities, and physicians) and recorded in the
HIV cases from automated records of HIV diagnoses by the Infectious Disease and
calendar year 2007 Environmental Health Administration. The measure is calculated by
baseline subtracting the number of HIV diagnoses for the baseline calendar
year from the number of HIV diagnoses for each calendar year,
dividing that result by the number of HIV diagnoses for the baseline
calendar year and multiplying that result by 100.

who report mental surveys of consumers’ satisfaction with public mental health system
health services (PMHS) services. The survey population consists of PMHS recipients
have allowed them for whom claims are received for services rendered in the 12 months
to deal more prior to the survey. The sample is stratified by age, service type, and
effectively with county of residence. Individuals are supposed to be selected
daily problems randomly from among these groups. The measure is reported as a
percentage and is calculated as the number of individuals who
respond ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with the statement divided by the
total number of individuals who respond to the survey.

Categories of Performance Certification
Category Definition
Certified Reported performance was reasonably accurate.
Certified with Reported performance was reasonably accurate even though
Qualification minor deficiencies were noted with the supporting
documentation, controls were not sufficient, or the methodology
used to calculate reported performance was not consistent with
the measure definition.
Inaccurate Reported performance differed significantly from actual
performance; the calculation process was wrong, such as
excluding data relevant to the calculation; or, as reported, the
measure was misleading, such as failing to disclose the measure
as a rate when applicable.
Factors Prevented Reported performance could not be verified, as documentation
Certification was unavailable, controls were not adequate to ensure the
accuracy of the results, or results were not presented in a manner
consistent with the performance measure description.

Performance Measure:
Number of children under 6 years of age with elevated blood levels (less than or equal to
10 ug/dl)
Calendar Year 2008 Actual Results Reported: 713
Level of Certification: Factors Prevented Certification
Administration’s Response:
FHA concurs with the recommendations. The Administration will establish procedures to ensure
that all relevant data are included in the measure calculation and that the data, including data
obtained from the third parties, are reasonably accurate and complete. The Administration will
also ensure that third parties involved in data collection are sufficiently independent as well as
establish and follow clear written definitions for all measures.
As statutory authority for administering the Maryland Childhood Lead Registry (CLR) lies with
the Maryland Department of the Environment, FHA will make recommendations to and work
with MDE to improve these quality assurance processes. Specifically, FHA has already begun
these discussions with MDE and will recommend that: (a) Medicaid data on children receiving
blood lead testing be used to update the CLR, and (b) an audit process be established for
randomly comparing blood lead data compiled in MDE’s tracking system with blood lead results
being generated by laboratories and clinics in order to verify the reliability of the data.

Performance Measure:
Cumulative percent change from the calendar year 2000 baseline for underage high school
students smoking cigarettes.
Calendar Year 2008 Actual Results Reported: -33.5%
Level of Certification: Certified with Qualification
Administration’s Response:
FHA concurs with the recommendations. The Administration will establish procedures to ensure
that all relevant data are included in the measure calculation and that the data, including data
obtained from the third parties, are reasonably accurate and complete. The Administration will
also ensure that third parties involved in data collection are sufficiently independent as well as
establish and follow clear written definitions for all measures.
FHA will verify the reliability of third-party data beginning with the 2010-2011 administration
of the Maryland Youth Tobacco Survey. Given the need to protect the confidentiality and
anonymity of the surveyed students, as well as budgetary constraints/lack of staff to perform
audits, the following procedure will be instituted: (a) randomly select 60 student responses from
the survey database submitted to FHA by the contractor; (b) request the contractor to retrieve
from secure storage the sealed packets that contain the answer sheets for those students; (c) in the
presence of FHA staff, review one-by-one the list of selected records and unseal the packet
containing it, photocopy the response sheet, and reseal the packet; (d) once copies of all selected
answer sheets have been made, the contractor shall return all packets to secure storage; (e) FHA
staff will compare the responses on the photocopied answer sheet to those recorded for that
answer sheet in the database; (f) utilize the findings from the comparison of all randomly
selected records to verify the reliability of the data.

February 2011
Performance Measure:
Percent change in number of new HIV cases from calendar year 2007 baseline
Calendar Year 2008 Actual Results Reported: –2.0%
Level of Certification: Certified with Qualification
Administration’s Response:
The Administration partially concurs with the recommendations and concurs with the
comments/causes.
The Annotated Code of Maryland, Health-General Article, §§18-201.1, 18-202.1, and 18-205
requires laboratories and other providers to report positive test results on specimens obtained
from Maryland residents for all 80+ reportable diseases (over 40,000 lab reports annually).
However, Maryland law doesn’t require either DHMH or local health departments (LHDs), nor
is the Administration or LHDs staffed or otherwise resourced, to periodically visit or audit the
600+ laboratories licensed to perform these tests. We must rely on reporting entities to comply
with the law. As the use of electronic laboratory reporting becomes more prevalent, the
Administration expects the completeness of reporting to improve. Also, the Administration will
continue its efforts to expand electronic reporting by Maryland laboratories. The Administration
will continue to ensure that reportable data received are included in the measure and that
appropriate procedures are followed to ensure accurate calculations.
In twelve of the twenty-four LHDs, IDEHA Center for HIV Surveillance and Epidemiology staff
are assigned to perform the surveillance activities for the local jurisdiction. In those twelve
jurisdictions, site visits are not conducted as the LHD does not perform the quality reviews of
medical provider reporting of HIV. For those remaining twelve LHDs, site reviews are
conducted periodically and the Administration will ensure that the results of its reviews as they
relate to this measure are documented.
The Administration receives reportable disease case reports directly from laboratories and other
providers and/or through the LHDs. All of these entities are sufficiently independent.

--- Page 35 ---
The Administration already uses written standard national definitions for reportable infectious
diseases. As reported to the auditors, the Administration uses the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists (CSTE)/U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case
definitions for these cases. These definitions are available from the CDC Website at the
following URL: http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/od/ai/casedef/case_definitions.htm. In addition, this
performance measure has a data definition and procedure description in the MFR documentation.

appropriate procedures are followed to ensure accurate calculations.
The “one local health department” referenced by the auditor receives a separate grant directly
from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for sexually transmitted
infections (STI). As a separate CDC grantee, this LHD maintains case data at the local level and
is responsible for adhering to the same standards as IDEHA (which receives case reports from
the other 23 local health departments) in determining whether a reported case meets the criteria
for inclusion in the measure. IDEHA has access to the STI case data maintained by this LHD
and includes data in the reported measure.
The Administration receives reportable disease case reports directly from laboratories and other
providers and/or through the LHDs. All of these entities are sufficiently independent.

definitions for these cases. These definitions are available from the CDC Website at the
following URL: http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/od/ai/casedef/case_definitions.htm.
For hepatitis B, the overall prevalence for chronic infection is high; therefore, it is likely that
most of the reports do not represent acute infection. Given limited resources and the limited
public health benefit of investigating chronic hepatitis B cases, LHDs nationally investigate in
general only those cases where additional information indicates an acute case. In the future,
DHMH will be modifying the MFR measure to “perinatal hepatitis B” cases as this is a more
appropriate indicator for measuring public health impact.
Finally, as part of the FY 2013 budget process, the Administration will formally adopt and
submit to DBM a data definition for each vaccine preventable disease reported in this measure.
In this regard, the Administration will ensure that cases reported in the future to DHMH by
LHDs meet the applicable data definition for inclusion as a reportable case.

Administration’s Response:
ADAA concurs with the auditor’s recommendation to establish procedures to ensure that all
relevant data are included in the measure calculation and that the data, including data obtained
from the third parties, are reasonably accurate and complete. ADAA is currently implementing
an electronic screen for reporting of critical performance measures that will tie them directly to
each enrollment and disenrollment from a treatment level of care and significantly enhance
ability to connect appropriate documentation to dates of entry and departure from levels of care.
This will also facilitate ADAA’s review of providers’ performance-measure results and
provision of appropriate feedback.
ADAA concurs with this recommendation to ensure that third parties involved in data collection
are sufficiently independent. In the coming year, ADAA will be revising its entire data-
validation process to include a more thorough in-house component and on-site procedures as
needed. When records are reviewed on-site, there will be no advance information given to
treatment centers regarding the records to be reviewed.
ADAA concurs with the auditor’s recommendation to establish and follow clear written
definitions for all measures. Some of the wording used in measure definitions was less than
precise. ADAA will review all definitions and ensure they are entirely descriptive of the relevant

interest with the ASO performing the data collection for the consumer perception of care survey.
During the next ASO procurement process MHA will review and determine if there is a cost
effective way to assure that the data collection and survey completion are performed by a more
independent third party than the current ASO's subcontractor.
Lastly, MHA concurs with the recommendation to establish and follow clear written definitions

Performance Measure:
Number of people with disabilities who achieved successful employment through assistance by the
Department of Education’s Disability Rehabilitation Services rehabilitation programs.
Comment:
We agree with the Finding and Recommendation. MSDE’s data definition for this Performance Measure is
based on criteria prescribed by federal regulations. The agency agrees that the supporting documentation (for
example, pay stubs) was not on file for seven of the twenty nine cases tested. However, for each of the seven
cases, counselors did perform verification, albeit on a verbal basis, with the consumer and subsequent wage
checks did verify that successful employment had occurred for each case. To strengthen controls regarding this
issue, revisions have been made to Section 1001.11 (Closure-Achievement of an Employment Outcome) of the
Rehabilitation Services Manual 2 which will ensure that employment verifications are properly performed and
that adequate documentation is kept in file to support consumers’ achievement of employment. The revised
procedures became effective June 14, 2010.
