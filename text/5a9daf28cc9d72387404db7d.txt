Background
(cid:190) Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA),
through the Medical Assistance Program, provides
access to a broad range of health care benefits to
eligible Maryland residents.
(cid:190) MCPA served 881,000 individuals as of 6/30/10,
through over 40,000 providers.
(cid:190) FY 2010 Medicaid expenditures totaled
approximately $6.8 billion:
(cid:131) $2.6 billion - capitation payments to managed care
organizations
(cid:131) $1.1 billion - long-term care expenditures
(cid:131) $3.1 billion - fee-for-service expenditures
At least 50 percent of the expenditures was
recovered from the federal government

Audit Overview
(cid:190) The audit report included 14 findings, two of which
were repeated from our preceding audit report.
(cid:190) The preceding audit report noted that MCPA’s
accountability and compliance level was
unsatisfactory. This audit, MCPA improved its fiscal
operations and its accountability and compliance
level is no longer unsatisfactory.
(cid:190) In November 2009, we issued a performance audit
report on the processing of certain Medicaid claims.
OLA identified a number of enhancements to the
claims payments and edits areas, and during our
current audit we did not follow-up on certain prior
fiscal compliance audit report findings addressed in
the performance audit and limited our review in
these areas.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Lack of comprehensive policies and procedures to
monitor the eligibility process and to correct
certain long-term deficiencies associated with that
process.
(cid:190) Managed Care Organization provider/enrollee
encounter data which impact amounts paid to
MCOs were not properly verified, nor were third-
party recovery/cost avoidance efforts.
(cid:190) Inadequate procedures over claims for Medicaid
recipients with Medicare coverage, adjustments to
claim amounts, and the data entry of sensitive
claims information.
(cid:190) Lack of proper controls over other areas including
cost settlements, pharmacy drug costs, the Kidney
Disease and Transportation Grant programs,
provider applications and web based information
technology applications.

Recipient Eligibility
Background:
(cid:190) DHMH and DHR maintain a longstanding
memorandum of understanding (MOU) which
assigns responsibility to DHR for determining
applicants’ eligibility for participation in the
Medical Assistance Program.
(cid:190) Applicant eligibility is primarily determined by the
various local departments of social services
(LDSS) under the supervision of DHR.
(cid:190) DHMH is responsible for establishing regulations,
guidelines, and procedures to be used by DHR for
Medical Assistance applicants.

Recipient Eligibility
(continued)
Deficiencies with the eligibility process and related
monitoring have been commented upon in MCPA
audit reports dating back to 1992 and in our audit
reports of several DHR units. (Finding 1) During this
audit, we noted that:
(cid:190) 6,737 active recipients were missing social
security numbers as of June 17, 2009.
(cid:190) 424 individuals had two or more recipient
numbers on MMIS II. Our test of 11 of these
individuals disclosed that, for 9, MCPA paid
capitation fees (that is, a per-person payment)
totaling $137,000 under both recipient numbers,
resulting in overpayments of $63,000.
(cid:190) Most of the 802,271 fiscal year 2009 recipients
did not have an eligibility ending date recorded in
MMIS II.

Recipient Eligibility
(continued)
These conditions occurred, at least in part, due to
shortcomings in the MOU, which:
(cid:190) Did not provide MCPA with sufficient responsibility
for monitoring eligibility determinations.
(cid:131) MCPA did not independently monitor the
eligibility process using available data.
(cid:131) MCPA monitoring was generally limited to
reviews of DHR’s quality control efforts.
(cid:190) Did not establish specific responsibilities to
ensure deficiencies were corrected.
(cid:131) MCPA notified DHR of deficiencies but did not
address DHRs failure to correct the problems.
(cid:190) Has not been updated since the MOU’s inception
in July 1985 and several provisions are no longer
accurate or applicable.

HealthChoice
(Managed Care Organizations)
Background:
(cid:190) Under HealthChoice, qualified recipients are
required to enroll in one of seven managed care
organizations (MCOs).
(cid:190) As of June 30, 2009, 70% of all Medicaid
recipients (555,000) were enrolled in MCOs.
(cid:190) MCPA pays the MCOs a fixed monthly payment
(capitation), for which the MCOs are generally
expected to pay the recipients’ medical costs
regardless of the number or nature of services
provided.
(cid:190) Each MCO must report all provider-enrollee
(medical) encounters which is one of the factors
used in the determination of the capitation rates.

Health Choice
(continued)
(cid:190) MCPA did not verify encounter data submitted by
the MCOs for calendar years 2005 through 2007
(which was a factor used in developing the CY
2008 to 2010 capitation rates) and did not
follow up on errors noted during its review of
calendar year 2004 encounter data. (Finding 2)
The lack of verification was commented upon in
our two preceding audit reports.
(cid:190) MCPA did not ensure that the MCOs were
maximizing their efforts to help reduce
expenditures through third-party recoveries and
cost avoidance efforts, and did not ensure that
the MCOs were properly reporting the related
results. (Finding 3) The reduction of these
expenditures through recoveries and cost
avoidance efforts could lower future capitation
rates.

Claims Processing
(cid:190) MCPA did not verify the propriety of the Medicaid
claims submitted for Medicaid recipients who
also had Medicare coverage to ensure that
payments for these claims were proper. (Finding
5) From 7/1/08 to 5/30/09, MCPA processed
more than 2 million claims totaling $135 million
for such dual coverage Medicaid recipients.
Also, there were no system edits to prevent
overpayments based on incorrect claims data
entry, such as payments in excess of billed
amounts. Our analysis of claims data for such
recipients from 7/1/08 to 5/30/09 found that
MCPA paid providers more than the amount
billed for at least 372 claims totaling $231,000.
(cid:190) MCPA did not verify the propriety of claim
adjustments. (Finding 7) During FY 2009,
152,485 adjustments were processed without
independent supervisory approval.

Claims Processing (Policy Issue)
The confidentiality of certain sensitive recipient
information may not have been adequately
safeguarded. (Finding 6) MCPA contracted with the
Department of Public Safety and Correctional
Services – Maryland Correctional Enterprises (MCE)
and data entry contractor to process claims data
which contained social security numbers and other
sensitive information.
(cid:190) MCPA did not determine the nature of the crimes
committed by MCE inmates used to enter claims
data.
(cid:190) MCPA did not obtain documentation from the
data entry contractor that the required criminal
background checks had been conducted for its
personnel.

Other Issues
Maryland Medicaid Pharmacy Program
MCPA did not ensure that pharmacy
reimbursements (which totaled $271 million during
FY 2009) were reasonable. (Finding 9) MCPA’s
vendor was responsible for processing and
authorizing pharmacy claims using the most current
drug prices. MCPA did not verify the drug pricing
used by the vendor with independent sources.
Long-Term Care Cost Settlements
MCPA did not maintain a comprehensive listing of all
long-term care facilities to account for due dates
and receipt of cost settlements. MCPA also did not
ensure that all annual cost settlements were
completed by its contractor. (Finding 10)
(cid:131) Throughout the year, MCPA pays facilities using
interim rates and identifies over and
underpayments via the settlement process.
(cid:131) 246 settlements were not issued within 1 year.
(cid:131) 40 settlements dating back to 2002 were
outstanding.

Other Issues

Provider Applications
Certain healthcare provider applications were not
subject to supervisory review and approval to
ensure that the proper verification procedures
were performed. (Finding 8)
Information Technology
Adequate authentication, access, and monitoring
controls did not exist over a critical Internet web-
based IT application that allows health care
providers to electronically submit claims (Finding
13). Certain security settings were not activated
to identify, for management review, modifications
made to critical databases. (Finding 14)

Other Issues
(continued)
Kidney Disease Program
(cid:190) MCPA did not implement certain procedures and
controls to fully address deficiencies that enabled
certain fraudulent activities to occur in the Kidney
Disease Program over a ten-year period. In
February 2009, a KDP employee was convicted of
misappropriating $1.8 million by processing
fictitious KDP claims. (Finding 11)
(cid:190) Other procedural deficiencies over KDP
pharmaceutical claims resulted in overpayments
of at least $161,744 to one pharmacy and the
referral of this provider to the Office of Attorney
General – Criminal Division.
(cid:190) During FY 2009, KDP expended $12.5 million to
provide financial assistance to eligible end-stage
renal disease patients.

Other Issues
(continued)
Transportation Grant Program
(cid:190) Numerous deficiencies were noted with MCPA’s
oversight of the Program which provides grants to
local jurisdictions to provide Medicaid recipients with
non-emergency transportation to and from providers
rendering Medicaid-covered services. MCPA paid the
24 local jurisdictions $32.5 million during FY 2009
under the program. (Finding 12)
(cid:190) Local jurisdictions were not prohibited from hiring the
same vendor to perform the functions of screening
and transporting of applicants. This situation existed
in 11 jurisdictions that received $6.3 million in FY
2009.
(cid:190) Vendors were not required to maintain sufficient
documentation to support the propriety of the
transport.
(cid:190) MCPA site visits to monitor the local jurisdictions
were not comprehensive or timely. One jurisdiction
that received about 30% of all grants in FY 2009 had
not been visited for over 4 years.

Conclusion
MCPA should:
(cid:190) Update the MOU with DHR and establish
comprehensive policies and procedures to
monitor the eligibility process and to correct
long-term deficiencies.
(cid:190) Verify MCO encounter data and better monitor
third-party recovery/cost avoidance efforts.

for recipients with Medicare coverage, claims
adjustments and sensitive claims information.
(cid:190) Implement adequate controls to address the
other deficiencies noted in the report including
Pharmacy drug costs, Cost Settlements, Kidney
Disease and Transportation Grant programs,
provider application processing and IT systems.
