Office of Legislative Audits
Accountability and Compliance Rating System
HISTORY:
• In 1981, the Joint Budget and Audit Committee requested the Legislative Auditor to
establish a methodology to help assess the fiscal performance of State agencies with
regard to accounting records and practices, and their level of compliance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Committee's request was based on its
growing dissatisfaction with the level of accountability and compliance on the part of
State agencies.
• The 1983 Joint Chairmen's Report recommended that for all agencies receiving an
unsatisfactory rating designation, a follow-up examination be performed to verify
corrections of the audit deficiencies.
• A law enacted in 1985 (Chapter 556, Laws of Maryland, 1985, effective July 1, 1985)
formalized the Legislative Auditor's use of a rating system. Specifically, the law stated
that the Office of Legislative Audits may develop an overall evaluation of a unit's
financial transactions and records, and compliance with applicable laws and orders as
a means of comparing the various units of State government. The law was amended
in 1997 (Chapters 635 and 636, Laws of Maryland, 1997, effective July 1, 1997). As
a result, Title 2-1221(e) of the State Government Article states that this Office shall
develop and use a rating system upon the approval of the Joint Audit Committee. The
Committee approved the continued use of the rating system during the 1997 Interim.
• The audit rating process and the related results are annually reviewed by the Joint
Audit Committee to assist in performing its oversight responsibilities.
GUIDELINES:
• Guidelines for establishing agency accountability and compliance ratings were
developed by this Office and have been reviewed by the Joint Audit Committee. No
changes are being recommended at this time.
CURRENT STATUS OF AGENCIES WITH UNSATISFACTORY RATINGS:
• There are currently two agencies with unsatisfactory ratings – see page 2 for the list of
these agencies and related comments regarding follow-up audit efforts. No
recommendations are being made at this time for the Joint Audit Committee.
CONCLUSION:
• The Office will continue using the rating system unless otherwise directed by the
Committee.
