Background Information
Video Lottery Facilities
The General Assembly passed legislation to license video lottery terminal (VLT)
gaming in Maryland at six locations in the State (Anne Arundel County,
Baltimore City, Cecil County, Allegany County, Worcester County, and Prince
George’s County). Current law authorizes 16,500 VLTs with a maximum of
4,750 VLTs at any one location, and allows VLT licensees to operate certain
table games such as roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and poker. VLT equipment
is owned or leased by either the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control
Commission (MLGCC) or the VLT licensees.
The video lottery operation licenses required by law to operate a VLT facility
were awarded by the Video Lottery Facility Location Commission. The MLGCC
oversees VLT facility operations, and is required to ensure that licensees
comply with the regulatory framework of the VLT program, including minority
business participation.
Minority Requirements Studies
Section 4 of Chapter 4, Special Session, and Laws of Maryland 2007 required
the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), in consultation with the
General Assembly and the Office of the Attorney General, to initiate two
studies to evaluate the continued compliance of the minority participation
requirements of Section 9-1A-10 of the State Government Article with any
federal and constitutional requirements. The studies were also to evaluate
race-neutral programs or other methods that could be used to address the
needs of minority investors and minority businesses. The first study was
submitted to the Legislative Policy Committee by the Secretary of MDOT with a
letter (dated August 9, 2011), to address the aforementioned Special Session
requirements. In response to the completion of the first study, the Attorney
General of Maryland advised on August 11, 2011 that a minority business
participation program for VLT licensees could now be implemented in
compliance with the VLT law.
The report of the second study was due to the Committee by September 30,
2013. In a letter dated November 20, 2013, the Secretary of MDOT notified
the Legislative Policy Committee that the second study would not be
completed. The letter stated that the 2011 study fulfills the obligations for
the studies outlined in the law.

Minority Participation Requirements
Section 9-1A-10 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland specifies that, for construction and procurements related to the
operation of VLTs, video lottery operation licensees must meet, at a minimum,
the same minority participation requirements specified for State agencies in
Title 14, Subtitle 3 of the State Finance and Procurement Article. According to
this law, if the Governor’s Office of Minority Affairs (GOMA) reports that a
licensee is not in compliance with the minority participation requirements,
MLGCC may take immediate action to ensure compliance of the licensee.
The request for proposals (RFP) issued in December 2008 by the Video
Lottery Facility Location Commission delineated the minority participation
goals, with overall goals of 25 percent for Allegany, Cecil, and Worcester
counties, and 35 percent for Anne Arundel County and Baltimore City, and
sub-goals for African-American and women-owned businesses. However,
because of constitutionality issues, the Attorney General advised, on August
11, 2011, that the RFP provisions relating to these goals needed to be
amended to set separate goals for each VLT facility and, where appropriate,
for each separate contract of significant duration, scope, and size entered into
by licensees. This advice also stated that these goals need to be based on
the availability of minority businesses to perform the work at each location,
and waivers must be available for instances in which a licensee is unable to
meet the goals after making good faith efforts.
To address the requirements and prior legal concerns noted in the Attorney
General’s August 2011 memorandum, MLGCC worked collaboratively with
other State agencies and stakeholders, including GOMA and MDOT, to
develop an amended Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) goal-setting process.
MDOT’s current role in the goal-setting process is to apply a proprietary goal-
setting formula, that had been developed in 2013 by a consultant, under
contract with the State. The results from applying this formula are then
submitted by MDOT to MLGCC, which is responsible for formally adopting and
notifying VLT licensees of the actual goals.
Status of Licenses
For each casino, Table 1 provides the dates that the license was awarded and
when VLT gaming operations began. In accordance with Section 9-1A-04 of
the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, MLGCC
granted MGM National Harbor (MGM) in Prince George’s County two six-month
extensions to begin its VLT gaming operations; MGM is now required to open
no later than February 14, 2017.

Section 9-1A-10 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires GOMA to monitor licensees’ compliance with minority
business participation requirements and to report at least every six months to
the MLGCC on the licensees’ compliance with the requirements. MLGCC uses
the information obtained from GOMA to prepare an annual report to the
Governor and the General Assembly on the attainment of the minority
business participation goals by the licensees and their efforts to maintain
those goals. MLGCC’s report for calendar year 2014 was issued on October
30, 2015.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the three findings
contained in our preceding audit report, dated April 5, 2016. We determined
two of these findings were satisfactorily addressed. The remaining finding is
repeated in this report, although progress was made by MLGCC to address the
issue.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Scope and Objectives
Section 9-1A-34 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland required the Office of Legislative Audits to annually audit and
evaluate the information submitted by video lottery operation licensees to the
Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (MLGCC) on the attainment
of minority business participation goals specified for construction and
procurements related to their operations and the efforts to maintain those
goals. We conducted a performance audit to assess the accuracy of the
calendar year 2014 information reported by the six video lottery operation
licensees identified in Table 2.

Our audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe
that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Methodology
To accomplish our objectives, we interviewed employees of the licensees,
MLGCC, and the Governor’s Office of Minority Affairs (GOMA). We reviewed
GOMA’s and MLGCC’s data collection process and reporting. We also
evaluated the minority participation calculations for accuracy, and reviewed
and tested the records of the licensees, including contractor classifications,
expenditure data, invoices, and reports of minority participation levels.
Our fieldwork was completed during the period from October 2015 through
July 2016. A copy of the draft report was provided to MLGCC and GOMA.
MLGCC’s responses to our findings and recommendations appear as an
appendix to this report. Since there were no recommendations made to
GOMA, it did not submit responses to this report. As prescribed in State
Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we
will advise MLGCC regarding the results of our review of its responses.
Finally, Chapter 49, 2016 Laws of Maryland, eliminated the requirement that
the Office of Legislative Audits annually audit and evaluate the information
submitted by licensees to MLGCC. Consequently, this is the final audit report
to be issued on the attainment of minority business participation goals by
video lottery operation licensees, and their efforts to maintain those goals.
Nevertheless, the aforementioned MLGCC responses and the attainment of
goals will be subject to audit and evaluation during this Office’s regularly
required fiscal compliance audits of MLGCC, conducted in accordance with
Section 2-1220 (a) (2) of the State Government Article.

Conclusions
As of June 30, 2016, 10 of the 18 VLT minority participation goals had been
established, and certain actions have been taken to establish most of the
remaining goals. Without properly established goals, the Maryland Lottery
and Gaming Control Commission (MLGCC) will be unable to encourage and
assess licensee achievement of those goals, or for a licensee failing to
achieve those goals, take appropriate action to ensure compliance.
MLGCC was in the process of establishing an additional five amended
minority participation goals for five video lottery terminal licensees (including
four goals for four of the video lottery terminal licensees that incurred
expenditures in calendar year 2014). MLGCC had taken no action to
establish the remaining three goals, but there was no reported calendar year
2014 expenditure activity related to these specific goals.
For the five goals in process, MLGCC had completed the necessary tasks to
establish four of these amended goals, and had submitted the information to
the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT). MDOT is responsible for
applying a proprietary goal-setting formula, on which the goals are based, and
submitting the amended participation goals to MLGCC for final approval. For
the other goal, MLGCC was gathering and verifying licensee information prior
to submission to MDOT. Table 4 presents the status of all 18 goals as of June
30, 2016.
Our evaluation of the video lottery terminal (VLT) information, which included
minority business participation data received directly from the licensees or
Governor’s Office of Minority Affairs (GOMA), indicated that the information
published by GOMA in its 2014 MBE compliance report, dated September 30,
2015, was generally accurate and complete. We also found that GOMA had a
process in place to review the VLT information received directly from the
licensees to ensure that the licensees’ information was complete and
accurate. MLGCC used the information provided by GOMA in preparing its
annual report, dated October 30, 2015, for calendar year 2014 on the VLT
facilities’ participation activity. MLGCC audited the VLT information received
directly from the licensees and GOMA to verify the information that was
included in its annual report to the Governor and General Assembly. Neither
MLGCC’s and GOMA’s reviews of the submitted licensee information nor our
audit disclosed any related findings that warranted mention in this report.
Table 3 includes a summary of the applicable licensee submitted information.

Since the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore began operations on August 26, 2014,
the “Operations” financial activity reported in Table 3 is not for a full calendar
year. Also, on December 23, 2013, the Video Lottery Facility Location
Commission awarded a VLT license to MGM National Harbor, LLC. The
“Architectural/Engineering” and “Construction” activity shown in Table 3 for
this casino, as disclosed by GOMA in its report, includes both calendar years
2013 and 2014. Both years were included because calendar year 2013 was
not previously included in GOMA’s report for that year.

Findings and Recommendations
Establishment of Minority Participation Requirements
Finding 1
Certain amended minority participation goals for five of the video lottery
terminal licensees with related calendar year expenditures were not yet
established.
Analysis
Certain amended calendar year 2014 minority participation goals had not
been established for five video lottery terminal (VLT) licensees; including four
goals for which there were calendar year 2014 expenditures. Each of the six
licensees should have three goals established – one each related to
architectural/engineering, construction, and operational procurement
activities, resulting in a total of 18 goals. As of June 30, 2016, 10 goals had
been established, 5 goals were in process, and 3 goals (for which there was
no calendar year 2014 financial activity) had not been established. See Table
4 for a status of the goals by licensee and activity type.
For the five goals in process as of June 30, 2016, the Maryland Lottery and
Gaming Control Commission (MLGCC) had completed the necessary tasks in
its efforts to establish four, including the operational/procurements goals for
four of the licensees. Specifically, MLGCC requested licensees to provide
certain budgetary data that was necessary to the goal setting methodology
formula, which MLGCC verified for accuracy upon receipt from the licensees.
For those four, MLGCC submitted the related licensee data and additional
information required by the goal setting methodology to the Maryland
Department of Transportation (MDOT). Under an agreement between MLGCC,
GOMA and MDOT, MDOT is responsible for applying a proprietary goal-setting
formula, on which the goals are based, and submitting the amended
participation goals to MLGCC for final approval. We found that MLGCC was
working on gathering or verifying licensee data for the other goal, but that
data was not fully ready for submission to MDOT.

 - There were calendar year 2014 expenditures related to the four goals “Pending at MDOT” as
of June 30, 2016.
 - Activity type did not have any calendar year 2014 expenditures.
Although State law requires VLT licensees to meet the same minority
participation requirements specified for State agencies, the Attorney General
of Maryland formally advised in August 2011 that, to address constitutionality
issues, MLGCC should amend the goals to set separate goals for each
licensee, and perhaps for each contract, and consider the proposed contract
work and the availability of minority businesses to perform the work.
A similar condition was commented upon in our two preceding audit reports,
in which we commented that certain goals had not been established, although
MLGCC was committed to establishing all necessary goals.
12

--- Page 15 ---
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MLGCC establish amended minority participation goals
for all categories in which VLT licensees have expenditures (repeat).
