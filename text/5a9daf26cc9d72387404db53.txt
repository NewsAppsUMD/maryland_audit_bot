REPORTS FOR WHICH COMMITTEE ACTION IS RECOMMENDED
SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
DECEMBER 1, 2008 TO JUNE 30, 2009
1) Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) (12/8/08 – 26 pages – 15 findings)
• The Maryland Health Insurance Plan (MHIP), which operated within MIA prior to
October 1, 2008, did not achieve cost savings, estimated to total approximately
$300,000 during fiscal year 2007, because MHIP’s third party administrator did not
implement a pharmacy benefits exclusion when imposed by MHIP. Under this
exclusion, new MHIP participants would, for a specified period of time, be denied
pharmacy benefits relating to pre-existing conditions. (Effective October 1, 2008, MHIP
became an independent unit of State government.)
• MHIP did not verify that the administrator met certain contract performance standards,
such as time limits for making eligibility determinations for MHIP applicants and for
paying claims.
• MHIP made a claim for approximately $1.4 million against its former third party
administrator for overpayment of benefit claims. The former administrator is disputing
this claim, which was based on the results of a claim audit conducted by a consulting
firm hired by MHIP.
• Controls over insurance producer licensing were not sufficient. For example, certain
employees had system access which allowed them to process and approve licensing
applications without independent review and approval.
• MIA did not adequately monitor certain critical provisions of its contract for the testing of
insurance agent and broker candidates. As a result, MIA was underpaid approximately
$71,000 in test fees during fiscal year 2008.
• Controls over the processing of non-cash credit adjustments to MIA’s accounts
receivable records were not sufficient. For example, output reports of processed credits
were not generated and verified to supporting documentation. Our testing of selected
credits disclosed two credits totaling approximately $154,000 which had been issued in
error.
• Numerous security and control deficiencies were noted with respect to MIA’s
information systems. For example, MIA’s critical network devices and administrative
systems were not protected from external and internal threats.
• MIA did not satisfactorily resolve 6 of the 16 findings in the preceding audit report.

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
DECEMBER 1, 2008 TO JUNE 30, 2009
2) Department of Budget and Management – Office of Personnel Services and Benefits
(OPSB) (2/19/09 – 30 pages – 14 findings)
• OPSB did not ensure, on a timely basis, that the required contract discounts were
obtained from the former pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) for the State’s prescription
drug benefit program. Significant potential overpayments for plan years 2005 and 2006
were identified.
• Required drug manufacturer rebates totaling approximately $700,000 were not received
from the former PBM for plan year 2006.
• OPSB had not taken any actions to determine whether its former PBM engaged in “drug
switching” activities within the State’s prescription drug plan and, if so, whether the
State incurred significantly higher and unnecessary costs.
• OPSB did not adequately pursue recovery from a third-party plan administrator of health
care benefit claim payments totaling approximately $534,000 related to possible
fraudulent medical claims submitted by certain State employees.
• Health care claim payments subsequently identified by OPSB as potentially ineligible
were not adequately followed up and resolved. For example, OPSB did not investigate
and conclude on certain claims totaling approximately $3.7 million, nor perform any
follow-up review to ensure the eligibility of $100 million in claims identified as potentially
ineligible.
• OPSB did not receive timely and complete audit reports related to the State’s health
benefit plan administrators, as required.
• Controls over key OPSB information systems were not sufficient to protect sensitive
employee and systems’ information.
• Cash receipts, which totaled $50.8 million in FY 08, were not adequately controlled.
• OPSB had not satisfactorily addressed 5 of the 14 findings in the preceding audit report.

3) Department of Housing and Community Development – Divisions of Development
Finance, Credit Assurance, and Neighborhood Revitalization (DHCD) (3/11/09 – 22
pages – 8 findings)
• Complete records of multifamily project cash flow loans were not maintained. This issue
has been commented upon in OLA reports since 1998. Consequently, there was no
single source within DHCD that provided a comprehensive record of cash flow loan
balances and related loan activity. These loans, which totaled approximately $227.6
million as of June 30, 2008, are generally funded with State funds and are only
repayable to DHCD if the project operations result in surplus cash as defined by the
loans’ regulatory agreements.
• Certain required financial reports for multifamily project loans were not always
submitted and, when submitted, were not reviewed timely to ensure that the projects
were financially stable and were operating in accordance with requirements. DHCD did
not impose permissible sanctions when required financial reports were not submitted.
• Appropriate collection actions were not taken on a delinquent Neighborhood Business
Works Program loan totaling $688,000. Additional funds were loaned to the delinquent
borrower for operating expenses without a documented analysis of project viability.
• Certain Community Legacy Program (CLP) projects were not started timely as required
by State regulations, which indicated that the projects may not have been ready to
proceed when assistance was received. According to DHCD records, 51 CLP projects
that were awarded assistance during the period from April 2005 to August 2007 totaling
$4.7 million had not requested any funds as of July 2008.
• DHCD did not obtain sufficient documentation of additional funding commitments from
other sources for projects it funded under certain financial assistance programs.
• DHCD had not satisfactorily addressed 5 of the 10 findings in the preceding audit
report.

4) Managing for Results – Performance Measures – Public Safety and Safer
Neighborhoods (Performance) (3/19/09 – 15 pages)
We conducted a performance audit to determine the accuracy of 13 measures contained
within the Public Safety and Safer Neighborhoods portion of the Managing for Results (MFR)
- State Comprehensive Plan as reported in the Maryland fiscal year 2009 operating budget
request. We also determined whether adequate control systems were in place for collecting,
summarizing, and reporting the performance measure data. The audit concluded the
following:
• For the 13 measures tested, 2 were Certified, 4 were considered Certified with
Qualification, 2 were deemed Inaccurate, and 5 were designated as Factors
Prevented Certification.
• For those measures that could not be certified, the reported results were not always
consistent with the performance measure descriptions, and documentation was not
always available to support the reported results.
• Although the various agencies had certain quality control processes in place,
adequate procedures and controls did not exist for certain measures to provide
reasonable assurance that applicable agency internal data and third party data used
for the measure results were reliable.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, OLA is in the process of
systematically auditing the results of the 62 MFR measures contained in the State
Comprehensive Plan, which was produced by the Department of Budget and Management
(DBM). This audit is the first to be conducted.
The agencies responsible for reporting these results for the 13 measures are the Department
of State Police (DSP), the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS),
the Governor’s Office for Children (GOC), the Department of Human Resources (DHR), and
the Department of Juvenile Services (DJS).

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
DECEMBER 1, 2008 TO JUNE 30, 2009
5) Subsequent Injury Fund (SIF) (4/9/09 – 20 pages – 9 findings)
• SIF had established virtually no controls over its accounts receivable records, which
were maintained for both SIF and for the Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF), resulting in
increased susceptibility to fraudulent activity. For example, the same employee was
responsible for many incompatible duties related to accounts receivable and cash
receipts. As of January 2009, the accounts receivable balance totaled $27.3 million for
both Funds.
• Accounts receivable records maintained by SIF for UEF were not adequately
maintained. Some recorded amounts did not agree with the nature of the transaction or
lacked support.
• SIF did not comply with Central Collection Unit (CCU) regulations regarding collection
activities and timely transfers to CCU for collection.
• Adequate internal control had not been established over cash receipts. The employee
who prepared the deposits also performed the deposit verifications and could modify
the initial receipt record. During fiscal year 2008, SIF deposited collections totaling
approximately $29.7 million, primarily representing payments on accounts receivable.
• Deficiencies in the automated system compromised adequate controls over financial
transactions. For example, users had incompatible capabilities on the automated
system which, when coupled with the employees’ access to cash receipts, created the
potential for misappropriation.
• SIF should improve controls over payroll preparation and ensure contractor services are
obtained and documented in accordance with State Procurement Regulations.
• SIF had not satisfactorily addressed 5 of the 9 findings in the preceding audit report.

6) Uninsured Employers’ Fund (UEF) (5/6/09 – 13 pages – 5 findings)
• UEF had not established sufficient controls over its accounts receivable records, which
are maintained on its behalf by the Subsequent Injury Fund (SIF). For example, UEF
did not have a process to ensure that all of its transactions, such as assessments,
collections and non-cash adjustments, were properly recorded in the accounts
receivable records.
• UEF did not reconcile the amounts that it had referred to the Central Collection Unit
(CCU) for collection assistance, as reflected on the accounts receivable records
maintained by SIF, with the corresponding amounts on CCU’s records. Consequently,
significant differences were noted.
• Adequate records were not maintained to facilitate debt collection efforts. The accounts
receivable system did not provide appropriate aging for UEF receivables and an
accurate and up-to-date list of delinquent accounts on payment plans was not
maintained.
• UEF did not always adequately pursue the collection of its delinquent accounts in
accordance with regulations established by CCU.
• UEF had not established adequate procedures and controls over its cash receipts,
which were received by UEF and also by SIF on UEF’s behalf. UEF mailed its cash
receipts ($296,000 during FY 2008) to SIF rather than depositing them directly. Also,
UEF did not ensure that all of its cash receipts ($6.3 million during FY 2008) were
properly deposited and recorded in the State’s accounting records.
• UEF did not perform verifications of claim payments processed for it by SIF to ensure
the payments were processed in accordance with the terms of the Workers’
Compensation Commission awards.
• UEF had not satisfactorily addressed the one finding in the preceding audit report.

7) Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund – Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008
(MALPF) (6/15/09 – 16 pages – 5 findings)
• The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) did not maintain a
comprehensive listing or operational database of all easements purchased, to ensure all
easements were properly accounted for and reported. According to MALPF’s records,
as of June 30, 2008, it had purchased 2,018 easements on 275,000 acres of land for a
total cost of approximately $556 million.
• Significant discrepancies existed between the cost of easement acquisitions reported
by the MALPF to the General Assembly and the related amount reported on the State’s
accounting records.
• MALPF lacked adequate procedures for ensuring easement acquisition prices were
properly calculated.
• County agricultural land preservation programs were not properly certified, resulting in
certain counties retaining a higher share of transfer taxes.
• MALPF did not ensure that counties properly used agricultural land transfer taxes that
had been retained by the counties in accordance with State laws and regulations, and
did not ensure that counties remitted the required amount of unused transfer taxes to
the State.
• Easement inspections were not performed in accordance with MALPF’s policy to
ensure that landowners were in compliance with the provisions stipulated in the
easement agreements.
• MALPF had not satisfactorily addressed the five findings in the preceding audit report
dated September 4, 2008.
