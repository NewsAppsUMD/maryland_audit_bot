Overview of Repeat Audit Findings
 OLA issues about 50 fiscal compliance audit reports each year containing
about 150 recommendations.
 Virtually all recommendations are accepted by agencies, although there have
been isolated disagreements.
 As of June 2024, 30% of findings were repeated in the first subsequent audit
report and 8% were repeated after the second subsequent audit. Although
there was a slight decrease in the number of repeats over the last two years,
the number of repeat findings has increased again (see Exhibit).

Follow-up Processes for Repeat Audit Findings
 State Government Article, §2-1224(h) requires agencies with 5 or more
repeat audit findings to provide
• an initial status report to OLA on corrective actions taken on all findings
within 9 months of the related audit reports and, thereafter,
• quarterly status reports until satisfactory progress has been made on all
findings, or until the next audit begins.
 Budget bill language and committee narrative (Joint Chairmen’s Report)
instituted annually since the 2013 Session, has restricted the appropriations
for agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings until
• corrective action has been taken by the agencies for the repeat findings,
and
• OLA submits reports on its determination regarding the actions taken.

SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process – Recent Results
During calendar year 2024, there were 6 audits subject to the quarterly status
report process:
 Quarterly status reports are ongoing for 3 audit reports. OLA’s review of the
most recent status reports submitted by these agencies concluded that about
45% of the collective findings are still in progress.
 Quarterly status reports for 2 audit reports initiated in October 2022 and
December 2022 have stopped because subsequent audits were started.
Satisfactory progress had not been made to address all findings based on the
most recent status reports,
 Quarterly status reports for 1 audit report were paused because OLA is
conducting a formal follow-up review since the report was rated
unsatisfactory in accordance with the rating system established by the JAEC.
Prior to this review, satisfactory progress had not been made to address all
findings based on the most recent status report.

JCR Follow-up Process – Background
 In response to JAEC concerns, beginning with the April 2013, the Chairmen of
the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and the House Appropriations
Committee included language in the annual Joint Chairmen’s Report that
restricts funding for agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings until
corrective action is taken for all the repeat findings.
 The annual amount of funds restricted for each agency is generally
$100,000, but has recently ranged as high as $500,000.
 Each of these agencies with 4 or more repeat findings must submit a status
report to OLA by November 1st.
 OLA reviews the actions taken by these agencies for each of the repeat
findings and issues a report to the budget committees with our conclusions.
 The determination of whether to release funding is at the sole discretion of
the budget committees.

JCR Follow-up Process – Recent Results
 The April 2023 JCR contained budget bill language restrictions for 4 agencies
with a combined 17 repeat findings. OLA’s review of the status reports
submitted by these agencies in calendar year 2024 concluded that all 4
agencies had not fully resolved the findings, with about 80% of the collective
findings still in progress. The budget committees did not release the restricted
funds for these agencies.
 The April 2024 JCR contained budget bill language restrictions for 5 agencies
with a combined 25 repeat findings. OLA will review the reports submitted by
these agencies and will report our conclusions regarding the corrective actions
to the budget committees during the 2025 Session.
 In addition to the above, there were budget language restrictions in April 2023
and 2024 for cybersecurity-related findings.

Conclusion
 We believe that the various follow-up processes provide useful tools to
compel State agencies to generally take meaningful corrective action to
implement audit recommendations.
 We also believe that agency vacancy rates may be contributing to the number
of repeat findings. In recent reports we have started to include vacancy
percentages and conduct analysis during the audit period to determine
potential causes when these percentages exceed 10 percent.
 Since 2009, the overall percentage of repeat audit findings has decreased
significantly to as low as 21% in 2013 but the percentage has continued to
steadily increase to 30% in 2024. OLA will continue to monitor this trend and
make any additional recommendations to the Committee in the future.
