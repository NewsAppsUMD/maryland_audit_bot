Background
(cid:190) Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA),
through the Medical Assistance Program, provides
access to a broad range of health care benefits to
eligible Maryland residents.
(cid:190) MCPA served 881,000 individuals as of 6/30/10,
through over 40,000 providers.
(cid:190) FY 2010 Medicaid expenditures totaled
approximately $6.8 billion:
(cid:131) $2.6 billion - capitation payments to managed care
organizations
(cid:131) $1.1 billion - long-term care expenditures
(cid:131) $3.1 billion - fee-for-service expenditures
At least 50 percent of the expenditures was
recovered from the federal government

Audit Overview
(cid:190) The audit report included 14 findings, two of which
were repeated from our preceding audit report.
(cid:190) The preceding audit report noted that MCPA’s
accountability and compliance level was
unsatisfactory. This audit, MCPA improved its fiscal
operations and its accountability and compliance
level is no longer unsatisfactory.
(cid:190) In November 2009, we issued a performance audit
report on the processing of certain Medicaid claims.
OLA identified a number of enhancements that
could be made to the claims payments and edits
areas. During our current audit we did not follow-up
on certain prior fiscal compliance audit report
findings addressed in the performance audit and
limited our review in these areas.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Lack of comprehensive policies and procedures
to monitor the eligibility process and to correct
certain long-term deficiencies associated with
that process.
(cid:190) Inadequate procedures over claims for Medicaid
recipients with Medicare coverage, adjustments
to claim amounts, and the data entry of
sensitive claims information.
(cid:190) Lack of proper controls over other areas
including cost settlements, pharmacy drug
costs, and the Kidney Disease and
Transportation Grant programs.

Recipient Eligibility
Background:
(cid:190) DHMH and DHR maintain a longstanding
memorandum of understanding (MOU) that
assigns responsibility to DHR for determining
applicants’ eligibility for participation in the
Medical Assistance Program.
(cid:190) Applicant eligibility is primarily determined by the
various local departments of social services
(LDSS) under the supervision of DHR.
(cid:190) DHMH is responsible for establishing regulations,
guidelines, and procedures to be used by DHR for
Medical Assistance applicants.

Recipient Eligibility
(continued)
Deficiencies with the eligibility process and related
monitoring have been commented upon in MCPA
audit reports dating back to 1992 and in our audit
reports of several DHR units. (Finding 1) During this
audit, we noted that:
(cid:190) 6,737 active recipients were missing social
security numbers as of June 17, 2009.
(cid:190) 424 individuals had two or more recipient
numbers on MMIS II. Our test of 11 of these
individuals disclosed that, for 9, MCPA paid
capitation fees (that is, a per-person payment)
totaling $137,000 under both recipient numbers,
resulting in overpayments of $63,000.
(cid:190) Most of the 802,271 fiscal year 2009 recipients
did not have an eligibility ending date recorded in
MMIS II.

Recipient Eligibility
(continued)
These conditions occurred, at least in part, due to
shortcomings in the MOU, which:
(cid:190) Did not provide MCPA with sufficient responsibility
for monitoring eligibility determinations.
(cid:131) MCPA did not independently monitor the
eligibility process using available data.
(cid:131) MCPA monitoring was generally limited to
reviews of DHR’s quality control efforts.
(cid:190) Did not establish specific responsibilities to
ensure deficiencies were corrected.
(cid:131) MCPA notified DHR of deficiencies but did not
address DHRs failure to correct the problems.
(cid:190) Has not been updated since the MOU’s inception
in July 1985 and several provisions are no longer
accurate or applicable.

Claims Processing
(cid:190) MCPA did not verify the propriety of the Medicaid
claims submitted for Medicaid recipients who
also had Medicare coverage to ensure that
payments for these claims were proper. (Finding
5) From 7/1/08 to 5/30/09, MCPA processed
more than 2 million claims totaling $135 million
for such dual coverage Medicaid recipients.
There were also no system edits to prevent
overpayments based on incorrect claims data
entry, such as payments in excess of billed
amounts. Our analysis of claims data for such
recipients from 7/1/08 to 5/30/09 found that
MCPA paid providers more than the amount
billed for at least 372 claims totaling $231,000.
(cid:190) MCPA did not verify the propriety of claim
adjustments. (Finding 7) During FY 2009,
152,485 adjustments were processed without
independent supervisory approval.

Claims Processing (Policy Issue)
The confidentiality of certain sensitive recipient
information may not have been adequately
safeguarded. (Finding 6) MCPA contracted with the
Department of Public Safety and Correctional
Services – Maryland Correctional Enterprises (MCE)
and data entry contractor to process claims data,
which contained social security numbers and other
sensitive information.
(cid:190) MCPA did not determine the nature of the crimes
committed by MCE inmates used to enter claims
data.
(cid:190) MCPA did not obtain documentation from the
data entry contractor that the required criminal
background checks had been conducted for its
personnel.

Other Issues
Maryland Medicaid Pharmacy Program
MCPA did not ensure that pharmacy reimbursements
($271 million during FY 2009) were reasonable.
(Finding 9) MCPA’s vendor was responsible for
processing and authorizing pharmacy claims using the
most current drug prices. MCPA did not verify the
vendor’s drug pricing with independent sources.
Long-Term Care Cost Settlements
MCPA did not maintain a comprehensive listing of all
long-term care facilities to track the receipt of cost
settlements and did not ensure that its contractor
completed all annual cost settlements. (Finding 10)
(cid:131) 246 settlements had not been issued within 1
year, as required.
(cid:131) 40 other settlements dating back to 2002 were
outstanding.
MCPA pays facilities during the year using interim
rates and identifies over and underpayments via the
settlement process. According to MCPA records, 403
settlements were completed in 2009 resulting in net
recoveries of $18.1 million.

Other Issues
(continued)
Kidney Disease Program
(cid:190) MCPA did not implement certain procedures and
controls to fully address deficiencies that enabled
certain fraudulent activities to occur in the Kidney
Disease Program over a ten-year period. In
February 2009, a KDP employee was convicted of
misappropriating $1.8 million by processing
fictitious KDP claims. (Finding 11)
(cid:190) Other procedural deficiencies over KDP
pharmaceutical claims resulted in overpayments
of at least $161,744 to one pharmacy and the
referral of this provider to the Office of Attorney
General – Criminal Division.
(cid:190) During FY 2009, KDP expended $12.5 million to
provide financial assistance to eligible end-stage
renal disease patients.

Other Issues
(continued)
Transportation Grant Program
(cid:190) Numerous deficiencies were noted with MCPA’s
oversight of the Program which provides grants to
local jurisdictions to provide Medicaid recipients with
non-emergency transportation to and from providers
rendering Medicaid-covered services. MCPA paid the
24 local jurisdictions $32.5 million during FY 2009
under the program. (Finding 12)
(cid:190) Local jurisdictions were not prohibited from hiring the
same vendor to both screen applicants for eligibility
and transport eligible applicants. This situation
existed in 11 jurisdictions that received $6.3 million
in FY 2009.
(cid:190) Vendors were not required to maintain sufficient
documentation to support the propriety of the
transport.
(cid:190) MCPA site visits to monitor the local jurisdictions
were not comprehensive or timely. One jurisdiction
that received about 30% of all grants in FY 2009 had
not been visited for over 4 years.

Conclusion
MCPA should:
(cid:190) Update the MOU with DHR and establish
comprehensive policies and procedures to
monitor the eligibility process and to correct
long-term deficiencies.
(cid:190) Improve procedures and controls over Medicaid
payments for recipients with Medicare
coverage, claims adjustments and sensitive
claims information.
(cid:190) Implement adequate procedures and controls
to address the other deficiencies noted in the
report including pharmacy drug costs, cost

Transportation Grant programs.
