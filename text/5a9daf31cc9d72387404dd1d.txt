Testimony to the House Appropriations Committee
Public Safety and Administration Subcommittee
february 28, 2018
Presented by Thomas J. Barnickel III, Joshua S. Adler, Adam M. Auerback
Chairman Haynes, Vice Chair Gutierrez, and subcommittee members, thank you for the
opportunity to present the results ofour review ofa $3.68 million payment made by the
Department ofInformation Technology (DolT) for services provided by contractors under an
October 2016 work order related to the eMaryland Marketplace (eMM), an internet-based
procurement system. The system is currently used by the State and other governments in
Maryland primarily to publish solicitations and contract awards for goods and services.
As requested by the Joint Audit Committee, the purpose ofthe review was to determine
whether the charges submitted by the contractors to support the payment were proper.
In response to a DolT request, a contractor under an existing statewide eGovernment
services master contract proposed to meet certain procurement-related goals and process
improvements, and provide day-to-day project management and oversight. Under the
arrangement, the statewide contractor would use the State’s existing eMM vendor as a
subcontractor since that vendor’s proprietary software was integral to the proposal.
The proposal provided for four primary services: (1) management and training; (2)
upgrade and launch ofa new version ofeMM; (3) strategic sourcing and supplier enablement;
and (4) procure-to-pay implementation. This latter service would result in the replacement ofthe
existing procurement component ofthe State’s financial Management Information System
(FMIS), which is overseen by the Comptroller ofMaryland and DolT.
The resulting work order was executed on October 14, 2016. Under the work order, the
State had no direct financial obligation to the statewide contractor and its subcontractor for their
costs associated with the work order because the contractor was authorized to charge a

convenience fee to vendors using eMM to sell goods and State agencies and other
services to
entities. There were no limits established or estimates made regarding the total compensation to
be received under the work order. The statewide contractor would retain all the convenience fees
up to $15 million from the vendors and remit 30 percent ofany fees above $15 million to DolT.
Based on the request ofthe Office ofthe Comptroller ofMaryland, DolT suspended the
work order on March 3, 2017. The compensation arrangement was one ofthe concerns
expressed by the Comptroller’s Office with the work order.
On July 26, 2017, the Board ofPublic Works approved the request ofDolT and the
Department ofGeneral Services to make a retroactive payment to the eMM vendor totaling
$3,682,404 for work performed under the work order. This payment consisted ofthree
components: (1) amounts to be paid to the statewide contractor ($500,512); (2) eMM
subscription and hosting fees ($783,761); and, the eMM vendor’s labor charges ($2,398,131).
The focus ofour work was to review the support for the costs under these three
components. To do this, we obtained a billing summary prepared by the vendor and other
evidence and explanations as to how the $3.68 million retroactive payment was calculated. The
billing summary primarily listed the individuals working on work order tasks, the hours charged
each day and then their cost based on rates set under the eGovernment master contract. In total,
the contractors reported 13,788 labor hours used under the work order.
We found that certain amounts billed could not be substantiated and, in some cases, raise
questions that would require additional follow-up by the State to resolve.
• The eMM vendor and the statewide contractor charged for labor occurring prior to
work order execution ($250,493) and after work order suspension ($522,071).
Whether these charges are appropriate is unclear, given that DolT was aware that
both contractors were performing work during those periods.
• The eMM vendor included indirect labor hours costing $243,016 even though the
rates used for direct labor hours already incorporated indirect costs.
• The subscription and hosting fees charged by the eMM vendor based on
information provided by DolT and the eMM vendor appear to be approximately
$109,000 higher than they should have been.

Based on the work we could perform, it appears the labor hours charged by the eMM
vendor (other than the indirect labor hours) was supported by the vendor’s timekeeping system.
The labor hours for the statewide contractor could not substantiated since those hours were
estimated.
Although there was evidence ofwork being performed by the statewide contractor and
the eMM vendor, we were unable to determine whether the 13,788 labor hours reported by the
contractors werejustified relative to work progress and expected outcomes. Neither the
statewide contractor’s nor the eMM vendor’s reported labor hours were categorized to determine
the hours spent for each ofthe four primary services, and a project plan was never approved by
DolT to help identify the level ofeffort expected for these services. According to DolT, no
deliverables for the four primary services were accepted and none ofthe work completed is
likely to have any substantive future benefit.
