Audit Overview
(cid:190) OPSB directs the development of State personnel
policies, administers the health care benefit programs
for State employees and retirees, and is responsible for
other personnel-related programs.
(cid:190) Health benefit payments have increased from $890
million to $993 million from FY 2005 to FY 2008.
(cid:190) The State directly pays claims for participants enrolled
in health care plans administered by PPO’s, certain
services rendered by point of service (POS) providers,
prescription drug and mental health plans. These plans
are self-funded; the State accepts the risk for all
medical costs.
(cid:190) For all other POS services and services provided by
HMO’s, the State is fully insured and pays a premium
(such as a capitation fee) for medical costs.
(cid:190) The report included 14 findings, 5 of which were
repeated from the preceding audit report.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) OPSB did not adequately administer the contract with
its former pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). Certain
discounts and rebates were not received by the State.
(cid:190) OPSB had not determined whether its former PBM,
which had engaged in “drug switching” activities for
other insurance plans, had conducted such activities
under the State’s prescription drug plan.
(cid:190) OPSB had not pursued recovery of potentially
fraudulent health care claim payments totaling
$534,000, nor resolved certain claim payments with
various administrators totaling $3.7 million that it had
identified as potentially ineligible.
(cid:190) OPSB did not receive timely certain final reports
prepared by a private firm hired by OPSB to audit the
State’s health plan benefit administrators.
(cid:190) Certain IT controls were not sufficient.

Oversight of Prescription Drug Program
OPSB did not ensure it received all contractual drug
discounts from its former PBM. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) OPSB’s audit firm issued a draft audit report indicated
that for Plan Years (PY) 05 and 06, the State received
smaller discounts than required. (e.g., in PY 05,
46.7% of the average wholesale price instead of
56%).
(cid:131) Resultant overpayments were not calculated or
quantified in the report. After OLA brought this matter
to OPSB’s attention, the firm initially advised OPSB
that the State made overpayments totaling as much
as $10.1 million.
(cid:131) Subsequent to our report issuance, the firm issued its
final report and reduced the calculated overpayment
amount to $2.9 million. OPSB advised OLA that it
would seek recovery of that reduced amount.
(cid:131) A similar finding was included in our prior report.

Oversight of Prescription Drug Program
(cont’d)
OPSB’s former PBM did not provide the State with
required drug manufacturer rebates of approximately
$700,000 for PY 06. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) The contract audit report for PY’s 05 and 06
concluded that the State received all rebates.
However, a PY 06 contract modification that provided
a guaranteed minimum rebate for each prescription
filled was not identified.
(cid:131) OLA’s review of the contract audit report found that
for PY 06 the State received rebates totaling $6.6
million; however, an additional $700,000
representing the guaranteed minimum rebate was
due from the prior PBM.
(cid:131) OPSB and its contract audit firm agreed with the OLA
analysis and in September 2008, OPSB billed the
prior PBM $700,000, which had not yet been
collected as of December 1, 2008.

Oversight of Prescription Drug Program
(cont’d)
OPSB had not taken action to determine whether its
former PBM had engaged in drug switching activities
with respect to Maryland’s prescription drug plan.
(Finding 3)
(cid:131) AG’s from Maryland and other states reached a legal
settlement with the former PBM for allegedly
engaging in such activities with respect to other
insurance plans (i.e., the State’s prescription drug
plan was excluded from the scope of the inter-
jurisdictional review).
(cid:131) The PBM was required to pay $38.5 million to the
participating jurisdictions (including $2.4 million to
Maryland).
(cid:131) It was alleged that drug switching increased patient
co-pays and prescription claim costs to health benefit
plans by encouraging physicians to change patients’
prescriptions.

Monitoring of Claim Payments
OPSB did not adequately pursue recovery for 21 claims
paid totaling $534,000 related to apparent fraudulent
medical claims submitted by four State employees.
(Finding 6)
• OPSB’s third party administrator (TPA) acknowledged
that its claims processing system failed to flag these
claims (relating to periods of travel outside of the
USA from 1/00 through 12/05) for investigation prior
to payment, as required.
• A firm hired by the TPA conducted on-site visits to the
facilities where the services were claimed to have
been provided; however, the facilities could not
provide any verifiable medical records to support any
of the claims.
• Health care benefits were terminated for the
employees, but recovery was not pursued from the
TPA until OLA brought this matter to OPSB’s attention.
OPSB had not verified that the TPA corrected the
related claim processing problems.

Monitoring of Claimant Eligibility
OPSB did not adequately follow up and resolve certain
claim payments identified as potentially ineligible.
(Finding 7)
(cid:131) During its automated post claim review process,
OPSB identified $146 million in potentially ineligible
claim payments during PYs 05 through 08.
• OPSB reviewed $46.3 million of these claims,
without concluding as to the eligibility of $3.7
million (8%).
• From those claims (i.e., 8%), OLA reviewed
claims totaling $883,000 and found 47 paid
claims totaling $131,000 for ineligible
participants.
(cid:131) No reviews were conducted for the remaining $100
million.
(cid:131) Similar conditions have been commented on in
reports dating back to 1997.

Audits of Health Plan Administrators
(cid:190) OPSB did not receive timely, complete audit reports
related to the health benefit plan administrators.
(Finding 8) For example,
(cid:131) As of June 30, 2008, OPSB had not received final
audit reports (that were due by 1/31/08) for any of
the State’s 13 health benefit plans applicable to
the PYs ended June 30, 2005 and 2006.
(cid:131) Draft audit reports contained various errors and
omissions. For example, the auditor had not
calculated, and did not disclose, significant
overpayments made by OPSB’s pharmacy benefits
manager, as identified in Finding 1.
(cid:190) OPSB did not adequately monitor the qualifications of
personnel assigned to the audits. On several
occasions the auditor replaced, without OPSB’s
approval, certain personnel (including the Audit
Manager) with lesser-qualified personnel. (Finding 9)

IT Security Issues /Cash Receipts Controls
(cid:190)Controls over key OPSB information systems were not
sufficient to protect sensitive employee and systems’
information.
(cid:131) For the Benefits Administration System - used to
support health care benefits provided to over
110,000 employees, retirees, etc. – certain actions
were not taken to monitor security events, such as
failed access attempts. (Finding 10)
(cid:131) Certain personnel data and user authentication
information were transmitted in an unencrypted
format, and operating system passwords and
account controls for the PTA server did not meet the
minimum State requirements. (Finding 11).
(cid:190)Cash receipts, which totaled $50.8 million in FY 08,
were not adequately controlled. For example, certain
duties were not separated and deposits were not
independently verified. (Finding 13)

(cid:190) Improve PBM contract monitoring to ensure that all
required discounts and rebates are obtained timely.
