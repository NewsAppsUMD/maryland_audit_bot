Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021
1) Comptroller of Maryland (COM) – Compliance Division (12/18/20 – 15 pages – 5 findings,
including 3 repeats)
The Compliance Division’s primary responsibilities include enforcement of all tax laws
administered by COM. A number of the audit findings are closely related to this mission.
 The Division did not consistently perform three of its available tax compliance programs
designed to identify and pursue certain individuals who failed to file required income tax
returns or report all income. As a result, the Division lacked assurance that individuals
specifically targeted by the programs, such as those who filed extensions, but had not yet
filed the related tax returns, eventually complied with the filing requirements and paid any
resulting tax liabilities.
 The Division’s business tax collection unit did not ensure that tax assessments were
prepared and recorded in the Comptroller of Maryland’s automated State of Maryland Tax
(SMART) system on a timely basis when businesses failed to file business tax returns, such
as for sales and use taxes and withholding taxes.
 The Division did not adequately control critical adjustments to taxpayer accounts in SMART.
Critical adjustments, which were processed primarily by four units, include, for example,
financial adjustments that affect taxpayer liabilities, such as abatements resulting from
taxpayer appeals, changes due to settlements, and adjustments necessary as a result of
error corrections.
 The Division did not assess penalties, as required by law, when holders of unclaimed
property, such as financial institutions and insurance companies, failed to remit such
property to the Division. If unclaimed property is not remitted by the holder when required, a
financial penalty equal to 15 percent of the property value is to be imposed on the holder.

2) Maryland Department of Health (MDH) – Regulatory Services (1/19/21 – 25 pages – 7
findings, including 5 repeats)
Regulatory Services is a separate budgetary unit within MDH which consists of 22 Health
Professional Boards and Commissions (HPBCs) and the Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ).
We believe that certain of our findings could be the result of insufficient individual board
resources. Although this may be an area for further study, we noted opportunities for
consolidating licensing, procurement, and other fiscal functions of the HPBCs. This course of
action is not required by any statute or regulation; however, we believe that consolidating these
processes would allow the HPBCs to resolve certain longstanding internal control deficiencies.
 Our review of complaint tracking procedures for 2 of the 22 HPBCs, the Board of Nursing
and the Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists, disclosed that neither Board
provided sufficient oversight to ensure that complaints against licensees were investigated
timely. Our audit disclosed a significant number of complaints received by these Boards
that were still under investigation more than one year after the complaints were received.
 The Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) did not inspect each of the assisted living
facilities and developmental disabilities service providers annually as required by State law.
Specifically, OHCQ did not complete all of the required annual inspections during fiscal
years 2016 through 2019.
 Controls over collections and deposits received at the HPBCs were not adequate, and
duties related to cash receipts and licensing were not properly segregated. Our review of
procedures and controls disclosed deficiencies at 19 of the 22 HPBCs. For example, 14
HPBCs lacked procedures to verify that all credit card collections processed by third-party
vendors were deposited into the State’s bank account. In addition, 9 employees with
access to collections received at 7 HPBCs has been assigned system user functions that
allowed them the capability to issue or renew licenses, certificates, or permits, or adjust the
related billing records.
 Twenty-one HPBCs did not perform documented system access reviews of their licensing
system to ensure that user access capabilities were adequately restricted. As a result,
numerous users could unilaterally issue or renew licenses, and current or former employees
had unnecessary system access.

3) Department of Natural Resources (DNR) (4/5/21 – 22 pages – 7 findings, including 1
repeat)
DNR oversees the management and use of the State’s living and natural resources for the
current and future enjoyment of Maryland’s citizens and visitors. Among other issues raised by
the audit, our review disclosed three audit findings related to two conservation programs.
 DNR overpaid for land conservation easements because it did not always identify and
correct mistakes or inconsistencies in the easement valuation calculations made by the
sponsors on DNR’s Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program easement valuation
worksheets. For example, based on our calculations, DNR overpaid approximately
$450,000 on a $1.4 million easement because the sponsor used the incorrect rate and
incorrectly applied the valuation formula. DNR is responsible for reviewing the sponsor-
prepared calculations before purchasing the easements, which are ultimately subject to
approval by the Board of Public Works. In addition, DNR did not ensure sponsors
performed annual site visits in accordance with the easement agreements.
 DNR did not obtain required documentation needed to effectively monitor the State Forest
Conservation Act (FCA) program. In addition, DNR did not use $3.5 million collected for
reforestation projects within the time required. DNR has oversight responsibilities for the
State FCA program, including the approval of required plans and the monitoring and
inspection of projects on State-owned land.
 DNR did not have an effective process to monitor local FCA programs to ensure local
jurisdictions were operating within State law. In addition, DNR did not effectively monitor
and account for local forest conservation funds.
