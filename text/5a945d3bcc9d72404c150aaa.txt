Dear Senator Kasemeyer and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office ofLegislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by the Department
of Juvenile Services (DJS) to resolve the four repeat findings in our May 15, 2014 audit report.
This review was conducted in accordance with a requirement specified in the April 2017 Joint
Chairmen‘s Report (JCR), page 174. The JCR required that, prior to the release of$50,000 ofits
administrative appropriation for fiscal year 201$, DJS must take corrective action on all repeat
audit findings on or before November 1, 2017. The ICR language further provided that OLA
submit a report to the budget committees listing each repeat audit finding along with a
determination that each finding was corrected. The OLA report is required to be submitted to
allow 45 days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior to the end ofthe
fiscal year.
The May 15, 2014 audit report ofDJS contained four repeat audit findings (findings 1, 4,
7, and 12) that were addressedby five recommendations. This is the secondyearthat arequirement
regarding repeat audit findings in this audit report has been included in the ICR for DJS. In
response to the requirement in the April 2015 JCR, we notified the budget committees on May 9,
2016 that DJS had resolved the two recommendations related to findings 1 and 4, andthat the three
recommendationsrelatingto findings 7 and 12 remainedunresolved. In addition, we haverecently
issued our subsequent audit report on DJS, dated November 1, 2017, in which we reviewed the
status ofall repeat findings from the May 15, 2014 audit report.
In accordance with the April 2017 iCR requirement, DJS provided a report to OLA, dated
October 26, 2017, detailing the corrective actions it had taken with respect to the repeat audit
findings. We reviewed this report and considered the results of our recently completed audit of
DJS to assess the implementation status of the related recommendations. Our review did not
constitute an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards.

Delegate Maggie McIntosh, Chair
Exhibit 1 is DJS’s October 26, 2017 status report, which indicated that corrective actions
had been completed to address the recommendations for three findings and that corrective actions
were ongoing for the remaining finding. Our review determined that DJS had not taken sufficient
actions to correct finding 7, while findings 1, 4, and 12 were resolved.
A summary of OLA’s assessment of the status of each of the repeat audit findings is
included in the attached Exhibit 2. Exhibit 3 contains OLA’s assessment regarding the repeat
finding that had not been resolved, which is primarily based on our recent audit report and is
consistent with DJS’ October 26, 2017 status report.
We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the ICR requirement. Please contact me if
you need additional information.
Sincerely,

OLA’s Assessments Regarding Repeat Findings That Were Not Resolved
Prior Report Recommendation finding 7
—
We recommend that
a. DJS restrict restitution system access to ensure that employees with the capability to
establish or adjust case data do not also have the capability to post and initiate
payments on the system (repeat), and
b. an independent employee conduct reconciliations ofDJS’ restitution records with
corresponding records maintained by the bank and by the State Comptroller (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
In our November 1, 2017 audit report, we noted that DJS had not adequately restricted restitution
system access. Specifically, one headquarters employee had full, unrestricted access to the
Restitution Tracking System (RTS) and was primarily responsible for recording changes to
restitution orders entered into RTS and processing restitution payments. This employee also had
the capability to record new restitution orders and none ofthese transactions were subject to
independent supervisory review.
We also noted that DJS had not reconciled its records ofunmatched collections on RTS with the
corresponding balance on the State Comptroller’s records since January 1997. The unmatched
collections balance represents lockbox payments that could not be readily identified to a specific
restitution account. As ofDecember 31, 2015, the fund balance ofunmatched collections on the
Comptroller’s records (approximately $162,400) exceeded the balance on RTS (approximately
$91,500) by $70,900. According to RTS, the balance ofthe unmatched collections comprises
1,012 payments dating back to December 7, 1993. As a result, the accuracy ofRTS account
balances is questionable, and DJS cannot know for certain ifeach account is active, delinquent,
or has already been paid and should have been closed.
In its status report, DJS stated that it would continue ongoing efforts to address the deficiencies
in the restitution process.
