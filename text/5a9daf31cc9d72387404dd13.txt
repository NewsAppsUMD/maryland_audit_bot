Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017
1) State Board of Elections (SBE) (4/24/17 – 18 pages – 8 Findings)
 SBE did not ensure the accuracy of the data recorded in the Statewide voter registration system
(MDVOTERS) or whether related user access to the system was appropriate. Specifically, SBE
did not verify that local boards of election (LBEs) properly investigated individuals appearing on
monthly reports of possible ineligible voters and took appropriate corrective action. For
example, a January 2016 report included 5,871 voters registered in Maryland who may be
deceased. In addition, SBE did not verify that LBEs reviewed their employees’ user access nor
did SBE conduct any reviews of the propriety of user access granted to MDVOTERS. Our
review of user access records found numerous users that had potentially unnecessary user
access, including 619 usernames that had no login activity in the last six months.
 SBE did not ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) from the MDVOTERS database
provided to a third party entity was properly safeguarded. The data included the name, date of
birth, driver’s license number, and last four digits of the social security number for each
registered voter in Maryland, which under State law is defined as PII. Our review disclosed that
SBE did not require independent reviews be performed of the third party entity or the entity’s
contractor to ensure the Maryland voter data provided to these parties was secure. PII was also
unnecessarily retained by SBE within its MDVOTERS database, consisting of names and full
social security numbers for over 592,000 voters as of August 2016.
 SBE did not adequately authenticate certain voters who requested absentee ballots during the
primary and general elections.
 The Electronic Pollbook Interchange and Conversion (EPIC) system was not backed up offsite
and was not properly addressed in the SBE Disaster Recovery Plan. EPIC is a critical voting
system used to identify citizens who have voted in a particular election (including early voting)
and is also used for the same-day voter registration process during early voting.
 Certain internal control and recordkeeping deficiencies were noted related to the procurement of
contracts and the monitoring of certain payments. For example, for two contracts tested,
awarded as single sources and valued at $18.8 million, SBE could not support the awards were
in the State’s best interest.

Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017
2) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Regulatory Services (4/26/17 – 24 pages – 8
Findings)
Regulatory Services consists of the following entities: Health Professional Boards and Commissions
(comprising 17 individual boards and 2 commissions), the Board of Nursing, the Board of
Physicians, and the Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ). These entities are responsible for
licensing and regulating health professionals (such as physicians, nurses, and pharmacists) and
health care facilities in the State.
 The Board of Professional Counselors and Therapists did not properly track and monitor
complaints received against licensees, resulting in complaints not being investigated and
submitted to the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) for administrative and/or criminal action in
a timely manner. We noted untimely action for 9 of the 15 complaints we tested, including 3
complaints that had not been submitted to OAG even though the Board recommended that
these complaints should have been referred to OAG for administrative action (including license
revocation) at least ten months earlier. As of November 2016, 136 complaints were still under
investigation or not yet investigated, including 91 that had been open for more than one year.
 The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC) improperly procured consulting and
license application evaluation services for medical cannabis growers, processors, and
dispensaries through interagency agreements with a State university. The structure and use of
the interagency agreements resulted in a circumvention of competitive procurement and control
agency approvals, as well as a lack of assurance that these services were obtained at the most
advantageous cost to the State. For example, MMCC significantly understated the number of
applications to be evaluated, resulting in an increase in the value of the agreements from
$545,000 to $2.4 million, and relied on the university to renegotiate prices with the hired
evaluators without ensuring the cost increases were reasonable.
 The Board of Nursing did not always take timely action to suspend the licenses of delinquent
noncustodial parents referred by the Child Support Administration as required by State law. In
addition, as noted during prior audits, OHCQ had not performed annual inspections for a
number of licensed assisted living facilities and facilities for the developmentally disabled as
required by State law.
 Certain boards and commissions had not established adequate controls over cash receipts. For
example, 17 of the boards and commissions did not ensure that employees who handled
collections were denied the capability to issue or renew licenses in the electronic licensing
systems.
 Certain controls over the information systems used by three boards were not sufficient to protect
critical licensee data.
