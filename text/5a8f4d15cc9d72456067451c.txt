AGENCY HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership
consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
The Commission has the following responsibilities:
1. Adopting the rules and regulations for the recreational and commercial taking or catching
of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams from the Potomac River;
2. Issuing licenses for the taking or catching of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams and for
boats, vessels, and related equipment;
3. Imposing an inspection tax on oysters caught in the Potomac River; and
4. Reseeding and replanting oyster bars.
The Commission’s regulations carry the full force and effect of law, and the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission jointly enforce the regulations.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the following
sources:
2010 2009
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $175,000
Maryland appropriations 175,000 175,000
Federal grant 79,495 98,061
Sport fishing licenses 109,615 100,382
Commercial fishing licenses 76,185 80,310
Commercial crab licenses 72,870 74,925
Commercial oyster licenses 3,945 5,375
Commercial clam licenses - -
Oyster bushel tax 401 525
Interest and miscellaneous 15,808 5,523
Total revenue $682,069 $715,101
The Commission saw a slight decrease in total revenue for fiscal year 2010, as a result of small
decreases in the sale of licenses and grant funding from the Atlantic Coast Fisheries Cooperative Management
Act grant. The Commission performed less work related to their federal grant in fiscal year 2010, and as
such, received less funding from the grant. In addition, as part of budget reductions in fiscal year 2010, the
Commission returned $26,250 of the original $175,000 appropriation to the Commonwealth of Virginia in
September 2009.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:
2010 2009
Personnel services $363,228 $362,213
Federal grant 74,730 92,301
Contractual services 86,901 75,521
Development and repletion 8,774 10,623
Materials and supplies 46,192 46,261
Insurance 6,629 6,509
Fixed assets 5,846 1,324
Operating Expenses 592,300 594,752
Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Oyster development 100,000 40,000
Retiree health care 50,000 25,000
Reserve Expenses 150,000 65,000
Total Expenses $742,300 $659,752
Operating expenses decreased by $2,452 from fiscal year 2009. An increase in contractual service
expense offset a decrease in federal grant expense. Other expense categories remained relatively unchanged.
In addition, the Commission continues to retain funds in order to support future oyster work in the Potomac
River and support retiree health care costs. They are attempting to determine the best way to develop a self-
sustaining oyster industry in the Potomac, and they intend to use reserve funds to support this cause.
During fiscal year 2010, the Commission set aside an additional $100,000 to fund future oyster work
and $50,000 to fund retiree health insurance. The chart below shows the continued growth of the reserve
funds for use in future fiscal years:
Beginning Ending
Additions
Balance Balance
Oyster Reserves $ 40,000 $100,000 $140,000
Retiree Health Care Reserves 25,000 50,000 75,000
Total Reserve Balance $ 65,000 $150,000 $215,000
The Commission closed fiscal year 2010 with an operating gain of $89,769. After factoring in the
reserve expense of $150,000, the Commission had an overall loss of $60,231.
The Commission was able to retain more cash this year than in the prior year as they performed no
major projects in fiscal year 2010. The Commission closed fiscal year 2010 with a cash balance of $281,550,
including $155,161 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts and a separate Virginia investment
pool account for retiree health care reserves, with a balance of $75,591 as of June 30, 2010.

The Honorable Robert F. McDonnell
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Charles J. Colgan
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission
for the year ended June 30, 2010. We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our
audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions in the
Commission’s accounting system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls, and test compliance
with applicable laws and regulations.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal control
and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and
efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual, sufficient to
plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of our audit
procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of transactions,
and account balances.
Capital assets Cash receipting
Contractual services expenses License revenues
Payroll expenses Federal grant revenues and expenses
Appropriations

We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had been placed
in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with provisions of applicable
laws and regulations. Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents,
records, and contracts, and observation of the Commission’s operations. We tested transactions and performed
analytical procedures, including budgetary and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded and reported
in the Commission’s accounting system. The Commission records its financial transactions on the cash basis of
accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The financial information presented in this report came directly from the
Commission’s accounting system.
We noted no matters involving internal control and its operation that we consider necessary to be reported
to management. The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations disclosed no instances
of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on June 6, 2011.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly, management,
and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the state of Maryland and is a public record.
