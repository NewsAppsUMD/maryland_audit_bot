Audit Duplication Avoided
(cid:190) When warranted, we use the work of other
auditors to avoid duplication of effort.
(cid:190) Usually we are able to do this for significant parts
of the Revenue and Billing Cycle, and Federal
Funds.
(cid:190) At legislative hearings each January, the LEAs
have acknowledged that our audits provide
unique coverage and have not duplicated any
preceding audits.

Other General Comments
(cid:190) Existence of compensating and detective
controls is always considered when evaluating
internal control.
(cid:190) Generally LEAs have seriously considered the
audit recommendations for both their own audit
and the audits of other LEAs.
(cid:190) The audit reports do identify best practices and
noteworthy accomplishments of the LEAs.
(cid:190) LEA management and staff have been very
cooperative.

General Issues
Spanning several audit areas is a broad issue re:
polices and procedures.
• Have comprehensive Board policies and a
corresponding Administrative/Accounting
procedures manual been put in place?
• Is the procedures manual current and
consistent with the Board policies?

they appear to use:

(cid:131)ESMEC – Eastern Shore of Maryland Energy Consortium
MSDE Involvement / Coordination – May be
