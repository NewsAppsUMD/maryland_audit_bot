Overview of Repeat Audit Findings
 OLA issues about 50 fiscal compliance audit reports each year containing
about 150 recommendations.
 Virtually all recommendations are accepted by agencies, although there have
been a few recent disagreements.
 As of June 2006, 40% of findings were repeated in the first subsequent audit
report.
 As of June 2021, 29% of findings were repeated in the first subsequent audit
report, indicating significant improvement since 2006. Since 2013, the
overall repeat percentage had been relatively stable, although in the past 4
years, the number of repeat findings appears to be rising each year (See
Exhibit).
 As of June 2021, 8% of findings were repeated after the second subsequent
audit, which represents no change from the previous year.

Follow-up Processes for Repeat Audit Findings
 State Government Article, §2-1224(h) requires agencies with 5 or more
repeat audit findings to provide
• an initial status report to OLA on corrective actions taken on all findings
within 9 months of the related audit reports and, thereafter,
• quarterly status reports until satisfactory progress has been made on all
findings, or until the next audit begins.
 Budget bill language and committee narrative (Joint Chairmen’s Report),
instituted annually since the 2013 Session, has restricted the appropriations
for agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings until
• corrective action has been taken by the agencies for the repeat findings,
and
• OLA submits reports on its determination regarding the actions taken.

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process
Historical Perspective:
 From 2006 to October 2010, 38 audit reports (involving 28 agencies) had 5
or more repeat findings, requiring these agencies to submit quarterly status
reports, which are subject to OLA desk review.
 From October 2010 through December 2016, 4 audit reports had 5 or more
repeat findings and the status report process has concluded. These 4 audit
reports collectively contained 44 report findings (including 23 repeats). The
next audit for each found that 35 of the 44 prior findings were resolved (only
1 of the original 23 repeats was not corrected).
 During calendar years 2017 and 2018, 4 audit reports had 5 or more repeat
findings and have also been subject to the more comprehensive JCR follow-
up process and/or the OLA follow-up review process for agencies with
unsatisfactory ratings. These 4 audit reports collectively contained 50 report
findings (including 26 repeats). The next audit for each found that 37 of the
50 prior findings were resolved (only 4 of the original 26 repeats were not
corrected).

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process (cont.)
 During calendar year 2019, 2 audit reports had 5 or more repeat findings and
have also been subject to the OLA follow-up review process for agencies with
unsatisfactory ratings or the more comprehensive JCR follow-up process.
Subsequent audits are in progress for both agencies.
 During calendar year 2020, no audit reports issued had 5 or more repeat
findings.
 During calendar year 2021, 3 audit reports (MDH – Regulatory Services, DHS
– Social Services Administration (SSA), and Higher Education Commission)
had 5 or more repeat findings and one of these reports (SSA) will also be
subject to an OLA follow-up review process for agencies with unsatisfactory
ratings. All 3 reports are subject to the quarterly status report process.

JCR Follow-up Process - Background
 Beginning with the April 2013 Joint Chairmen’s Report, in response to JAC
concerns, the Chairmen of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and
the House Appropriations Committee instituted a process to restrict funding
for agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings, until the submission of a
report by OLA on the status of related corrective actions.
 The annual amount of funds restricted for each agency generally is
$100,000, but has recently ranged from $50,000 to $250,000.
 The determination of whether to release funding is at the sole discretion of
the budget committees.

JCR Follow-up Process – Recent Results
 The April 2019 Joint Chairmen’s Report (JCR) did not contain any budget
language restrictions related to OLA audit findings.
 The April 2020 JCR contained budget bill language restrictions for 2 agencies
with 4 or more repeat audit findings.
• Based on OLA’s review, the 2 agencies collectively had taken sufficient
actions to resolve over half of the findings, with the remaining findings still
in progress.
• The restricted funds were fully released for both agencies.
 The April 2021 Joint Chairmen’s Report (JCR) did not contain any budget
language restrictions related to OLA audit findings.
 In addition to the above, there were budget language restrictions in April
2020 and April 2021 for cybersecurity-related findings (see slides on pages 8
and 9).

JCR Follow-up – PII Audit Findings
 In addition to the 2 agencies previously identified, the April 2020 JCR
contained budget language restrictions for 3 agencies (see chart on page 10)
that had repeat findings on the failure to safeguard personally identifiable
information (PII) in their audit reports issued in 2019.
 The restricted funds were released for these agencies after OLA reviewed
the State Chief Information Security Officer (SCISO) status report and
determined that each agency either resolved the findings or demonstrated
a commitment to correct the findings.

JCR Follow-up – Cybersecurity Audit Findings
 The April 2021 JCR also contained budget language restrictions for 3 agencies
(see page 10) that had repeat cybersecurity audit findings in their audit reports
issued in 2020. These agencies each have $100,000 in general fund
appropriation for administration withheld until:
• they meet with the SCISO to identify and document a path to resolve the
findings;
• SCISO submits a report to OLA by February 1, 2022 addressing corrective
actions taken to remediate cybersecurity audit findings, a path and timeline
for resolving any outstanding issues, and any ongoing costs associated with
corrective actions; and
• OLA reviews the actions identified and determines that they demonstrate
the agencies’ commitment to correct each repeat. OLA shall report its
results to the budget committees and JAEC by May 1, 2022.
 The Baltimore County Local School System must also complete the items
above.

Conclusion
 We believe that the various follow-up processes provide useful tools to
compel State agencies to generally take meaningful corrective action to
implement audit recommendations, although the Committee may desire to
initiate discussion on possible enhancements.
 Since 2006, the overall percentage of repeat audit findings has decreased
from 40% to 29% in 2021. However, while the percentage of repeat findings
had remained virtually unchanged for several years, starting in 2018 a
worrisome upward trend has been noticed whereby the number and
percentage of repeat findings have again started to increase. OLA will
continue to monitor this trend and report to the Committee.
