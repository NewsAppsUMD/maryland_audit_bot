Background and Scope of Review
The Department of State Police Aviation Command’s (hereinafter referred to as
the Aviation Command) primary mission is to provide emergency medical
transportation (medevac) with helicopters located in seven bases throughout
Maryland. The helicopters are also used for aerial law enforcement, search and
rescue, homeland security, and disaster assessment services. All requests for
medevac or other services are made to a central dispatch facility known as the
System Communications Center (SYSCOM). Upon receipt of a call for a
helicopter, SYSCOM personnel record the request in a computer-aided dispatch
system and contact the appropriate helicopter base to dispatch the aircraft.
Information from this system is the source for the Aviation Command’s reported
mission data, which was the subject of the OLA’s review.
According to the Department of Legislative Services, since fiscal year 2003, the
Aviation Command has received approximately 80 percent of its funding from the
Maryland Emergency Medical System Operations Fund (MEMSOF) and 20
percent funding from the General Fund based on the ratio of medically-oriented
missions to nonmedically-oriented missions. MEMSOF is primarily funded by a
surcharge levied on owners of motor vehicles registered in the State.
The scope of our work consisted of obtaining mission data extracts for fiscal years
2006 to 2013 from the computer-aided dispatch system maintained by SYSCOM,
which is the underlying basis for the Aviation Command mission data annually
reported in the Managing for Results (MFR) section of the State’s budget books.
We assessed the reliability of the data by comparing it to independent records,
such as aircraft logs maintained by pilots. In accordance with the committees’
request, we also reviewed SYSCOM and the Aviation Command procedures for
accumulating and reporting helicopter mission data to assess if those procedures
provided reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the reported data. The scope
of our review was less than that of an audit conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards.

Results of Review
Our review of the Department of State Police Aviation Command’s mission data
and collection methodology disclosed the following:
Mission Data
OLA’s tabulation of the Aviation Command helicopter mission data for fiscal
years 2006 to 2013 is shown on Exhibit 1 in accordance with the eight mission
types identified in the committees’ request. We also separately included
cancelled missions – when a helicopter was requested, but was cancelled before
take-off. (According to the Aviation Command, mission cancellations were
included in its reported mission data, such as medically-oriented and law
enforcement activities.) Together, data for the eight mission types and the
cancellations represent the Aviation Command’s total mission activity.
Collection Methodology
Our review of the collection methodology used to record and report helicopter
mission data disclosed that the Aviation Command needs to address the following
four issues to improve its effectiveness in providing accurate mission information:
 The Aviation Command had not developed comprehensive definitions for the
mission data (such as Air Medical Activities) reported in the Managing for
Results (MFR) section of its annual budget submission (see Exhibit 2). The
Department of Budget and Management’s MFR Guidebook requires agencies
to develop definitions for the measures reported in the budget documents.
Although, via footnote, the Aviation Command had identified certain
activities included as Air Medical, the list was not all inclusive. For example,
we were advised that the Aviation Command included all cancelled medical
missions and deemed all support missions to be medically-oriented for
reporting purposes. Thus, the reader may not have a clear understanding of
how the Aviation Command determined the number of medically-oriented
missions it reported, including how cancelled missions are counted.
 The Aviation Command lacked written procedures to document and ensure
consistency in how MFR data is retrieved and reported. Furthermore, there
was no documented supervisory review of the mission data reported in the
MFR sections of the budget documents.
 The Aviation Command did not maintain a historical record showing how the
reported mission data was compiled and was unable to recreate the reported
information from the existing data. We noted certain differences between the
mission data reported annually by the Aviation Command and those we
present in Exhibit 1. For example, total actual missions (including mission
5

cancellations) reported for fiscal year 2013 (5,737) differed with OLA’s total
(6,097) by 360.
 There were no documented quality assurance reviews over the recordation of
nonmedically-oriented missions (such as law enforcement missions) recorded
in the computer-aided dispatch system. In comparison, the Maryland Institute
for Emergency Medical Services Systems (MIEMSS) annually reconciles
medical missions recorded in the SYSCOM dispatch system to a separate
MIEMSS system that is used to document patient care.
We shared these results with the Department of State Police, which generally
concurred with OLA’s tabulation. The Department advised that it intends to take
appropriate action to address the four bullet points above and thus improve its
mission collection and reporting methodologies.
