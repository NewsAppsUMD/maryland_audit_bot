Introduction and Scope
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires each county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in
Maryland to file annual (or once every four years under specified conditions)
audit reports. There were 191 local government audit reports due for fiscal year
2014 (24 counties, 153 cities and towns, and 14 taxing districts). The reports are
to include financial statements, with accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports
that express opinions as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented.
The financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. We have prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide
additional information regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing
requirements.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-307 of the Code requires the Office of
Legislative Audits to perform a desk review of each local government’s annual
audit report for compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and
auditing standards. Section 16-308 of the Article specifies the reporting and
review requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by the counties.
The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is required to
review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2014 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as one fiscal year 2013 report (Town of Pittsville) and two fiscal year 2012
reports (Town of Deer Park and City of Hyattsville). The desk reviews were
performed to accomplish the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and certain
accounting and auditing standards pertaining to the presentation of the
financial statements and auditors’ reports.
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits, timely filing of audit reports).
 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances or unfavorable trends and ratios, based on analyses of financial
4

data over the most recent five-year period (July 1, 2009 through June 30,
2014).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2014 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.

Audit Reports
Certain audit reports were not filed or were not filed on time.
As of July 31, 2015, five local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal
years 2013 and 2014, and one other local government had not filed its audit report
for fiscal year 2014. Furthermore, 18 local governments submitted audit reports
after the required filing date. The failure of a local government to file an audit
report, or a delay in filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its
citizens. The submission of audit reports after the required filing date was also
noted for 5 of these 18 local governments during our preceding year’s review.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland generally requires audit reports to be filed on or before October 31 after
the close of the fiscal year or on or before December 31 after the close of the
fiscal year for those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2014 had not
been received, as of July 31, 2015, for the following five governments:
1. Town of Deer Park
2. City of Glenarden
3. City of Hyattsville
4. Town of Marydel
5. Town of Morningside
Subsequently, the City of Glenarden submitted its audit report for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2013. The failure of the four other local governments to submit
audit reports has been reported to the Executive Director of the Department of
Legislative Services. If these reports are not filed, the State Comptroller, acting
upon the advice of the Executive Director, is authorized by law to discontinue the
payment of all funds, grants, or State aid to which the local governments are
entitled.
Additionally, an audit report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 had not been
received, as of July 31, 2015, for the City of Baltimore.
We will review all fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014 audit reports and take any
follow-up action necessary when the reports are received. The results of these
reviews will be included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2015 local
government audit reports.

The towns of Brookview, Church Creek, Eagle Harbor, Eldorado, Galestown,
Goldsboro, Henderson, Hillsboro, Mardela Springs, Queen Anne and
Templeville, and the Ellerslie and Mount Savage special taxing areas had
previously requested and were granted waivers from filing audit reports. These
local governments met the conditions for filing an audit report every fourth year
as provided for under the Local Government Article, Section 16-305 of the Code
and, depending on the waiver period, will be required to file its next audit report
for either fiscal year 2015, fiscal year 2016, or fiscal year 2017.
The auditor’s report for one local government contained an adverse opinion
on one opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit, and two
other local government reports contained qualified opinions on certain
opinion units.
The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion on one
opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit and two other local
government reports contained qualified opinions on certain opinion units. The
following is a summary of these opinions.
The auditor’s report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion (a
statement that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles) on the discretely presented component
unit opinion unit because of the omission of financial data for the Town’s
component unit. Specifically, financial data related to a development corporation
that is a component unit of the Town had not been audited and was not included
in the Town’s financial statement.
The Town’s audit report also contained a qualified opinion (a statement that,
except for the effects of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial
statements are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles) on the governmental activities opinion unit because the Town had not
measured the effect of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
49 entitled “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation
Obligations.” According to the report, certain buildings of the development
corporation contained asbestos and, although deemed improbable, the Town could
become liable for the cost of abatement.
As a result, the Town’s financial statements were not presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required by State law. The
Town’s audit reports for each fiscal year since 2009 also contained an adverse
opinion and a qualified opinion due to these situations.

The audit reports for the Town of Pittsville for fiscal years 2014 and 2013
contained qualified opinions on all of the Town’s opinion units (governmental
activities, business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining
fund information) because, during the years ended June 30, 2014 and June 30,
2013, the accounting records had been altered to cover up unauthorized
disbursements from the Town. A third party was engaged to reconstruct the
books and records and it was discovered that the Town did not have records to
support the classification of revenue and numerous expenditures did not have
authorization. The Town’s systems also did not provide certain outstanding
balances as of June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013. Consequently, the auditor was
unable to determine what adjustments were necessary.
The fiscal year 2012 audit report for the Town of Deer Park contained a qualified
opinion on the Town’s governmental activities, each major fund, and the
aggregate remaining fund information opinion units because the personal property
tax revenue had not been audited due to the fact that the Town could not provide
proper documentation on billing and revenues received.
Although required by our audit guidelines, the auditors for the Towns of Pittsville
and Deer Park did not submit separate letters to the Office of Legislative Audits
explaining the reasons for the qualified opinions, and the Towns’ plans to rectify
the problems to enable the auditors to express unqualified opinions in the future.
The auditor for the Town of Sykesville submitted a letter explaining the qualified
opinion as required.
Auditors’ reports for 11 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for 11 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The auditor’s report for
one of these local governmental units included deficiencies that were also cited
during our preceding year’s review. The following is a summary of these
deficiencies:

or on all financial statements.

--- Page 11 ---
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires that audits be performed in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. These standards require, in part, that the auditor express an
opinion(s) as to whether the basic financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the respective financial position, the respective changes in
financial position, and cash flows, where applicable, of the local government in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Financial Statements
Financial statements submitted by 31 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 31 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of four of these local governments included two such deficiencies and
the financial statements of two of these local governments included three such
deficiencies. Furthermore, the financial statements of 2 of these 31 local
governments included one or more deficiencies that were also cited during our
preceding year’s review. The following is a summary of the deficiencies and the
corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances

Financial statements and accompanying notes for one local government did
not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
The financial statements and accompanying notes for one local government did
not include certain disclosures regarding its long-term debt as required by
generally accepted accounting principles. Adequate disclosure is necessary to
facilitate the understanding of, and to provide for fair presentation of, the financial
information.
Noncompliance with State Law
Financial statements of 14 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required
by State law.
Financial statements of 14 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law (Exhibit A). The Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland requires that deposits with financial institutions by
local governmental units be fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes
the risk of loss of deposits in the event the financial institution defaults. In
addition, this law requires that collateral be of the types specified in the State
Finance and Procurement Article, Section 6-202 of the Code.
Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.
An unrestricted general fund deficit balance was noted for one local
government as of June 30, 2014.
An unrestricted general fund deficit balance was noted for one local government
as of June 30, 2014 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of
the current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem.

Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local
governments as of June 30, 2014.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local governments as
of June 30, 2014 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local governments had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Article,
Section 16-306 of the Code. Section 16-308 of this Article requires that certain
types of special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the
county in which the districts are located not later than 90 days after the close of
the fiscal year, in accordance with the rules and regulations established by the
applicable county. The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each
district’s compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting
copies of these reports to the Office of Legislative Audits.
The required reports have not been filed for two special taxing districts as of
July 31, 2015.
As of July 31, 2015, we had not received the required reports for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2014 for two special taxing districts which are located in Anne
Arundel County. Anne Arundel County advised us that they were in the process
of pursuing compliance with applicable filing requirements for these districts and
that appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding
funds).
