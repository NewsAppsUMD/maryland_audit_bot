Significant Audit Findings
July 1, 2009 to November 30, 2009
1) Department of Human Resources (DHR) – Local Department Operations (LDO) (8/4/09 –
28 pages – 13 findings)
LDO is a separate budgetary unit consisting of the funds appropriated for the operating costs
of the State’s 24 local departments of social services (LDSS), as well as for the various
assistance activities (such as food stamps and temporary cash assistance) they administer.
• Audits of the LDSSs conducted by DHR’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) were
not performed in accordance with auditing standards, and did not fully address
significant risks. In addition, these audits were not performed every two years, as
required by State law. Due to audit quality concerns, OLA conducted audits of selected
activities at three large LDSSs.
• At one of the LDSSs audited, adequate controls had not been established to ensure
that foster care and adoption payments were proper. During fiscal year 2008, the
LDSS’s foster care and adoption expenditures totaled approximately $188 million. Also,
there were no procedures to ensure that Federal Title IV-E initial eligibility
determinations had been performed for all children placed into foster care, and eligibility
redeterminations were not performed timely.
• Medical Assistance (Medicaid) eligibility determinations made at one LDSS for long
term care recipients were not always proper and documented. In addition, an available
online tool was not used to identify undisclosed assets.
• Controls over bank account disbursements and collections were deficient at certain
LDSSs. For example, at one local department, the employee who prepared the bank
reconciliations had access to blank checks and to the check signing machine.
• Control deficiencies were also noted over purchases and disbursements. For example,
numerous employees at two LDSSs could process disbursements on the State’s
accounting system without independent approvals. In addition, payments made by one
LDSS totaling $1.3 million to one vendor were not subject to control agency approvals
and lacked documentation to substantiate the propriety of the amounts billed.

2) Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) (8/27/09 – 34 pages – 16 findings)
• Certain aspects of MSDE’s loaned educator program appeared to be in conflict with
State law and regulations. During FY 2009, MSDE employed 66 loaned educators from
17 local school systems at a cost of $8.5 million. The loaned educators filled positions
in one of six different categories, including 15 educators who served as professional
assistants, in executive management and director positions, for periods ranging up to
14 years. The extent and total costs of the program were not specifically disclosed to
the General Assembly’s budget committees.
• Inspections of child care facilities were not conducted as required. Timely monitoring of
the local department of social services was not performed to ensure the propriety of
eligibility determinations and related payments of the State’s Child Care Subsidy
Program, which totaled $99 million during fiscal year 2008. Also, procedures had not
been established to verify certain child care provider billing information.
• MSDE recorded unsubstantiated federal fund revenues totaling approximately $13.3
million at June 30, 2008 related to expenditures incurred in fiscal years 2002 and 2003.
• Adequate monitoring procedures were not employed as related to a prior contract to
manage State family support centers. Furthermore, a new $15.9 million management
agreement included limited oversight requirements.
• Certain aspects of the Maryland Business Enterprise Program for the Blind did not
appear to be in accordance with State laws and regulations. Also, there was no
assurance that blind individuals benefited as intended.
• Security and controls over key MSDE information technology (IT) operations need
enhancement. MSDE did not have a comprehensive IT disaster recovery plan and
proper monitoring of security related events was not performed.
• Procurement and related payment practices were not always consistent with State
regulations.

3) Managing for Results – Performance Measures – Education – Maryland State
Department of Education (Performance) (10/2/09 – 17 pages)
We conducted a performance audit to determine the accuracy of 6 of the 12 measures
contained within the Education portion of the Managing for Results (MFR) - State
Comprehensive Plan as reported in the Maryland fiscal year 2009 operating budget request.
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) was responsible for reporting these
results. We also determined whether adequate control systems were in place for collecting,
summarizing, and reporting the performance measure data. The audit concluded the
following:
• For the 6 measures tested, 2 were Certified, 2 were considered Certified with
Qualification, and 2 were designated as Factors Prevented Certification.
• For the 2 measures that could not be certified, MSDE was not adequately ensuring
that supporting data used to calculate the measures were complete and accurate.
• Although MSDE had certain quality control processes in place, the processes should
be strengthened by establishing procedures to ensure that all relevant data are
included in the measure calculation and that the data, including data from third
parties, are reasonably accurate.
As requested by the chairmen of the legislative budget committees, OLA is in the process of
systematically auditing the results of the 62 MFR measures contained in the State
Comprehensive Plan, which was produced by the Department of Budget and Management.
This audit is the second to be conducted; the first audit consisted of the 13 measures of the
Public Safety and Safer Neighborhoods portion of the Plan.

4) Board of Trustees of the Maryland Teachers and State Employees Supplemental
Retirement Plans – Investment Contract Pool (Special) (10/9/09 – 32 pages – 10
findings)
We conducted a review of an allegation received through our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline
regarding the possible lack of disclosure of losses incurred in the Maryland Investment
Contract Pool (ICP), which is one of several investment options of the Maryland
Supplemental Retirement Plan (MSRP). The ICP’s objective is to preserve principal and
provide a stable, competitive return for participants. The reported book value of the ICP
portfolio was approximately $729 million as of December 31, 2008.
• MSRP did not adequately disclose unrealized ICP investment losses in financial
publications made available to existing or prospective plan participants, nor were the
unrealized losses disclosed in MSRP’s 2007 audited financial statements. As of
December 31, 2008, these unrealized losses totaled approximately $48 million.
• MSRP did not independently verify the reported market value of ICP investments, and
did not independently verify the accuracy of the interest rates calculated by the
investment manager that were used to credit earnings to participant accounts.
• MSRP management personnel were consistently unable to satisfactorily address
fundamental questions, including a clear and accurate explanation of the wrapper
agreements. These agreements are obtained to provide protection of portfolio principal
under certain circumstances. MSRP could not provide us with relevant documents
relating to the ICP.
• MSRP management and the MSRP Board did not adequately document their
monitoring of the performance of the investment manager and the sub-managers.
Performance reports prepared by MSRP’s investment consultant indicated the ICP was
outperformed by comparable investment plans for the 3-year and 5-year periods ending
December 31, 2008.

5) Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF) (11/4/09 – 13 pages – 5 findings)
• In June and December of 2008, MAIF’s Board of Trustees approved changes to certain
critical requirements of MAIF’s calendar year 2008 employee bonus program. We
question the timing and appropriateness of these changes, without which the majority of
that year’s approximately $1.4 million in bonuses would not have been paid.
• MAIF made certain expenditures for consulting, marketing, and lobbying services, as
well as certain outreach costs, that may not be consistent with MAIF’s primary mission
as a State-created insurer of last resort. Due to their nature, we believe certain
expenditures should be subject to disclosure to the legislature’s budget committees to
ensure that such expenditures are consistent with the legislature’s intended mission for
MAIF.
• Certain procurement transactions were not consistent with MAIF’s established
procurement procedures and documentation of expenditures could be improved.
• Payments made to private attorneys were not always reported in accordance with
regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.

6) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Developmental Disabilities Administration
(DDA) (11/20/09 – 28 pages – 14 findings)
• DDA lost the opportunity to obtain federal funds totaling approximately $3 million
because claims identified during our preceding audit were not corrected and
resubmitted within required federal timeframes.
• DDA did not adequately investigate federal fund reimbursement claims that were
rejected due to Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) edits, and federal
funds totaling $433,000 were not recovered due to a MMIS edit that was not applicable
to DDA claims.
• DDA did not have adequate processes to ensure that certain provider claims for prepaid
services were submitted to MMIS for processing or that federal fund reimbursement
requests were timely. As a result, federal funds and interest income totaling $139,500
and $421,000, respectively, were not obtained or had been lost.
• Adequate documentation was not maintained to support waiting list information reported
to the General Assembly’s budget committees in January 2009, and periodic reviews of
individuals on the waiting list were not performed during most of our audit period.
• DDA’s report to the General Assembly regarding client prioritization did not adequately
disclose that clients completing the Transitioning Youth Program were receiving full
DDA services, and bypassing individuals on the waiting list, regardless of those
individuals’ severity of need or waiting time.
• DDA did not monitor client resource coordinators and, as a result, 72 clients lost
Federal Medicaid eligibility.
• Effective procedures were not in place to detect providers that billed for services for
deceased individuals. Our testing disclosed that DDA made payments to 7 providers
totaling $235,000 for 8 individuals who were deceased when services were reportedly
provided.
• DDA had not taken timely action to recover unspent Wage Disparity Initiative funds
totaling $3.6 million from providers that did not use the funds to increase the
compensation for providers’ direct service workers, as intended.
• DDA had not established proper security access controls over critical data maintained
on its information system.

7) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) – Processing of Certain Medicaid
Claims (Performance) (11/23/09 – 42 pages – 16 Findings)
We conducted a performance audit of certain aspects of DHMH’s Medicaid claims processing
and federal reimbursement procedures, for which related claims payments totaled $2.68
billion during fiscal year 2009.
• There were valid reasons for not using most MMIS edits that were disabled, but 9 of the
51 edits we tested should not have been disabled. These 9 edits applied to claims
totaling in excess of $98 million during the nine-month period ended March 31, 2008.
Had these edits been used, the claims would have been suspended and subject to
further review before being paid.
• Controls over changes to edit settings were inadequate. Four employees could
deactivate edits without any approvals. A record of setting changes and written
justifications as to why edit settings were changed were not maintained.
• Detailed written descriptions of the various automated edits were often brief and vague.
• Certain claims were improperly processed for payment due to a temporary change in
edit settings. MCPA determined that claims totaling $1.4 million were paid in error.
• Excessive MMIS system access capabilities were inadvertently granted to allow 532
users to pay claims that were suspended due to edits.
• Although certain claim processing functions had backlogs, no formal studies of staffing
requirements had been performed to determine if its existing resources should be
reallocated. MCPA does not have a training program for employees performing critical
claims processing functions.
• DHMH’s post payment review process was not formally structured or adequately
documented. There were no specific requirements as to the type and frequency of
computer analyses of claims data to identify potentially improper paid claims.
• The vendor MCPA hired to audit in-state paid hospital claims did not complete audits
timely.
• There was no systematic process among DDA, MHA, and MCPA to determine the
causes for rejected federal reimbursement claims so that procedures and processes
could be modified to minimize future rejected claims. Also, rejected claims were not
investigated and resolved promptly.
