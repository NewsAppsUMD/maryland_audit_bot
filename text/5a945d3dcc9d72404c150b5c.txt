Dear Senator Kasemeyer and Delegate Conway:
In the April 2010 Joint Chairmen’s Report (page 123), the committees directed the Office of
Legislative Audits (OLA) to review Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE)
assessment contracts and related documents. The narrative further requested that a report on our
review be submitted to the budget committees by December 1, 2010.
MSDE contracts with several firms to provide various testing services for the Maryland School
Assessments (MSA) and the Maryland High School Assessments (HSA). The MSA tests
reading, mathematics, and science achievement. The reading and mathematics tests are
administered annually to students in grades three through eight; the science test is administered
annually in grades five and eight. The HSA tests achievement in algebra/data analysis, biology,
English, and government, and are based on Maryland's high school Core Learning Goals. These
assessment contracts and related expenditures each span several testing and fiscal years.
According to the Analysis of the Fiscal Year 2011 Maryland Executive Budget prepared by the
Department of Legislative Services – Office of Policy Analysis (OPA), MSDE often encumbered
millions of dollars in general funds at the end of the fiscal year to cover certain expected
assessment contract expenses in the coming year. In the budget for fiscal year 2008, the General
Assembly made a reduction to align MSDE appropriations with expenditures for assessments.
Further, in the 2009 session, budget bill language directed MSDE to submit, along with copies of
executed assessment contracts, a cash flow schedule for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011
indicating the amounts owed for assessment contracts each year. We understand that OPA was
unable to reconcile the MSDE cash flow schedule with assessment contract amounts budgeted
for fiscal years 2010 and 2011.

The specific request made of OLA in the April 2010 Joint Chairmen’s Report, required that
OLA review assessment contracts and related documents and identify the amount owed, by
month, for each contract currently in effect as relates to the Division of Accountability and
Assessments Program (R00A01.04). Given the nature of the contracts and the related payment
process, coupled with the contract lengths spanning a number of future years, we consulted
extensively with OPA staff about the scope of our review, and with that clarification, we focused
our review on MSDE’s projected cash flows for fiscal year 2011.
To facilitate our review, MSDE provided us with its projected 2011 monthly cash flow schedule,
as of August 17, 2010, for assessment contracts budgeted in the Division of Accountability and
Assessments (Program R00A01.04). According to MSDE’s schedule, there were five contracts
with three vendors to provide various testing services for the MSA and HSA, with expected cash
flow (contract payments) of $40,677,004 during fiscal year 2011, including $1,470,865 related to
an estimate for contracts that had not yet been procured (see Exhibit A attached). With the
exception of these estimated costs, we reconciled the MSDE-prepared cash flow schedule to
related vendor fee schedules associated with each assessment contract or subsequent addenda.
Because of the nature of the request, and subsequent OPA clarification, we did not do the
following:
 verify assessment contract costs that were charged to other budgetary programs or
amounts related to contracts that had not been procured as of August 17, 2010,
 compare expected cash flows to amounts appropriated or to remaining contract balances,
and
 verify the propriety of any possible future deficiency requests or encumbrances to be
made by MSDE related to these assessment contracts.
The scope of our review was less than that of an audit conducted in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards.
I trust this information is in response to your request and will prove useful in future MSDE
budget deliberations.
Sincerely,
Bruce A. Myers, CPA
Legislative Auditor
