Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018
1) Maryland Department of Health (MDH) – Prevention and Health Promotion
Administration, et al. (PHPA) (4/4/18 – 19 pages – 7 Findings, including 2 Repeats)
The audit identified certain issues related primarily to three programs administered by PHPA:
the Maryland AIDS Drug Assistance Program (MADAP), the Maryland AIDS Drug Assistance
Program — Plus (MADAP-Plus), and the Breast and Cervical Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment
Program (BCCDTP). MADAP (including MADAP-Plus) and BCCDTP had fiscal year 2016
expenditures totaling approximately $46.3 million and $13.2 million, respectively.
 PHPA did not ensure that all rebates from approximately 170 prescription drug
manufacturers for drugs dispensed to clients under MADAP were received and were
accurate. As of March 2017, PHPA had not recognized that one of ten manufacturers we
selected for review had not paid rebates for a six-month period ended June 2016.
Subsequently, this manufacturer remitted the $49,300 rebate to PHPA. Furthermore, we
estimated that PHPA was underpaid by as much as $2 million for 20 drugs dispensed to
MADAP clients for one quarter in 2016. According to PHPA records, drug rebates received
during fiscal year 2016 totaled approximately $52.4 million.
 PHPA did not have adequate procedures and controls over applicant eligibility for MADAP
and BCCDTP. For example, for the majority of our audit period, PHPA did not use an
available independent source to help verify applicant income, which is considered when
determining an applicant’s eligibility for either Program.
 PHPA did not adequately restrict user access to critical information on individuals eligible for
MADAP and MADAP-Plus that also was used by pharmacies to check the MADAP eligibility
of individuals requesting medications as well as to initiate payment for the related claims.
PHPA also did not adequately review system overrides of rejected MADAP pharmacy
claims and MADAP-Plus insurance premium payments that were manually processed and
entered into the MADAP system, to ensure that only valid payments were made.
 PHPA did not have adequate processes to ensure the propriety of certain manually
processed MADAP pharmacy claims, and did not recover pharmacy claim overpayments
totaling $425,000 that were identified during vendor-performed pharmacy audits.
 Numerous PHPA employees had unnecessary access to PHPA’s Patient Reporting
Investigation and Surveillance Manager (PRISM) system. We identified 46 users who had
either not accessed PRISM since its creation or within 6 months of our test. PRISM
includes information on all patients diagnosed with Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and
includes personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI).
 PHPA did not conduct timely inspections of food-processing facilities to ensure the facilities
were complying with applicable food safety laws and regulations.

Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018
2) Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) (5/14/18 – 21 pages – 7 Findings,
including 2 Repeats)
 MDE used interagency agreements with a college to augment its staff, rather than using a
competitive procurement process for required services or using budgeted positions. For
example, at various times between June 2014 and October 2017, one MDE unit obtained
and directed the services of 40 college employees through interagency agreements for
which expenditures totaled approximately $3.1 million during the period between July 2013
and February 2018, including an estimated $996,000 in administrative fees.
 MDE lacked an adequate process to ensure that independent inspections had been
performed, when required, of affected properties under its Lead Poisoning Prevention
Program. Although MDE implemented a process during fiscal year 2014 in an effort to
ensure, on a test basis, that required properties were registered and had a valid inspection
certificate; the process was generally ineffective. We identified 10,832 registered rental
units without inspection certificates on file, which MDE had not investigated.
 MDE had not performed inspections of certain construction sites for compliance with
approved erosion and sediment control plans as required by State regulations, and MDE's
determinations of any monetary penalties resulting from inspections that were performed
were not always documented or approved.
 There were a number of deficiencies with MDE’s security and control over its information
systems and network.
o We identified 11 contractors working for IT vendors, who were provided remote access
to the MDE network to perform various IT project support activities. However, this
access was not properly restricted to the network resources related to their respective
responsibilities. These 11 contractors had improper network-level access to the entire
MDE internal network, including access to servers holding various applications’
information, employee workstations, and other network resources.
o Malware protection was not sufficient to provide MDE with adequate assurance that its
computers were properly protected. For example, 1,152 MDE computers were found to
not be operating a current malware protection software version, and we identified over
1,000 workstations that had not been updated with the latest releases for two software
products that are known to have significant security-related vulnerabilities.
o A critical database and numerous servers were running on software versions that had
been out-of-date for many years.

Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018
3) Maryland Department of Transportation – Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)
(11/20/18 – 29 pages – 11 Findings, including 4 Repeats)
 MTA did not adhere to State procurement regulations in a number of areas and
circumvented State procurement regulations for certain procurements that required
competitive bidding.
o Based on referrals through our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline, we identified instances
where MTA used existing contracts to obtain unrelated services. For example, $319,000
was paid for an individual to perform accounting-related services under two existing
architectural and engineering contracts. These payments included administrative fees
paid to the subcontractors that procured the services at MTA's direction. Additional
contract procurement and monitoring deficiencies and certain questionable activities
were identified as a result of other hotline referrals (a separate report on the results of
our special review of these allegations was issued on January 7, 2019).
o MTA used interagency agreements with institutions of higher education to circumvent
State procurement regulations that require competitive bidding. MTA directed two
institutions to enter into agreements with a private vendor to provide services that were
outside the scope of the agreements. Related expenditures, which dated back to 2012,
totaled $1.8 million and included $529,000 in administrative fees paid to the institutions.
Associated task orders were not sufficiently detailed to allow MTA to ensure the required
work was performed. MTA also did not pursue recovery of approximately $725,000 in
questionable payments made under one agreement identified by its Office of Audits.
o MTA lacked sufficient evidence to support certain sole source procurements, required
bid documentation was not maintained for two large procurements, and MTA repeatedly
procured services from two vendors using the corporate purchasing card without
soliciting competitive bids.
o MTA paid $6.1 million to a vendor to clean its light rail vehicles without ensuring the
required work was performed.
 Examples of findings in other functional areas included:
o Malware protection for MTA's computers was not sufficient to provide adequate
assurance that the computers were properly protected.
o Adequate controls had not been established over payroll and pension processes for
union employees.
o Controls over the Mobility Paratransit Program were not sufficient to ensure that only
eligible individuals received benefits, and internal control deficiencies were identified
relating to cash receipts and equipment.
