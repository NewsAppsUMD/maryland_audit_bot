Background
 SHA is responsible for the planning,
construction, improvement, maintenance, and
operations of the State highway system and
operates numerous facilities throughout the
State, including its headquarters in Baltimore
City and seven district offices responsible for
State roads in their respective districts.
 SHA entered into multi-year contracts with
architectural and engineering firms to provide
construction inspection services for SHA
construction projects.
 SHA’s Office of Construction (OOC) was
responsible for developing the scope of these
contracts on behalf of the district offices, and
the Office of Procurement and Contracts (OPC)
conducted the related procurements (including
issuing the requests for proposals and
publishing the solicitations).

Background
 Separate contracts are issued for each of the
seven district offices, which in turn are
responsible for assigning work to the firms
under contract in their respective districts, for
monitoring the related work, and for
approving the invoices.
 As of December 31, 2010, among the seven
districts, there were 17 open construction
inspection contracts.
 Total contract cost - $146 million
 Remaining unspent balance - $64 million.
 Contracts span several years so certain
district offices had multiple contracts open at
the same time.

Audit Overview
 OLA received a hotline allegation regarding
possible conflicts of interest involving several
senior SHA employees responsible for certain
construction-related services. We reviewed the
allegations and the procurement of two $16 million
inspection service contracts in one SHA district.
 OLA’s review of these allegations identified
possible violations of State Ethics Laws,
Governor’s Executive Order, and SHA policies, as
well as questionable procurement practices and
the improper use of contract funds. Certain
matters were referred to the Criminal Division of
the Office of Attorney General* and the State
Ethics Commission.
 OLA performed a second special review of certain
aspects of the construction inspection services
contracts that disclosed additional deficiencies.
* A referral to the Criminal Division does not mean that a criminal act has actually
occurred or that criminal charges will be filed. A decision related to a violation of
State Ethics Laws would be determined by the State Ethics Commission.

June 24, 2011 Special Report Findings
Original Hotline Allegation:
Possible conflict of interest between certain
SHA management employees and architectural
and engineering firms.
Key Findings:
 A senior SHA management employee in SHA’s
OOC appeared to have solicited funds from
firms doing, or seeking to do, business with
SHA potentially violating State Ethics Laws, a
Governor’s Executive Order, and SHA policies.
The employee’s business interest was not
always disclosed on the annual Financial
Disclosure Statements filed with the State
Ethics Commission.(Finding 1)

June 24, 2011 Special R e port Findings
(cont.)
 A former senior SHA management employee
started working for a firm doing construction
management and inspection services for SHA
within 12 days of retiring from SHA in
December 2008. The employee was directly
involved in SHA’s procurement of the firm’s
contract and subsequently was directly
involved in this contract as an executive of
the firm, in possible violation of State Ethics
Laws and SHA policies. (Finding 2)
 SHA employees upon leaving State service
were routinely hired by firms doing business
with SHA, but no attempts were made to
identify these employees and/or to ensure
that their employment was not violating State
Ethics Laws and SHA policies.(Finding 3)

June 24, 2011 Special Report Findings
(cont.)
Our review of the procurement and related
payments for two $16 million contracts involving
the aforementioned employees and firms
disclosed:
 A complete rating of the technical
proposals was not performed and certain
key components of the rating process were
not adequately documented (Finding 4)
 The independent contract award approval
process was compromised (Finding 4)
 SHA, in conjunction with the firms,
redirected contract funds from the two
aforementioned contracts for unrelated
projects, and/or to conceal overspending
on other contracts, thereby circumventing
Board of Public Works (BPW) oversight and
approval. (Finding 5)

November 21, 2011 Special Report Findings
OLA performed an expanded review of
construction inspection services contracts
processed by the OOC due to concerns identified
in Finding 5 of our June 2011 Special Report.
We reviewed invoices totaling $70 million from
16 contracts involving 12 firms for the period
from 1/1/08 to 4/4/11.
Key Findings:
 SHA and 10 architectural and engineering
firms arranged to use unexpended balances
of contracts, totaling $11.3 million, to pay for
work that was outside the scope of those
contracts without obtaining required BPW
approval. These arrangements are indicative
of a less than arm’s-length relationship that,
in turn, could raise questions regarding the
integrity of the procurement and payment
process for subsequent contracts involving
these firms. (Finding 1)

November 21, 2011 Special Report Findings (cont.)
 SHA did not issue written task orders to
formally assign work and to manage these
contracts awarded to the firms. As a result,
SHA could not effectively monitor services
provided by firms, as well as the related
charges billed by the firms. (Finding 2)
 During the period from September 2008
through August 2009, SHA improperly
extended the contract expiration dates for all
9 contracts reviewed that had expired,
allowing SHA to retain approximately $26
million in unspent contract funds. SHA
extended the related contract periods for
certain of these contracts a total of 19 times—
resulting in extensions of each for two or more
additional years—without BPW approval.
(Finding 3)

November 21, 2011 Special Report Findings
(cont.)
 OLA’s test of four contract awards totaling
$34 million and approved by the BPW,
disclosed that:
 SHA could not adequately support the
amount of funds that had been requested,
and
 Available supporting documents did not
provide a consistent, discernible basis for
estimating construction inspection
contract values. The percentage of
construction inspection service contract
values to related construction costs
ranged from 3% to 27% based on original
estimates and ranged from 5% to 11%
based on subsequent support. (Finding 4)

November 21, 2011 Special Report Findings
(cont.)
 SHA procured new contracts even though
unspent funds remained on existing contracts.
(Finding 5) For example, in November 2009
SHA requested and received BPW approval for a
new $10 million contract when there was $36.5
million in contract funds remaining in other
contracts for similar services in this district.
Furthermore, as previously noted in Finding 3,
during this same period, SHA was entering into
agreements with firms to extend the contract
terms to retain unspent funds.

Conclusion
SHA should:
 Establish procedures to ensure that, in the future,
employees comply with State Ethics Laws,
Governor’s Executive Order, and SHA policies
 Ensure that contracts are procured in accordance
with SHA procurement policies and that the
process (including the justification for contract
values) is adequately documented.
 Develop procedures and controls to ensure that
contract funds are only used as authorized.
 Obtain BPW approval for significant contract
modifications, and submit past modifications to
BPW for retroactive approval.
 Issue task orders for all construction inspection
services and use the task orders to monitor the
work and related invoices.
