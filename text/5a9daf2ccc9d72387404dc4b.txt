Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013
1) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Health Regulatory Commissions (HRC) (1/7/13 –
23 pages – 5 Findings)
HRC comprises three independent commissions established by law: the Maryland Health Care
Commission (MHCC), the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC), and the Maryland
Community Health Resources Commission (MCHRC).
• Control deficiencies were noted that result in a lack of assurance that the billings processed by
the 53 hospitals regulated by HSCRC, with combined annual revenues totaling more than $13
billion, were in accordance with HSCRC’s established rates.
 HSCRC did not have a process to periodically review hospital billing systems to determine if
hospitals had implemented adequate controls over the maintenance, updates, and
management of the systems to ensure that hospital bills were proper.
 HSCRC did not fully investigate the impact of hospital billing overcharges identified through
annual agreed-upon procedures reviews that it requires be performed. OLA’s review of the
FY 2009 agreed-upon procedures reviews disclosed that four hospitals charged rates
ranging from 67 to 1,880 percent higher than allowed by HSCRC for certain medical
procedures. OLA estimated that related past overcharges at those hospitals (dating back to
2001 or 2004) totaled at least $13.2 million, of which at least $3.7 million was overcharged
to the State’s Medicaid program.
 HSCRC did not periodically review documentation to support the reasonableness of the
billing rates established directly by the hospitals. HSCRC estimated that revenue from the
related medical procedures accounts for approximately 10 to 20 percent of total hospital
revenue.
 The calculations used by HSCRC to determine the annual hospital rate order agreements
were not independently reviewed by supervisory personnel.
• The MHCC did not require its contractor, which processes claims from the Maryland Trauma
Physician Services Fund, to confirm that trauma patients on reimbursement claims were listed
on the Maryland Trauma Registry, as required by the contract and State law. The MHCC
administers this Fund to reimburse trauma physicians for services rendered to uncompensated
care patients. OLA’s match of the contractor’s claims records to the Registry disclosed 1,357
approved claims, totaling $290,000, for which the patient trauma registry numbers on claims did
not exist in the Registry.

Significant Audit Findings
December 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013
2) Department of Assessments and Taxation – Homestead Property Tax Credits (Performance)
(2/28/13 – 33 Pages – 7 Findings)
OLA conducted a performance audit to assess the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation’s (DAT) procedures for ensuring that Homestead Property Tax Credits (HTC) are only
granted for eligible properties. The audit was conducted at the Joint Audit Committee’s direction.
OLA evaluated DAT’s procedures and controls for initially approving HTCs and for periodically
reviewing properties’ continuing eligibility for HTCs. OLA estimated that HTCs would reduce
property tax revenues for FY 2013 by $325 million.
• DAT had not developed a documented comprehensive compliance program establishing the
responsibilities and related processes to be performed by headquarters and the 24 local
assessment offices to help ensure that HTCs are only granted for eligible properties.
• HTC application processing procedures should be improved by routinely comparing owner
names on HTC applications with names on real property records, by ensuring that certain
approved HTC applications are independently reviewed, and by processing the backlog of
applications (totaling 175,000 as of January 17, 2013) as soon as possible.
• Certain system access to automated real property records and HTC applications was not
adequately restricted (e.g., 371 employees had the capability to change HTC information) and
edits to critical data fields in both systems were not subject to independent supervisory review.
• DAT did not develop a policy regarding the recovery of all improperly granted HTCs.
• DAT did not have a plan to evaluate the propriety of past HTCs on property subsequently
removed from eligibility because a current application was not submitted or approved. This
could be an indicator of past improperly granted HTCs. As of January 17, 2013 there were
512,283 properties deemed eligible for the HTC, but may not have submitted an application (as
noted previously, there was a significant application processing backlog) and will lose HTC
eligibility unless an application is submitted by the deadline (currently December 31, 2013).
OLA identified automated methods and data sources DAT could use to systematically evaluate
properties for continued HTC eligibility.
• Five matches were identified by OLA that, if used, would enhance DAT’s ability to identify
properties that are no longer HTC eligible. Data sources identified included certain Motor
Vehicle Administration records and State Income Tax records.

3) Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City (Performance) (3/28/13 – 66
pages – 24 Findings)
OLA conducted a performance audit to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
management practices of the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City (BLLC) as
required by State law, focusing on licensing, inspections, disciplinary procedures, and
management oversight. As of December 2011, BLLC had issued 1,360 alcoholic beverage and
adult entertainment licenses.
Licensing of Entities to Sell Alcoholic Beverages
• BLLC lacked formal written policies to guide the licensing process.
• BLLC frequently issued licenses without receiving all required documentation from licensees or
applicants and OLA tests of the BLLC licensing process disclosed that BLLC lacked
documentation that certain State law and BLLC licensing requirements were met.
• BLLC could not account for all fees for licenses issued and did not always assess late fees.
Inspections of Licensees
• BLLC lacked comprehensive written policies and procedures over the inspection process.
• BLLC lacked an automated method to monitor inspections performed, inspection outcomes,
and related enforcement and disciplinary actions taken.
• BLLC did not assess its workload requirements for inspections and related staffing needs.
There was a lack of evidence that supervisors regularly monitored inspectors and reviewed the
inspection results.
Disciplinary Process for Violations
• BLLC used non-approved alternatives to the Board hearing process for violations and
infractions and lacked written policies and procedures for the disciplinary process.
Management Oversight
• BLLC had not implemented management processes to effectively oversee and determine the
efficiency and effectiveness of its operations.
• Financial disclosure forms were not filed as required and BLLC did not document formal
evaluations of employee performance on a routine basis.

4) Military Department (5/30/13 – 20 pages – 9 Findings)
• The Department recorded Federal fund revenues of $701,318 at the end of FY 2012 to cover
expenditures incurred even though the federal grantor agency previously denied requests for
these funds. If the Department is unable to recover these federal grant funds, general fund
appropriations or deficiency appropriations may be needed to eliminate the resulting deficit.
Also, the Department did not recover indirect costs for its work associated with Maryland
Emergency Management Agency grants for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, as required.
• State law established the Senator William H. Amoss Fire, Rescue, and Ambulance Fund to
increase the financial support for the related fire, rescue, and ambulance companies in local
governments. The Department is responsible for disbursing and monitoring the use of the
funds by all 24 local jurisdictions, which were awarded grants from the Fund totaling $10 million
annually during FY 2010 - 2012.
• The Department did not withhold funding from the 11 jurisdictions that did not meet certain
minimum expenditure levels during FY 2011, as required by State law. Based on OLA
calculations these jurisdictions should have been penalized $585,000 for failing to meet
funding requirements.
• The Department did not establish progressive actions to be taken when fire departments did
not use or maintain Amoss grant funds in accordance with State law and Department policy.
The Department did not take certain actions when it found that funds were used for
ineligible expenditures, were not maintained in separate bank accounts, and were invested
in unsecured stock brokerage accounts.
• The Department did not obtain and review detailed disbursement information from the Maryland
State Firemen’s Association to ensure that annual grants to the Association were spent as
intended.
• Questionable corporate purchasing card purchases made by one employee totaling $107,493
remained undetected for up to three years because certain available purchasing data was not
reviewed. Subsequently, the employee was terminated and pleaded guilty in federal court.
• Internal control and record keeping deficiencies were noted with respect to cash receipts,
equipment, and State vehicles.
