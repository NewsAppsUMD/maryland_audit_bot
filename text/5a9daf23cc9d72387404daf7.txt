Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Child Support Enforcement Administration
(CSEA) operates a statewide child support program
that includes:
(cid:131) Establishment of paternity and child support orders
(cid:131) Collection of support payments
(cid:131) Distribution of funds collected
(cid:190) Local child support offices, other state and local
government agencies, and private contractors
perform child support services.
(cid:190) Collections during FY 2007 totaled $496 million, an
increase of $43 million from FY 2004.
(cid:190) Unpaid support obligations increased by $110
million over the 3-year period ended 9/07 to $1.57
billion.
(cid:190) The audit covered the period from March 10, 2004
to August 31, 2007 and included 15 findings.
Although 9 findings were repeats, CSEA’s audit
accountability and compliance level has improved
since last audit.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Certain available enforcement procedures (e.g.,
occupational license suspension) were not used
or were not used effectively to maximize and
further enhance collection efforts.
(cid:190) A process was not in place to identify payments
being issued to deceased custodial parties. Our
match to DHMH death records found payments in
excess of $300,000 made to deceased
individuals.
(cid:190) $1.1 million in undisbursed funds were not
forwarded to the State Comptroller as required by
State law.
(cid:190) CSEA did not analyze the proper distribution of
$2.4 million transferred from a local office bank
account to its central bank account.
(cid:190) CSEA did not adequately monitor several
contracts to ensure all deliverables were received
or that all billed costs were proper.

Certain Enforcement Tools Were Not Used
(cid:190) Suspension of occupational licenses was not used
as an enforcement tool. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) Upon CSEA’s request, State law requires 14
State licensing authorities, such as the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, to
suspend occupational licenses of delinquent
obligors.
(cid:131) OLA computer matches identified 5,283
individuals with occupational licenses who
owed delinquent child support totaling $47
million.
(cid:131) 11 of 20 licensed individuals tested had not
made any recent payments and had
delinquent child support totaling $206,147
that were in arrears for more than 120 days.
The other 9 were making some payments.

Missing or Potentially Inaccurate SSNs
(cid:190) Comprehensive procedures were not in place to
ensure that valid social security numbers (SSN)
were on file for all obligors, limiting the
effectiveness of CSEA’s automated collection
procedures (e.g., wage withholding and income tax
refund intercepts). (Finding 2)
(cid:131) Follow-up was not conducted to ensure that
local offices investigated all reported cases of
missing SSNs. For example, one local office
only investigated 6% of 1,662 cases without
SSNs on a February 2007 report.
(cid:131) A process was not in place to verify the
accuracy of SSNs that were recorded on the
automated child support system.

Obligor Bank Accounts Not Identified and Seized
(cid:190) CSEA was not identifying or seizing funds in
certain obligor bank accounts to satisfy
delinquent child support balances. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) Since July 2005, CSEA had not identified
accounts held by delinquent obligors in
State-chartered banks.
(cid:131) Although the federal child support agency
identifies obligors with funds in federally-
charted banks, our test of 10 such obligors
found 6 with $139,000 in funds available
for seizure that were not pursued by CSEA.

Payments to Deceased Individuals
(cid:190) CSEA did not have an effective process in place to
identify payments issued to deceased individuals,
who were custodial parties. (Finding 7)
(cid:131) OLA matched CSEA records to the DHMH death
records registry and identified payments
totaling $334,000 during FYs 2006 and 2007
made to 576 deceased individuals.
(cid:131) A limited review of payments to 20 individuals
after date of death found that checks totaling
$152,000 for 13 individuals had been
negotiated 12 to 96 months after the payee’s
death. (Checks for the other 7 had not been
cashed.)

Undisbursed Funds / Account Adjustments
(cid:190) CSEA did not forward undisbursed funds to the
Comptroller of the Treasury, as required by State
law. These funds occur when a child support
check is returned to CSEA (e.g., custodial parent
moves) or collections can’t be matched with a
child support case. (Finding 8)
(cid:131) As of August 2007, CSEA was holding
approximately $1.1 million in funds that had
been undisbursed for over four years
(cid:190) In February 2006, CSEA transferred $2.4 million
from a local office’s bank account, representing
collections made prior to 2000, and retained
these funds in its central account without
determining the proper distribution. (Finding 9)
(cid:190) CSEA could not document (as was required by JCR
language) $825,000 of a $2.1 million reduction
to its cash balance in its central disbursement
account, which was also commented upon during
the prior audit. (Finding 10)

Instances of Inadequate Contract Monitoring
(cid:190) CSEA could not document that it adequately
monitored the operations of the contractor
responsible for the collections of $414 million in
FY 2007, to ensure adequate controls and
safeguards were in place. (Finding 11)
(cid:190) For contracts with 36 government agencies, which
were paid $10 million in FY 2007, to perform
certain child support services (generally on a cost-
reimbursement basis), CSEA did not verify the
accuracy of billings or take prompt action to adjust
future contract deliverables when performance
was below established goals. (Finding 12)
(cid:190) CSEA did not take sufficient action when the
contractor hired to operate two local child support
offices did not comply with contract requirements.
Monitoring reports for certain quarters in 2006
and 2007 noted that 67% to 80% of cases were
noncompliant with CSEA collection policies, yet no
penalties were assessed or corrective action plans
required. (Finding 13)

Conclusion
CSEA needs to:
(cid:190) Maximize and improve the use of all available
collection enforcement tools;
(cid:190) Establish effective procedures for identifying
payments being made to deceased individuals;
(cid:190) Ensure undisbursed funds are forwarded to
the State Comptroller as required by State law;
(cid:190) Investigate the proper disposition of funds
transferred and adjustments made to its
central bank account; and
(cid:190) Improve monitoring of contractors.
