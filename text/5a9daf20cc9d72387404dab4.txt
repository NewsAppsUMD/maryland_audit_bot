Audit Overview
(cid:190) Morgan State University (MSU) offers a variety
of baccalaureate, masters and doctoral
programs with an emphasis on business,
education, engineering and the sciences.
(cid:190) MSU enrollment is approximately 6,700
students.
(cid:190) During FY 2007, MSU revenues totaled about
$172 million, including a General Fund
appropriation of $63 million.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Telecommunications hub relocation project:
(cid:190) A $3.1 million allowance for undefined costs
was not disclosed to the BPW and was used
on other unrelated construction projects
awarded to the same contractor.
(cid:190) Questionable payments of up to $2.4 million
were made to the contractor.
(cid:190) Change orders totaling $2.3 million were
processed to purchase goods and services
outside the scope of the original contract
without BPW approval.
(cid:190) Contractor increased its bid on another project
by $68,000 with no apparent change in scope
and MSU appeared to artificially divide the
project into components to avoid BPW approval.
(cid:190) MSU authorized the contractor to complete
certain work even though the funds were not
available.

Key Audit Issues (continued)
(cid:190) General practices for capital improvement
projects:
(cid:190) Change orders were often approved after
the related work had been completed and
paid for.
(cid:190) Liquidated damages were not always
assessed even though provided for in
contract documents.
(cid:190) MSU frequently did not meet minority
business enterprise participation goals.
(cid:190) Documentation of construction project
inspections was lacking.
(cid:190) Salary overpayments totaling $121,400 were
made to two MSU employees, and the
overpayments were not referred to appropriate
State authorities, as required.

Telecommunications Hub Relocation
(cid:190) MSU hired a contractor in August 2005 to
construct a new telecommunications hub and
relocate the existing hub to a new location.
(cid:190) The original contract was for $4.3 million,
including $1.2 million in clearly defined costs
and a $3.1 million allowance for undefined
costs.
(cid:190) Change orders totaling $3.6 million were
subsequently processed, bringing the total
contract cost to $7.9 million.
(cid:190) As of June 2007, project expenditures totaled
$7.4 million.
(cid:190) We identified a number of questionable
matters that were referred to the Criminal
Division of the Office of the Attorney General.

Telecommunication Hub Relocation (continued)
(cid:190) The $3.1 million in undefined allowance costs
lacked deliverables and were not subject to
competitive bidding. This was not disclosed to
BPW when the project was submitted for approval.
(Finding 1)
(cid:190) Neither MSU nor the contractor prepared a
detailed plan of how the $3.1 million undefined
allowance was to be used prior to being spent.
(cid:190) As of June 2007, MSU had used $3 million of the
undefined allowance to finance other projects
managed by the same contractor that were
completely unrelated to the hub relocation project.
(cid:190) Project invoices paid during the period from
January 2006 to June 2007 totaling $3.3 million,
included questionable payments of up to $2.4
million. For example, MSU overpaid the contractor
$825,250 for duplicate billings. (Finding 2)

Telecommunication Hub Relocation (continued)
(cid:190) As of December 2007, MSU had taken no
action to recover or resolve any of the
questionable payments.
(cid:190) Change orders totaling $2.3 million were
processed to obtain goods and services that
were outside the scope of the original project.
(Finding 3)
(cid:190) Some of these change orders appeared to have
been artificially divided to avoid required BPW
approval (valued at less than $500,000). Other
than the campus location where the work was to
be performed, the description of the work was
identical on each change order.

Telecommunication Hub Relocation (continued)
(cid:190) MSU permitted the contractor to increase its bid
on another project by $68,000 with no apparent
change in the scope of the work to be
performed. (Finding 4)
(cid:190) Total project costs also appeared to have been
artificially divided into components to avoid
required BPW approval (valued at less than
$500,000).
(cid:190) MSU authorized the contractor to perform
certain work even though funds were not
available to pay the contractor. The contractor
deferred billings on another contract (paid for,
in part, with undefined allowance funds) for up
to nine months after the work had been
completed. (Finding 5)

General Practices - Capital Improvement Projects
(cid:190) Change orders were often not approved by
MSU senior management personnel until after
the related work had been completed and paid
for. (Finding 6)
(cid:190) MSU failed to assess liquidated damages
totaling $3.1 million against three contractors
for projects not completed timely (16 to 23
months late), and had not documented why
damages were not assessed. (Finding 7)
(cid:190) MSU did not meet its minority business
enterprise participation goals on five ($104.3
million) of nine ($120 million) projects
reviewed. (Finding 8)
(cid:190) MSU had not prepared written reports of
construction project inspections since May
2006. (Finding 9)

Salary Overpayments
(cid:190) MSU lacked adequate procedures to prevent
and detect improper salary payments to
employees on both the regular and contractual
payrolls. (Finding 10)
(cid:190) MSU improperly paid two employees
simultaneously on both its regular and
contractual payrolls for extended periods of
time, resulting in salary overpayments totaling
$121,400.
(cid:190) MSU’s efforts to investigate and recover the
overpayments were not adequate.
(cid:190) The overpayments were not referred timely to
the Attorney General’s Criminal Division or the
Chief Counsel to the Governor, as required by a
Governor’s Executive Order.

Conclusions
(cid:190) MSU should fully disclose material facts of
contracts submitted to the BPW, including the
aforementioned undefined allowance. MSU
should also comply with State procurement
regulations by not artificially dividing change
orders and projects to avoid BPW approval.
(cid:190) MSU should verify the propriety of contractor
invoices, including the aforementioned
questionable payments, recover any
overpayments and not authorize contractors to
complete work unless funding is available.
(cid:190) Change orders should be approved before the
work is authorized and paid for, and liquidated
damages should be assessed when appropriate.

Conclusions (continued)
(cid:190) MSU should ensure minority business
enterprise participation goals are met to the
extent possible, and document project
inspection activities.
(cid:190) MSU should establish procedures to ensure the
propriety of employees paid on dual payrolls,
take appropriate action to investigate and
recover salary overpayments, and refer
instances of possible criminal or unethical
employee conduct to appropriate State
officials.
