Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a follow-up review of actions taken by the Maryland
Department of Health (MDH) – Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA)
to address the findings in our November 2, 2023 audit report. In that report, we
concluded that MCPA’s accountability and compliance rating was unsatisfactory.
In March 2024, we requested an implementation status from MDH for the
findings included in the report. In response to our request, MDH provided a
status report, as of April 12, 2024, which indicated that MCPA had made minimal
progress in addressing the findings. Accordingly, we determined that we would
delay our follow up review and request an updated status report from MDH in
August 2024.
MDH, on behalf of MCPA, provided a status report, as of September 30, 2024,
indicating the implementation status of each of the 10 findings as well as its
corrective action plan, including timelines and processes to monitor the
implementation of the plan. In summary, MCPA’s status report indicated that, for
the 8 non-cybersecurity-related findings, 3 findings had been corrected (all
recommendations fully implemented) and additional corrective actions were
required to fully implement the recommendations for the remaining 5 findings.
Based on our assessment of the relative significance of the 10 findings, we
performed certain procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of actions taken by
MCPA for 4 non-cybersecurity-related findings. Our review, which was
performed during the period from December 2024 to February 2025, disclosed
that MCPA had implemented the recommendations for 2 of the 4 non-
cybersecurity-related findings and had made progress, but had not resolved some

--- Page 4 ---
or all of the recommendations in the 2 remaining findings. For the 2 that had
been corrected, this outcome was due to MCPA either meeting its established
deadline for implementation of its corrective action or implementing actions more
timely than planned.
Exhibit 1 identifies MCPA’s assessed implementation status for the 8 non-
cybersecurity-related findings, according to the status report, as well as the results
of our review for the 4 non-cybersecurity-related findings. Exhibit 2 describes, in
detail, the results of our review of the status of MCPA’s efforts to implement the
recommendations for the 2 findings that we determined MDH had not resolved
(fully corrected). To obtain a thorough understanding of the audit findings,
recommendations, and the follow-up status described in Exhibit 2, the original
November 2, 2023 audit report should be consulted due to the technical nature of
some of these findings.
MDH’s status report and response to this report, provided on behalf of MCPA, are
included as Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively. Consistent with State
law, we have redacted any cybersecurity elements in these appendices. MCPA’s
response, as presented in Appendix B, only addresses the recommendations that
we determined to be in progress. We have reviewed MCPA’s response to our
assessment of the status of those recommendations and determined that MCPA
generally agreed with our assessment.
To improve its accountability and compliance rating, MCPA should continue to
implement its corrective action plan for all findings and related recommendations,
and ensure that other areas do not deteriorate. The status of all of the audit
findings will be subject to review during our next audit of MCPA. We wish to
acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the review by MCPA.
Respectfully submitted,
Brian S. Tanen

Program Oversight
Prior Finding 4
Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA) had not established
adequate oversight to ensure that all Community First Choice (CFC)
program recipients received personal assistance services in accordance with
their plans of services.
Prior Report Recommendation 4
We recommend that MCPA
a. establish a process to ensure that all CFC recipients are monitored by nurses
(repeat), and
b. develop a plan to address the longstanding instances of non-compliance for
the aforementioned Local Health Department (LHD).
Status as Determined by the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) –
Corrected
Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) Assessment of Status – In Progress
MCPA did not fully implement recommendation a and did not make any progress
on recommendation b.
In regard to recommendation a, MCPA developed, but had not yet implemented, a
process to ensure that all CFC recipients received nurse monitoring visits.
Specifically, MCPA management advised that the new process would not be
implemented until July 2025.
In regard to recommendation b, while MCPA indicated that it would require
LHDs to submit corrective action plans based on the results of the aforementioned
review process, it did not develop a plan to address the longstanding instances of
non-compliance at Baltimore City LHD. Our analysis of MCPA records as of
February 2025 disclosed that a significant number of CFC recipients at Baltimore
City LHD were overdue for a nurse monitoring visit, including 1,143 CFC
recipients who were more than one year overdue.
5

--- Page 8 ---
Prior Finding 5
MCPA did not monitor the utilization control agent (UCA) contractor to
ensure continued stay reviews (CSRs) of Medicaid recipients receiving
services from nursing facilities were performed timely.
Prior Report Recommendation 5
We recommend that MCPA monitor the UCA vendor to ensure CSRs are
performed timely and assess liquidated damages as permitted by the contract
(repeat).
Status as Determined by MDH – Corrected
OLA Assessment of Status – In Progress
MCPA did not fully implement the recommendation. Specifically, as of February
2025, MCPA was still developing a procedure to independently verify that the
UCA vendor conducted CSRs timely. Accordingly, MCPA also could not readily
determine whether liquidated damages should be assessed.

Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We conducted a follow-up review of the actions taken by the Maryland
Department of Health (MDH) – Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA)
to address the findings in our November 2, 2023 audit report. In that report, we
concluded that MCPA’s accountability and compliance rating was unsatisfactory.
The purpose of our review was to determine the status of MCPA’s corrective
actions to address certain of our audit findings and recommendations. As
customary, our review did not include all prior report findings and
recommendations, but a number judgmentally selected based on our assessment
of significance. This review was conducted under the authority of Section 2-
1220(a)(4) of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland
and was based on our long-standing practice of performing a follow-up review
whenever an agency receives an unsatisfactory rating in its fiscal compliance
audit report. The rating system was established, in accordance with State
Government Article, Section 2-1221, of the Annotated Code of Maryland, for the
purpose of determining an overall evaluation of an agency’s fiscal accountability
and compliance with State laws and regulations.
Our review consisted of obtaining a status report from MDH, on behalf of MCPA
as of September 30, 2024, which described the level of implementation of each
prior audit report finding, as well as obtaining additional clarifications from
MCPA of the actions taken to resolve the selected findings. Our review also
consisted of performing tests and analyses of certain information and holding
discussions with MCPA personnel, as we deemed necessary, to determine the
status of MCPA’s corrective actions to address the selected findings, including the
related recommendations, from our November 2, 2023 audit report.
State Government Article Section 2-1224(i) requires that we redact in a manner
consistent with auditing best practices any cybersecurity findings before a report
is made available to the public. This results in the issuance of two different
versions of a report that contains cybersecurity findings – a redacted version for
the public and an unredacted version for government officials responsible for
acting on our audit recommendations.
The State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b), states that
cybersecurity is defined as “processes or capabilities wherein systems,
communications, and information are protected and defended against damage,
unauthorized use or modification, and exploitation”. Based on that definition, and
in our professional judgment, we concluded that findings in this report fall under
that definition. Consequently, for the publicly available report all specifics as to
7

--- Page 10 ---
the nature of the cybersecurity findings and required corrective actions have been
redacted. We have determined that such aforementioned practices support the
redaction of this information from the public report. The specifics of the
cybersecurity findings have been communicated to MCPA and those parties
responsible for acting on our recommendations in an unredacted report.
This review did not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Had we conducted an audit in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, other matters
may have come to our attention that would have been reported.
Our review was conducted primarily during the period from December 2024 to
February 2025, and our assessment of the status of MCPA’s corrective actions
was performed at the time of our review.
MDH’s response, on behalf of MCPA, to our follow-up review is included as an
appendix to this report. Depending on the version of the report, responses to any
cybersecurity findings may be redacted in accordance with State law. As
prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, we will advise MDH regarding the results of our review of its
response.
