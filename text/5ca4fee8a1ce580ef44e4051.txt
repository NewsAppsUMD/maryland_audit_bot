Dear Senator King and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by the Maryland
Department of Health Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA) to resolve the repeat
findings in our August 18, 2017 audit report. This review was conducted in accordance with a
requirement specified in the April 2018 Joint Chairmen‘s Report (JCR), pages 91 and 92. The
JCR required that, prior to the release of $100,000 of its administrative appropriation for fiscal
year 2019, MCPA musttake corrective action with respect to all repeat audit findings on or before
November 1, 2018. The ICR language further provided that OLA submit a report to the budget
committees listing each repeat audit finding along with a determination that each finding was
corrected. The OLA report is required to be submitted to allow 45 days for the budget committees
to review and release the funds prior to the end ofthe fiscal year.
In accordance with the April 2018 requirement, MCPA provided a report to OLA, dated
October 30, 2018, detailing the corrective actions that it had taken with respect to a number of
findings, including 5 ofthe 6 repeat audit findings (Exhibit 1). The MCPA status report indicated
that corrective actions had been completed to address Findings 2, 4, and 6, and that corrective
actions were ongoing for findings 7 and 11. The status report did not address Finding 5. We did
not assess the corrective actions taken for certain recommendations included on MCPA’s status
report were not applicable to repeat findings.
We reviewed the MCPA status report and related documentation, performed tests and
analyses ofthe information, and held discussion with MCPA personnel as necessary to assess the
implementationstatus ofthe related recommendations, includingthose relatedto Finding 5. Based
on our review, we determined that Findings 2, 4, 6, and 11 were resolved, but that MCPA had not
taken sufficient actions to correct findings 5 and 7 (Exhibit 2). Our assessment ofthe two repeat
findings that had not been resolved is included in Exhibit 3.

MCPA’s CorrectiveActions (sinceAugust2017 auditreport)
MCPAhasexperienceddifficultyprocuring a recoveryauditcontractortoperformthe post-
payment auditofhospital claims.Since Mayof2013, MCPAhascompleted and posted a
Requestfor Proposal (RFP)tosolicita recoveryauditcontractoronfive occasions (May2013,
October2013, November2014, May2017, and May2018). The RFPwassuccessfullyawarded
on onlyone occasion (November2014).The recoveryauditcontractorbegan workon August
17, 2015 however,thecontractwasterminated on August 26, 2016becausethecontractor
failedto meetthe requirements. MCPAreviewedvarious responsesfromvendors identifying
issueswiththe RFPconsistingofvendors unabletocompletethetask becauseofprior
commitments, being unsure howto completethefinancial proposal, and beingunabletowork
on a 100%contingencycontract.On November8, 2017, MCPA requested and received awaiver
from CMStowaivethe RACrequirements. Asa result,the REP was revisedtoeliminatethe
federal contingencyfee maximum rates, makingthe RFP more reasonable forprospective
vendors. On May3, 2018, the new RFPwas posted receivingoneproperlysubmitted proposal.
An extension wasgranted and was repostedonJuly24, 2018.Thesecond postingledtothree
properlysubmitted proposalswhich arecurrentlybeingreviewed. MCPAanticipateshavinga
contractin place byMarch 1, 2019andto have a recoveryauditcontractorbegin auditingby
April 1, 2019.
As a contingency plan,the DIG completesauditsduringperiodsoftimewhen recoveryaudit
contractorsare notin place. However,the OlG has insufficientstafftocomplete post-payment
auditsofhospital claims. In theeventthe RFPIsunsuccessful,theOIG plansto request
additionalstaff, includingnursesand hospital bill coderswith expertisein recoveryaudits,to
completetherecoveryaudIts.The OIG furtherplanstoaugmentcurrentstaffbyproviding
trainingin health claimscoding.
To addressthe notification ofhospitalsto retain claimsdata untilaudited, MCPAdistributed a
transmittal on December 13, 2017to HospitalAdministratorsdirecting all hospitalsto retain
medical recordsfromJanuary 1, 2009todate,forpurposesofconducting hospital claims

OLA had previously assessed the status ofthis recommendation duringa follow-upreview conducted in response
to MCPA’s receipt ofan unsatisfactoryaccountabilityand compliance rating. In the resultantspecial review
reporton that follow-up, datedNovember 8, 2018, OLA reportedthat MCPA had self- assessed the status ofthat
finding as “in progress”, but that OLA had deemed the recommendation to be “corrected.” Duringthe course of
this JCR follow-up OLA re-evaluated the status and after amore comprehensive review, found that although some
progress had indeed been made, the finding has not been satisfactorily resolved.

OLA’s Assessments Regarding Repeat Findings That Were Not Resolved
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 5
—
We recommend that MCPA
b. establish initial accountability over all insurance referrals received and ensure all are
properly investigated in a timely manner, in accordance with federal regulations
(repeat); and
c. conduct documented monthly supervisory reviews ofinvestigative efforts to ensure
appropriate conclusions were reached (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Although MCPA had established a process for tracking all referrals received, and made strides in
investigating referrals within 60 days as required by federal regulations, certain referrals were
not timely investigated. Specifically, as ofSeptember 201$ MCPA had not investigated 64,700
received during the period from May 2017 through July 201$2 from Managed Care
Organizations (MCO). MCPA management advised us that MCO referrals require extensive
manual processing resulting in the delay and that they are seeking to automate the MCO referral
process to enable more efficient investigation ofthese referrals.
In April 201$, MCPA also implemented a supervisory review process ofthe investigative efforts,
but it was not sufficient, as only investigations conducted on one day per month were to be
reviewed. In addition, the reviews were not conducted ofreferrals that were manually
investigated (such as the aforementioned MCO referrals). furthermore, documentation issues
remain, as the reviews did not indicate how many investigations were reviewed or the results of
the reviews.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 7
—
We recommend that MCPA
a. ensure that hospital claims are audited in a timely manner (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Since calendar year 2007, there has been a very limited number ofhospital claims audits
performed by MDH. MCPA attributes the primary cause to repeated, unsuccessful attempts to
procure an audit vendor. Specifically, in its status report, MCPA summarized its attempts to
procure a vendor to conduct hospital claim audits under five separate procurements and advised
that it anticipates having a new vendor under contract to conduct the audits by April 1, 2019.
MCPA further stated that due to insufficient staffing, the Office ofInspector General (OIG) was
not able to perform the audits during the extended period that MDH was procuring a vendor.
2 Duringthat period, atotal of310,453 referrals were received from all sources.

--- Page 13 ---
Exhibit 3 to April 1, 2019 Letter to Joint Chairmen
MCPA management advised OLA that the new vendor will audit claims dating back to calendar
year 2017 and MDH personnel will audit claims for calendar years 2014 through 2016. Claims
processed between calendar years 2007 and 2013 will not be subject to audit. Furthermore, as
noted in our August 18, 2017 audit report, MCPA management notified the hospitals in May
2013 to retain all medical records supporting claims beyond the six year requirement in
Maryland regulations. In December 2017, MCPA issued another request for hospitals to retain
all medical records supporting claims from January 1, 2009 until the claims have been audited.
As such, documentation for claims processed from calendar year 2008 may no longer be
available for audit.
