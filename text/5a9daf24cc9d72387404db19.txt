(cid:190) Audits are performed in accordance with State
law, which requires OLA to audit all 24 public
school systems once over a six-year period. As
of January 2009, 14 reports have been issued.
(cid:190) The purpose of the audits is to evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the school
system’s financial management practices in
safeguarding assets and its use of financial
resources.
(cid:190) Audit approach consists of 11 functional areas
previously approved by the Joint Audit
Committee, as required by State law.
(cid:190) When warranted, we used the work of other
auditors to avoid duplication of effort.

Key Findings – Internal Controls
Procurements & Disbursements – (p.18-19, 40)

prices and support documentation prior to
payment.
(cid:131) Complete procurement documentation was not
maintained for certain construction contracts.

Key Findings – Efficiency and Effectiveness
Transportation – (pgs.46-49)
(cid:131) The cost efficiency of contracting out its regular
bus services rather than owing and operating the
bus fleet had not been determined.
(cid:131) Under the current arrangement which has
numerous pay elements, HCPS assumes nearly all
the risks for bus operations while essentially
guaranteeing a profit to bus contractors.
(cid:131) The per vehicle allotment element provides for the
contractor to recover the full cost of a bus plus a
return on investment based on the bus’ cost that
is substantially above market rates. Because the
rates are not adjusted, HCPS will pay out
approximately $9 million more than if the prime
rate was used for 336 buses bought since 1996.
(cid:131) Cost comparisons are needed when procuring
bulk fuel for vehicles.
