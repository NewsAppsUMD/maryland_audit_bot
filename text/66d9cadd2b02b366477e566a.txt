Reports Recommended for Committee Action
December 1, 2023 to August 31, 2024
The following audit reports have been recommended for follow-up action by the Joint Audit
and Evaluation Committee (JAEC). The basis of the recommendation could include the
number and significance of the audit findings, the agency receiving an “unsatisfactory” rating
(which will necessitate future OLA follow-up), and/or contentious or controversial issues that
remain unresolved or have related recommendations in a state of implementation (that is,
are “in–progress” by the agency). The determination of whether to recommend a JAEC
follow-up letter (letter of concern) or hearing, is based on a subjective determination by the
OLA using professional judgment. The purpose of a “follow-up letter” from the Committee is
to convey the Legislature’s formal concern and reinforce the Committee’s commitment to
ensure appropriate accountability is established (via the audit recommendations) for those
audits or findings that do not rise to the level of a hearing.
1) Department of Information Technology (DoIT) (3/29/24 – 16 findings, DoIT’s
accountability and compliance level was unsatisfactory due to the significance of
the audit findings and the number of repeat findings)
See separate hearing presentation and confidential addendum.
