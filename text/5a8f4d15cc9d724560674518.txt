AGENCY HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership
consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
The Commission has the following responsibilities:
1. Adopting the rules and regulations for the recreational and commercial taking or catching
of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams from the Potomac River;
2. Issuing licenses for the taking or catching of finfish, crabs, oysters, and clams and for
boats, vessels, and related equipment;
3. Imposing an inspection tax on oysters caught in the Potomac River; and
4. Reseeding and replanting oyster bars.
The Commission’s regulations carry the full force and effect of law, and the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission jointly enforce the regulations.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the following
sources.
2012 2011
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000
Federal grant 104,147 109,348
Sport fishing licenses 132,370 129,528
Commercial fishing licenses 74,790 76,215
Commercial crab licenses 71,000 71,825
Commercial oyster licenses 3,570 3,695
Commercial license surcharge 41,650 -
Oyster bushel tax 328 209
Interest and miscellaneous 38,035 15,406
Total revenue $754,640 $694,976
The Commission’s revenues increased by nine percent for fiscal year 2012 mainly due to an increase
in the sale of sport fishing and commercial licenses and a new commercial license registration fee, discussed
below. Additionally, the large increase in revenues for interest and miscellaneous is attributable to
approximately $20,000 in revenues resulting from a new tagging program for crab pot identifications, the
continuation of striped bass tagging requirements, and the collection of shipping fees. It also includes
revenue from the sale of the Commission’s vehicle, which was replaced. In the past five years, sport fishing
license revenues have trended upwards and commercial licenses are now on an upward trend as can be seen in
the following chart:

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:

Federal grant 92,275 106,772
Contractual services 69,665 77,266

Operating Expenses 609,120 616,124
Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Oyster development 31,500 15,000

Reserve Expenses 81,500 65,000
Total Expenses $690,620 $681,124

Operating expenses decreased by $7,004 or one percent from fiscal year 2011. This is attributable to
a decrease in personnel and contractual expenses and an increase in fixed asset purchases. Personnel costs
decreased due to the retirement of one employee and the elimination of a part time position. Contractual
service expenses decreased due to funding certain fish studies with Federal grants rather than general
operating funds in fiscal year 2012. Fixed asset purchases included the purchase of a new vehicle for the
Executive Secretary. Other expense categories remained relatively unchanged.
The Commission is attempting to determine the best way to develop a self-sustaining oyster industry
in the Potomac and continues to retain funds in order to support future oyster work in the Potomac River.
However, in order to replace the funds held in reserve as they are used, the Commission established new
surcharges for oyster licenses and commercial licenses in 2012. The Commission realized $41,650 in
revenues from these surcharges in fiscal year 2012.
During fiscal year 2012, the Commission set aside an additional $31,500 to fund future oyster work
and $50,000 to fund retiree health insurance. Interest accrues on these accounts at the market rate.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2012 with an operating gain of $145,520. After factoring in the
reserve expense of $81,500, the Commission’s operating gain was $64,020. The Commission’s net gain has
constantly increased over the last five years due to continued efforts to become more efficient in their
operations.
The ability of the Commission to continue to retain more cash each year is due to the fact that they
performed no major projects in either fiscal year 2011 or 2012, and they are striving for continued efficiency
in operations. The Commission closed fiscal year 2012 with a cash balance of $473,491 to include $175,862
in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts and a separate Virginia investment pool account for
retiree health care reserves, with a balance of $176,089 as of June 30, 2012.

The Honorable John M. O’Bannon, III
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission
for the year ended June 30, 2012. We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our
audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions in the
Commission’s accounting system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls, and test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal control
and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is a process designed to provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, effectiveness and
efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual, sufficient to
plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of our audit
procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of transactions,
and account balances.
Capital assets Cash receipting
Contractual services expenses License revenues
Payroll expenses Federal grant revenues and expenses
