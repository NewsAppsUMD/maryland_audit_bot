Background Information
Small, Minority, and Women-Owned Businesses Account
During the 2007 special session, the General Assembly enacted legislation to
license video lottery terminal (VLT) gaming in Maryland contingent on the
legislation being ratified by the voters of the State. In the November 2008 general
election, the voters of Maryland ratified a constitutional amendment authorizing
VLTs in the State. As a result of the ratification of the constitutional amendment,
the Small, Minority, and Women-Owned Businesses Account was established; the
legislation creating the Account was similarly enacted during the 2007 special
session.
State Law generally requires that 1.5 percent of VLT proceeds be paid into the
Account, which is a special, nonlapsing fund administered by the Comptroller of
Maryland under the authority of the Board of Public Works (BPW). State Law
specifies that the Account is to be used by the BPW to make grants to eligible
fund managers to provide investment capital and loans to small, minority, and
women-owned businesses in the State, of which at least 50 percent must be
allocated to such businesses in the jurisdictions and communities surrounding a
video lottery facility. BPW is responsible for ensuring that the fund managers
allocate the funds in accordance with the State law.
Video Lottery Facility Licenses and Operations
Licenses have been awarded to operate VLT casinos in Cecil, Worcester, Anne
Arundel, and Allegany Counties and Baltimore City. The casinos in Cecil,
Worcester, Anne Arundel, and Allegany Counties began VLT gaming operations
on September 27, 2010, January 4, 2011, June 6, 2012, and May 22, 2013,
respectively. VLT gaming operations have not begun in Baltimore City.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the finding contained in our
preceding audit report dated October 16, 2012. We determined that the BPW
satisfactorily addressed this finding.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Scope and Objectives
As required by Section 9-1A-35 of the State Government Article of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, we conducted an audit to evaluate the utilization of the video
lottery terminal (VLT) funds that are allocated to small, minority, and women-
owned businesses by eligible fund managers who received grants from the Board
of Public Works (BPW). As part of the audit, we also determined that the
appropriate amounts were paid into the Account, disbursements or transfers from
the Account were properly authorized, and proper accountability was established
over the Account. Our audit covered Account activity for the period beginning
July 1, 2012 and ending June 30, 2013.
Our audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the
evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions
based on our audit objectives.
Methodology
To accomplish our objectives, we interviewed employees of the BPW and the
Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED), which, as of
August 22, 2012, was designated by the BPW to manage the grant program
authorized by State law. We also reviewed the records maintained by the
Comptroller of Maryland for the Account, including the one transfer from the
Account to DBED for administrative costs. Finally, we verified that the amounts
transferred into the Account during fiscal year 2013 were proper based on the
total VLT revenue reflected in the records of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming
Control Agency.1 As of June 30, 2013, no disbursements to any fund managers
had been made from the Account.
Our fieldwork was completed during the period from April through September
2013. A copy of the draft report was provided to the BPW. Since there are no
recommendations in this report, a written response was not necessary.
1 Chapter 1, Special Session 2, Laws of Maryland 2013, effective October 1, 2012, changed the
Agency’s name from the State Lottery Agency to the State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency.

Conclusions
We concluded that proper accountability had been established over the Account.
Specifically, as of June 30, 2013, the Account had been funded as required by law
and the one transfer from the Account to another State fund was made in
accordance with law.
At the request of the Governor, the BPW designated DBED as the administering
agency for the grant program. On August 22, 2012, the BPW entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DBED for DBED to manage the
grants program on BPW’s behalf. DBED engaged in a competitive procurement
process and recommended the award of $7.9 million in grant funds to three fund
managers. On April 17, 2013, the BPW approved the award to the three fund
managers. As of June 30, 2013, no Account funds had yet been disbursed to these
fund managers to provide investment capital and loans to small, minority, and
women-owned businesses in the State. Subsequent to our audit fieldwork, the
BPW disbursed approximately $1.6 million to fund managers; these and other
fiscal year 2014 disbursements will be reviewed during our next audit of the
Account.
Since its inception through June 30, 2013, the Small, Minority, and Women-
Owned Businesses Account has been properly credited with VLT proceeds as
specified by law. The Account began receiving funds during fiscal year 2011
when the first VLT facility began gaming operations.
A transfer of $50,000 from the Account to DBED was made for the costs of
administering the grant program in fiscal year 2013. This transfer was authorized
by the MOU that BPW entered into with DBED to manage the grants program.
A summary of Account activity through June 30, 2013, according to the
Comptroller’s accounting records, is presented below.
Summary of Account Activity
Fiscal Year 2013
Account Balance – July 1, 2012 $ 2,606,388
