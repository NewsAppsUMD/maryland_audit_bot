Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013
1) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Developmental Disabilities Administration
(DDA) (10/2/13 – 28 pages – 13 Findings)
• DDA did not monitor service coordinators to ensure that its consumers received services in
accordance with their individual service plans. As of June 30, 2012, DDA contracted with 15
vendors, who were responsible for monitoring 24,092 consumers with FY 2012 service
expenditures totaling $759 million. Furthermore, DDA did not ensure that the service
coordinators performed annual Medicaid eligibility reassessments.
• DDA did not take certain actions to maximize the recovery of federal funds.
 DDA’s methodology for determining certain federal reimbursement rates did not
accurately reflect the costs incurred. OLA testing of FY 2011 and 2012 reimbursement
rates for one program noted that DDA’s reimbursable costs exceeded reimbursements
by $2.4 million.
 DDA did not ensure that certain provider claims were submitted for processing and
federal reimbursement or that federal fund reimbursement requests were timely. Federal
funds and interest income totaling as much as $5.5 million were not obtained or were
lost.
 DDA did not investigate federal fund reimbursement claims totaling $2.2 million that were
rejected due to system edits. OLA tests identified $820,000 that was recoverable had
DDA investigated and resubmitted corrected claims.
• DDA did not ensure the accuracy of provider-reported consumers’ contribution to care (CTC)
amounts and, consequently, may have paid providers more that it was responsible for, since the
impact of CTC is to reduce DDA’s provider payments.
• DDA allowed the use of $610,000 derived from an additional tax on alcoholic beverages to
purchase 23 vehicles for consumers on its waiting list, even though its policies did not
specifically allow such use of the funds.
• DDA did not ensure that annual reports from certain providers were submitted timely and the
reports contained information necessary to identify provider overpayments and underpayments
based on actual services.
• Accounts receivable processes did not ensure that all funds owed DDA were recovered.
• DDA did not maintain documentation to support certain accounting adjustments and had not
established proper security access controls over critical data such as sensitive consumer
information and service rates.

Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013
2) Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) (10/29/13 – 22 Pages – 9 Findings)
• MHEC did not take intended actions to increase need-based scholarship awards by using
accumulated scholarship funds in the Need-Based Student Financial Assistance Fund. As of
June 30, 2013, the Fund balance totaled $17.2 million, and based on grant award information
for the 2011-2012 academic year, OLA estimated that 7,800 of the 31,000 applicants on
MHEC’s waiting list could have received need-based scholarships.
• Financial aid award determinations, such as those performed by colleges, were not
independently reviewed, as required by MHEC policy, to ensure their propriety, and critical
transactions recorded in MHEC’s automated student financial aid system were not
independently verified.
• Adequate procedures and controls were not in place to ensure students completed service
obligations that were a condition for certain financial aid awards (such as working as a full-time
nurse) or repaid the awards.
• MHEC did not ensure that retirement and pension contributions for certain community college
employees were proper and that the State was being properly reimbursed by community
colleges, as required by State law, for contributions funded by federal assistance. In FY 2012,
the State funded (through MHEC) retirement and pension contributions for community college
employees totaling $48.8 million; the community colleges reimbursed the State $2.7 million for
contributions covered by federal funds.
• MHEC had not established sufficient monitoring and security controls over its IT network. For
example, sensitive personally identifiable information stored on a publicly accessible web server
was not secured.
• MHEC did not adequately control its mail collections, which totaled $6.4 million in FY 2012.
