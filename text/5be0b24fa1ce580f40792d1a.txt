Exhibit 2
Detailed Comments on the Findings for Which
the Office of Legislative Audits Deemed the
Implementation Status to be “In Progress”
Claims Processing
Prior Finding 3
UEF did not adequately review indemnity and medical claim payments for
propriety.
Prior Report Recommendation 3
We recommended that UEF
a. conduct independent supervisory reviews of indemnity payments to ensure the
payments are valid and accurate (repeat); and
b. establish a documented procedure to verify, at least on a test basis, that
medical claim payments were proper based on supporting documentation
(repeat).
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – In Progress
UEF established procedures to address recommendation a, but did not fully
address recommendation b.
For recommendation b, UEF had not established a documented procedure to
verify that medical claim payments were proper based on supporting
documentation. Specifically, although UEF advised us that verifications are
performed on a test basis, it did not document which medical claim payments it
selected for review and did not document the basis for selecting the payments to
verify.
5

--- Page 8 ---
Prior Finding 4
UEF violated State procurement regulations to obtain claims processing and
related services from 11 vendors, did not have written agreements with the
vendors, and did not adequately monitor the vendors’ services and verify
their billings. During the period from January 2014 to April 2017, UEF paid
these vendors approximately $3.5 million.
Prior Report Recommendation 4
We recommended that UEF
a. comply with the procurement and contract provisions of the State procurement
regulations by soliciting competitive bids and executing written contracts for
the claims processing and related services that include all relevant contract
provisions (repeat),
b. ensure that invoiced amounts are supported and agree to contract-approved
rates and level of services prior to approving invoices for payment,
c. establish a process for monitoring vendor performance for claims processing
and related functions, and
d. re-submit the emergency contract award to the BPW.
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – No Progress
UEF did not adequately address any of the audit recommendations. Therefore,
virtually no progress was made. UEF is now using only one vendor for claims
processing and related services instead of using multiple vendors. As noted in our
prior finding, UEF entered into an emergency contract with a vendor for claims
processing and related services for an 18-month term beginning September 1,
2017 at an estimated cost of $994,500 (plus fees).
With regard to recommendation a, UEF did not comply with provisions of the
State procurement regulations with respect to certain additional services procured.
Specifically, beginning in February 2018, UEF began paying the claims
processing vendor a separate fee for services provided by an individual employed
by the vendor who was handling the settlement of claims associated with a large
company’s bankruptcy. While the emergency contract with this vendor included
a provision for additional services, UEF did not enter into a contract modification
with the vendor for these services to reflect agreed-upon terms. Furthermore, the
vendor’s invoices did not specify the hours worked by this individual nor the
number of claims handled to support the work performed. During the period from
February to August 2018, UEF paid $95,550 to the vendor for this individual’s
services.
For recommendation b, we determined that UEF did not ensure invoiced amounts
from the vendor were supported and agreed to contract-approved rates.
6

--- Page 9 ---
Specifically, UEF paid the vendor a fixed monthly fee of $82,875, which is based
on a 12-month contract term, rather than the required $55,250 based on the actual
18-month term. UEF management advised us that it was aware of this
discrepancy, and that it had an informal understanding with the vendor that the
$994,500 estimated cost would be paid over a 12-month period rather than the 18-
month period specified in the contract. UEF management further advised that it
would continue to compensate the vendor at the monthly rate of $82,875 for the
remaining six months of the contract, essentially overpaying the contract by
$497,250. As of August 2018, UEF had paid the vendor approximately $1.1
million, consisting of $994,500 for claims administration fees, $12,000 for other
fees, and $95,550 for the aforementioned individual’s services.
Regarding recommendation c, UEF had not established a process to monitor
vendor performance for claims processing and related functions even though the
contract contains provisions establishing criteria for claims processing and
medical bill review timeliness. For example, the contract requires that medical
bill reviews be completed within five days.
Finally, regarding recommendation d, the aforementioned emergency contract
was initially withdrawn from the Board of Public Works (BPW) agenda before
the meeting date but was re-submitted and approved by BPW on December 20,
2017, as recommended. However, as noted above, UEF was compensating the
vendor at rates that exceeded the contract terms, and the contract terms presented
to BPW did not reflect this informal arrangement.
Cash Receipts
Prior Finding 5
UEF did not have adequate procedures and controls to ensure that all
collections were deposited.
Prior Report Recommendation 5
We recommended that UEF
a. ensure that the initial record of collections is forwarded directly to an
independent employee to perform the deposit verification function (repeat),
b. ensure that all deposits are made intact,
c. ensure that collections are properly safeguarded and are transported directly to
the bank for deposit no later than the next business day,
d. ensure that the cash receipts and accounts receivable duties are adequately
separated (repeat), and
e. consider the feasibility of using a bank lockbox account to receive collections.
7

--- Page 10 ---
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – In Progress
UEF had established adequate procedures and controls to address
recommendations b and c and adequately addressed recommendation e.
However, UEF did not fully address recommendations a and d.
For recommendation a, the initial record of collections (an adding machine tape)
was not forwarded directly to the employee responsible for independently
verifying that all collections had been deposited. Instead, the initial record and
related collections were forwarded to two employees responsible for preparing the
bank deposits, recording the deposits in the State's accounting records, and
depositing the collections at the bank. Furthermore, the employee responsible for
verifying that all collections had been deposited was not independent as this
employee had access to the safe where collections were stored overnight.
For recommendation d, the responsibilities for the cash receipts and accounts
receivable functions were not separated since three employees involved in the
collection process had the capabilities to record the collections and any
adjustments in the related automated accounts receivable records.
Information Systems Security and Control
Prior Finding 8
UEF did not have an information systems disaster recovery plan.
Prior Report Recommendation 8
We recommended that UEF develop and implement a comprehensive disaster
recovery plan, in accordance with the Information Technology (IT) Disaster
Recovery Guidelines (repeat).
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – In Progress
UEF had not completely addressed the recommendation for development and
implementation of a disaster recovery plan (DRP). UEF, working together with
its information technology support vendor, had developed a draft DRP document,
which was currently under management review. We examined the draft DRP
document and determined that sections existed for recommended key plan
elements such as concept of operations, notification and activation procedures,
recovery strategies (including use of alternate sites) and reconstitution procedures.
However, for these same plan elements, the plan lacked detailed content
describing specific steps, information, and other materials necessary for a
complete DRP, which could be both tested and executed if necessary.

Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We conducted a follow-up review of the actions taken by the Uninsured
Employers’ Fund (UEF) to address the findings in our January 3, 2018 audit
report. In that report, we concluded that UEF’s fiscal accountability and
compliance rating was unsatisfactory.
The purpose of our review was to determine the status of UEF’s corrective actions
to address certain of our audit findings. This review was conducted under the
authority of Section 2-1220(a)(4) of the State Government Article and was based
on our long-standing practice of performing a follow-up review whenever an
agency receives an unsatisfactory rating in its fiscal compliance audit report. The
rating system was established, in accordance with State Government Article,
Section 2-1221 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, for the purpose of
determining an overall evaluation of an agency’s fiscal accountability and
compliance with State laws and regulations.
Our review consisted of obtaining a status report from UEF, as of June 29, 2018,
which described the level of implementation of each prior audit report finding.
Our review also consisted of performing tests and analyses of selected
information and holding discussions with UEF personnel, as we deemed
necessary to determine the status of UEF’s corrective actions to address selected
findings from our January 3, 2018 audit report.
This review did not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Had we conducted an audit in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, other matters
may have come to our attention that would have been reported.
Our review was conducted primarily during the period from July to August 2018,
and our assessment of the status of UEF’s corrective actions was performed at the
time of our review.
UEF’s response to our follow-up review is included as an appendix to this report.
As prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, we will advise UEF regarding the results of our review of its
response.

Dear Mr. Barnickel:
Attached please find The Maryland Uninsured Employer’s Fund (UEF) status report for
the fiscal compliance audit for the period beginning November 14, 2013 and ending November
27, 2016 for your review and consideration.
We continue the ongoing process of responding to the Recommendations contained in the
audit.
I will note that I am the contact person to whom inquiries regarding this matter should be
addressed.
The UEF is available to meet with you, or with your staff, if you wish to discuss any of
these items in more detail. I would advise that any such meeting should have also in attendance
representatives of our technical vendor, DP Solutions, as well as the UEF’s CFO Andrew
Anderson so I would request a series of available dates from the OLA if a further in-person meeting
is desired for scheduling purposes.
The UEF appreciates working with the Office of Legislative Audits to comply with the
Recommendations contained in the relevant audit as it continues to improve the function and
performance of the agency.

UNINSURED EMPLOYERS’ FUND
STATUS REPORT TO AUDIT REPORT
JUNE 29, 2018
Accounts Receivable
Finding 1
UEF did not conduct independent reviews of accounts receivable transactions.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that UEF establish a process to ensure the propriety of transactions
recorded in its accounts receivable records. Specifically, we recommend that UEF perform
independent reviews to ensure that all WCC awards and properly authorized adjustments
are accurately entered into its accounts receivable records (repeat). We advised UEF on
accomplishing the necessary separation of duties using existing personnel.
Status of UEF Response to Recommendation 1
In Progress. As with all audit finding and recommendations, the UEF has been working towards
compliance with this Recommendation for several months.
As noted in our December 6, 2017 response to the audit, the UEF had a process in place for
reviewing awards and payments that involves multiple employees who review awards and
adjustments. As a result of the audit, that system was reviewed and evaluated to comply with this
recommendation.
An important part of that review has been the cooperation and ongoing efforts between the UEF,
our technical vendor DP Solutions and our third-party claims administrator, Corvel, to attempt to
develop an electronic system to transfer relevant “accounts receivable” data from the Workers’
Compensation Commission (WCC) data the UEF receives to the system utilized by the State of
Maryland for the preparation of the relevant accounts receivable. Due to the technical nature of
the various computer systems involved this has proved to be a challenging task. After five
months of work it is unclear whether or not the process of electronic transfer is possible. Work
on this remains ongoing but, absent giving up, it cannot be predicted with certainty when this
process will be completed or if it is possible.
Be that as it may, as to the actual audit finding and recommendation regarding the propriety of
transactions recorded in accounts receivable, the UEF, the UEF has accomplished the following
items:

--- Page 15 ---
1) Our review of the system indicated that the WCC had not been providing the UEF
with Temporary Total Disability Orders which are required for the UEF to assess the
15% assessment due on such awards. The UEF contacted the WCC and this situation
has been corrected. Currently the UEF is working on entering the data supplied by the
WCC for such orders.
2) Pursuant to that issue, and in order to facilitate the entry of accounts receivable data,
the UEF has hired, effective July 2, 2018, an employee to assist with this issue,
including data entry, as well as other issues.
3) Currently one of two employees entered the relevant data by hand into the computer
system. It is reviewed by the UEF CFO on a random basis to insure accuracy. When
fully trained, the new employee noted in Item 2 above will also be checking over
completed accounts receivable randomly to insure accuracy.
Finding 2
UEF did not adequately monitor and pursue collection of delinquent accounts. As of
January 5, 2017, there were 3,980 delinquent accounts totaling $5.2 million that, based on
their age, should have been referred to CCU.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that UEF
a. investigate and take the necessary corrective actions to resolve the noted deficiencies
(generate dunning notices and produce accurate accounts receivable aging reports) to
ensure that the accounting system provides sufficient information to monitor and
pursue collection activities (repeat),
b. refer delinquent accounts to CCU for collection as required (repeat), and
c. establish a process to identify and refer delinquent employers to
applicable State licensing authorities for license or permit suspension (repeat).
Status of UEF Response to Recommendation 2
a. In Progress. The correction of deficiencies in the collection of delinquent accounts has
been a major priority of the agency. The UEF has been evaluating and addressing the
condition and effectiveness of the entire system of collections and assessments utilized by
the agency. Systems in different collection and billing areas have been examined and
changes implemented – and in certain cases established or re-established - and will
continue to be developed, implemented, evaluated and adjusted, and are being monitored
to ensure that this recommendation is implemented.
The UEF has made addressed the lack of adequate and effective collection processes by
the Agency. A number of systems have already been established regarding billing and
collections regarding fines, penalties, assessments and employer debts. This process

--- Page 16 ---
remains ongoing. It includes, among other items, the re-establishment of a program to
suspend business licenses for enforcement purposes, which has again begun to occur and
is ongoing for which hearings are currently routinely scheduled and conducted.
The UEF is commencing criminal cases, when appropriate, against appropriate employers
who fail to repay compensation payments made to claimants by the Agency.
Finally, the UEF has developed a completely new protocol to deal with uninsured
employer obligations much earlier in the process which is beginning on July 1, 2108. The
program is designed to comply with the statute and to ensure that such obligations are
recognized and collection initiated contemporaneously with the issuance of WCC Orders
and any resulting failure by the uninsured employer to accept responsibility for payments
pursuant to those Orders to pay claims or to reimburse the Fund for all payments made
pursuant to a claim found by the WCC to be the responsibility of that uninsured
employer.
As of July 1, 2018, the program will work as follows: upon receipt of an Order for
payment by the UEF from the WCC the UEF will send letters to both the claimant ands
to the uninsured employer. The claimant will be instructed, pursuant to the statute, to
request payment from the employer and to notify the UEF or the response of the
employer. The employer will be forwarded a copy of the Order and instructed to notify
the UEF as to its agreement to pay the Order. After 30 days, the employer will receive a
further letter instructing it of its obligation to pay and giving it 10 days to contact the
UEF regarding the matter. After the 10 days the employer will receive a final letter
notifying it that the UEF will pursue all available remedies, including criminal
prosecution, business license suspensions, civil lawsuit and referral to the CCU to collect
any and all debts owed.
By initiating collections in this fashion, instead of waiting months and years to attempt to
collect these debts, it is our evaluation that uninsured employers’ payments will be
recovered in a much quicker and more effective manner and the prior numbers of
delinquent accounts subject to being sent to the CCU for collection will be reduced.
b. In Progress. The UEF met with the CCU on June 7, 2018 regarding all collection issues
as well as a UEF proposal sent to the Department of Budget and Management to initiate a
program of joint jurisdiction over debts between the CCU and the UEF as well as an
established program of contact between the two agencies on a regular basis as regards
debt collection. The CCU also has provided the UEF with a list of assessments owed to
the UEF for which the agency has initiated a process of investigation and collection. The
two agencies have agreed in principle to the parameters laid out in the UEF proposal. The
CCU, however, is in the process of changing over to a new data storage system for its
debts in June and the UEF is, therefore, waiting until July in order to finalize an

--- Page 17 ---
agreement. It is anticipated that this agreement will be in place within the next two
months.
c. Corrected. Done as previously noted and in operation currently.
Claims Processing
Finding 3
UEF did not adequately review indemnity and medical claim payments for propriety.
Recommendation 3
We recommend that UEF
a. conduct independent supervisory reviews of indemnity payments to ensure the
payments are valid and accurate (repeat); and
b. establish a documented procedure to verify, at least on a test basis, that medical claim
payments were proper based on supporting documentation (repeat).
We advised UEF on accomplishing the necessary separation of duties using existing
personnel.
Status of UEF Response to Recommendation 3
a. Corrected. Done. The UEF CFO regularly reviews all claims payments on a weekly basis
submitted by our third-party claims administrator submitted for payment and makes
corrections when required. In addition, the Executive Director randomly reviews
payments to ensure validity and accuracy.
b. Corrected. Done. All medical payments are sent upon receipt to the agency’s third-party
claims administrator’s Bill -Review section where they are reviewed for reasonableness,
correct coding and being customarily correct. Bills are then reviewed by a claims staff
member to insure accuracy, including reviewing to ensure that the injury or treatment
billed matches the injury in the claim. Finally, a random check is performed by the UEF
staff.
Finding 4
UEF violated State procurement regulations to obtain claims processing and related
services from 11 vendors, did not have written agreements with the vendors, and did not
adequately monitor the vendors’ services and verify their billings. During the period from
January 2014 to April 2017, UEF paid these vendors approximately $3.5 million.

--- Page 18 ---
Recommendation 4
We recommend that UEF
a. comply with the procurement and contract provisions of the State procurement
regulations by soliciting competitive bids and executing written contracts for the claims
processing and related services that include all relevant contract provisions (repeat),
b. ensure that invoiced amounts are supported and agree to contract-approved rates and
level of services prior to approving invoices for payment,
c. establish a process for monitoring vendor performance for claims processing and
related functions, and
d. re-submit the emergency contract award to the BPW.
Status of UEF Response to Recommendation 4
a. Corrected. Done. The agency continues to develop a Request for Proposals (RFP) for
third party claims administration services working with the DBM Procurement staff.
b. Corrected. Done. Accomplished as described herein by staff review.
c. Corrected. Done. Accomplished as described herein by UEF staff review. Also monitored
by Executive Director on a regular basis.
d. Corrected. Done. Emergency procurement contract approved by the Board of Public
Works in December, 2017.
Cash Receipts
Finding 5
UEF did not have adequate procedures and controls to ensure that all collections were
deposited.
Recommendation 5
We recommend that UEF ensure that
a. the initial record of collections is forwarded directly to an independent employee to
perform the deposit verification function (repeat),
b. all deposits are made intact,
c. collections are properly safeguarded and are transported directly to the bank for
deposit no later than the next business day,
d. the cash receipts and accounts receivable duties are adequately separated (repeat), and
e. consider the feasibility of using a bank lockbox account to receive collections.
We advised UEF on accomplishing the necessary separation of duties using
existing personnel.

--- Page 19 ---
UEF Response to Recommendation 5
a. Corrected. Done. An employee performs this function and deposits are now reviewed by
the Executive Director or his designee when appropriate.
b. Corrected. Done.
c. Corrected. Done. The UEF plans on initiating remote depositing of checks but the State
has issued an RFP for banking services which should be issued by August, 2018. The
UEF is awaiting the award of this contract in order to initiate scanning and transmission
of deposits with the new bank before changing over to this process.
d. Corrected. Done. A separate employee handles each of these duties now.
e. In Progress. The UEF believes that scanning and remote deposit will, in conjunction with
other polices in place, insure collections are secure. A major concern with the lock-box
concept remains dealing with the absolute requirement that certain relevant information
contained on checks received (including claim number, claimant name, the statement
stubs attached thereto, and other information) must be transmitted to the UEF by the bank
for various critical agency purposes, including accounting and collections requirements,
in order for a lock-box system to be implemented.
Information Systems Security and Control
Finding 6
Sensitive personally identifiable information maintained by UEF was stored without
adequate safeguards.
Recommendation 6
We recommend that UEF properly protect sensitive PII information by encryption or other
substantial mitigating controls.
UEF Response to Recommendation 6
Corrected. Done. This was accomplished, according to our vendor DP Solutions, several months
ago.
Finding 7
Security event monitoring, access controls, and user access monitoring were not sufficient.
Recommendation 7
We recommend that UEF

--- Page 20 ---
a. enable security auditing for files on the dedicated server which hosts UEF’s critical
applications (repeat);
b. generate and review, on a weekly basis, reports of critical security events, document
these reviews, and retain the documentation for future reference (repeat);
c. limit modification access to critical files and programs on the dedicated server to only
those employees who require such access for their job duties (repeat);
d. periodically generate system security reports and use these reports to ensure users
cannot perform incompatible functions and are assigned
only those capabilities needed to perform their job duties (repeat); and
e. prohibit the sharing of userids (repeat).
UEF Response to Recommendation7
Our technical vendor, DP Solutions, has been working with the UEF to comply with these
recommendations. The UEF met with DP Solutions on June 11, 2018 and was updated on the
status of the project. The following is their report of June 25, 2018 to this agency on the
status of that process:
Below are the items we have worked on and how we addressed them. Let me know if you need
more detail.
1. DR Plan—Completed May 7, 2018 and with UEF for review
2. File Access Audit—Complete Audit capture process was put into place on March 1st
2018. The iseries audit journal entries are being captured to a history file each week. Reports
are being created for each journal type.
3. PII Evaluation and Remediation—Complete As of February 7, 2018, all PII’s (ie SSN's) data
has been removed from the UEF AS400. Programs to clear SSN field in all affected files run
nightly to make sure they stay cleared.
4. User Best Practice Document—Completed May 7, 2018 and with UEF for review
5. New User Authorization Form – A form is being developed for adding new users. Type of
users have been identified and "model" user profiles will be set up to facilitate the setup of new
users. Only authorized personnel will be allowed to request user setup/ changes / deletions.
(TBD). We hope to complete July 1, 2018.
6. Documentation and Weekly Review of Access Journals-- An automated process to email
journal reports for review and storage is underway. Spoolmail from Gumbo software has been
installed to create pdf files and email them automatically. We are currently working on how the
review process will work. Essentially, the reports will be emailed to DPS support, so that service
tickets are created and assigned to me. I will review each report and close the tickets with a
comment to indicate reviewed and no action needed. If something needs more attention, that

--- Page 21 ---
will be noted and the appropriate action(s) will be taken. UEF will also be notified and consulted
about any exceptions.
7. Coordination of billing by writing problem to allow download of relevant information
directly into AS400 system—We are currently still working to determine if this is possible. We
have been waiting on information from Corvel for quite a while to determine if this is possible.
a. In Progress.
b. In Progress.
c. In Progress.
d. In Progress.
e. In Progress.
In addition to the information relevant to this Recommendation contained in the above the UEF
advises that it is our position, after consulting with DP Solutions, that the UEF continues to work
to comply with all recommended action items and will be completed all requested achievable
tasks by September 1, 2018.
Finding 8
UEF did not have an information systems disaster recovery plan.
Recommendation 8
We recommend that UEF develop and implement a comprehensive disaster recovery plan,
in accordance with the Information Technology (IT) Disaster Recovery Guidelines (repeat).
UEF Response to Recommendation 8
In Progress. The UEF has a draft produced working with DP Solutions and is reviewing that
draft for final approval. We expect final approval by August 15, 2018.

a. conduct independent supervisory reviews of indemnity payments to ensure the
payments are valid and accurate (repeat); and
b. establish a documented procedure to verify, at least on a test basis, that
medical claim payments were proper based on supporting documentation
(repeat).
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – In Progress
UEF established procedures to address recommendation a, but did not fully
address recommendation b.
For recommendation b, UEF had not established a documented procedure to
verify that medical claim payments were proper based on supporting
documentation. Specifically, although UEF advised us that verifications are
performed on a test basis, it did not document which medical claim payments it
selected for review and did not document the basis for selecting the payments to
verify.
UEF RESPONSE TO PRIOR FINDING 3 DRAFT FOLLOW-UP REVIEW
Recommendation B - The Uninsured Employers’ Fund has established and
implemented the following procedure to verify, on a test basis, the validity of
medical claim payments – all medical payments are sent upon receipt by the
Uninsured Employers’ Fund to the agency’s third-party claims administrator
(TPA), Corvel, under the Emergency Procurement Contract approved by the
Board of Public Works. Corvel’s Bill -Review section receives each bill and each
bill is reviewed for reasonableness, correct coding and being customarily correct
by that unit. Corvel submits a detailed multipage list, numbering in the hundreds,
of each of the bills submitted and the payment, if any, to be made. This document

--- Page 24 ---
is then reviewed by a UEF staff person who randomly takes various claims and
reviews the documentation for accuracy and correct billing.
The Corvel document is also reviewed in detail by the Uninsured Employers’
Fund Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to insure accuracy, including reviewing to
ensure that the injury or treatment billed matches the injury in the claim. Should
the CFO determine any bill requires further research or is questionable, he notifies
Corvel and an investigation takes place.
The review by the CFO is detailed and thorough. It reveals individual bills that
need further investigation and/or explanation from the TPA. The CFO has been
performing this function for a number of months. The review by the TPA, the
UEF staff person’s random review and the complete review by the CFO of the
submission for claims payments provides a complete process of review. The UEF
is has been, and continues, to initiate a process to document in detail all reviews
of medical claim payments conducted pursuant to this finding by the OLA.
Prior Finding 4
UEF violated State procurement regulations to obtain claims processing and
related services from 11 vendors, did not have written agreements with the
vendors, and did not adequately monitor the vendors’ services and verify
their billings. During the period from January 2014 to April 2017, UEF paid
these vendors approximately $3.5 million.
Prior Report Recommendation 4
We recommended that UEF
a. comply with the procurement and contract provisions of the State procurement
regulations by soliciting competitive bids and executing written contracts for
the claims processing and related services that include all relevant contract
provisions (repeat),
b. ensure that invoiced amounts are supported and agree to contract-approved
rates and level of services prior to approving invoices for payment,
c. establish a process for monitoring vendor performance for claims processing
and related functions, and
d. re-submit the emergency contract award to the BPW.
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – No Progress
UEF did not adequately address any of the audit recommendations. Therefore,
virtually no progress was made. UEF is now using only one vendor for claims
processing and related services instead of using multiple vendors. As noted in our
prior finding, UEF entered into an emergency contract with a vendor for claims

--- Page 25 ---
processing and related services for an 18-month term beginning September 1,
2017 at an estimated cost of $994,500 (plus fees).
With regard to recommendation a, UEF did not comply with provisions of the
State procurement regulations with respect to certain additional services procured.
Specifically, beginning in February 2018, UEF began paying the claims
processing vendor a separate fee for services provided by an individual employed
by the vendor who was handling the settlement of claims associated with a large
company’s bankruptcy. While the emergency contract with this vendor included
a provision for additional services, UEF did not enter into a contract modification
with the vendor for these services to reflect agreed-upon terms. Furthermore, the
vendor’s invoices did not specify the hours worked by this individual nor the
number of claims handled to support the work performed. During the period from
February to August 2018, UEF paid $95,550 to the vendor for this individual’s
services.
For recommendation b, we determined that UEF did not ensure invoiced amounts
from the vendor were supported and agreed to contract-approved rates.
Specifically, UEF paid the vendor a fixed monthly fee of $82,875, which is based
on a 12-month contract term, rather than the required $55,250 based on the actual
18-month term. UEF management advised us that it was aware of this
discrepancy, and that it had an informal understanding with the vendor that the
$994,500 estimated cost would be paid over a 12-month period rather than the 18-
month period specified in the contract. UEF management further advised that it
would continue to compensate the vendor at the monthly rate of $82,875 for the
remaining six months of the contract, essentially overpaying the contract by
$497,250. As of August 2018, UEF had paid the vendor approximately $1.1
million, consisting of $994,500 for claims administration fees, $12,000 for other
fees, and $95,550 for the aforementioned individual’s services.
Regarding recommendation c, UEF had not established a process to monitor
vendor performance for claims processing and related functions even though the
contract contains provisions establishing criteria for claims processing and
medical bill review timeliness. For example, the contract requires that medical
bill reviews be completed within five days.
Finally, regarding recommendation d, the aforementioned emergency contract
was initially withdrawn from the Board of Public Works (BPW) agenda before
the meeting date but was re-submitted and approved by BPW on December 20,
2017, as recommended. However, as noted above, UEF was compensating the

--- Page 26 ---
vendor at rates that exceeded the contract terms, and the contract terms presented
to BPW did not reflect this informal arrangement.
UEF RESPONSE TO PRIOR FINDING 4 DRAFT FOLLOW-UP REVIEW
Recommendation A – On October 2, 2018, the UEF, working with the
Department of Management and Budget, issued a Request for Procurement (RFP)
for third party claims administration services. The pre-bid conference was held on
October 18, 2018. According to procurement officials, a schedule has been
established for the RFP which has the contract being awarded by the agency on a
timeline which will result in the RFP being submitted to the Board of Public
Works for approval in February, 2019, which is also in line with the scheduled
termination of the Emergency Procurement Contract.
Recommendation B – The agency emphasizes the following facts – In its 35-year
history the UEF has, apparently, never has had a valid written contract with a
vendor for third party administrative services. Additionally, until September 1,
2017 the UEF had been operating in an illegal fashion without a valid contract
with a third-party administrator which was unable to perform the required
services adequately. This situation came to light after the arrival of the current
Director in late 2016. As a result of these and other relevant facts, the UEF
initiated an Emergency Procurement with Corvel starting on September 1, 2017
for a period of 18 months. Because the agency had failed to keep detailed records,
the Emergency Procurement Contract could not be based on a per claim price for
services because the agency literally had no knowledge of how many claims it
had and was covering. It is difficult to convey to outside parties the extent of the
dysfunction and lack of adequate records existing at the UEF regarding claims
administration when this Emergency Procurement was developed.
The Emergency Procurement Contract was based, therefore, on a flat rate per year
for the 18-month period. Because the UEF had no adequate detailed information
as to the number of claims to be handled or even accurate knowledge of the status
of many claims both parties to the contract realized and acknowledged in the
contract that staffing in the Emergency Contract was subject to revision as facts
developed. The need to investigate and evaluate several hundred claims resulting
from self-insured company bankruptcies resulted in the need to bring on another
Corvel employee to handle these several hundred claims. This was done in
February of 2018. The result of that action has been the identification of claims,
the setting of reserves for claims, the identification of at least one additional
insurance policy of coverage and other critical facts.

--- Page 27 ---
As described above, the Emergency Procurement Contract was agreed at a price
per 12 months of services for a period of 18 months by the parties. The intent of
that agreement is expressed within that contract, which was approved by the
Board of Public Works. It was the clear intent of the parties. The amount paid
pursuant to the Emergency Procurement by the UEF is correct per the agreement
of the parties and the intent of the contract.
The agency does not agree with the Office of Legislative Audits conclusions as
regards this matter regarding the Emergency Procurement but is always ready to
cure any minor, technical matter that may be involved as to this issue and staff is
currently working with DBM to produce formal contract modifications to be
submitted to the Board of Public Works that should address the issues raised by
the OLA regarding the Emergency Procurement Contract for TPA services.
Cash Receipts
Prior Finding 5
UEF did not have adequate procedures and controls to ensure that all
collections were deposited.
Prior Report Recommendation 5
We recommended that UEF
a. ensure that the initial record of collections is forwarded directly to an
independent employee to perform the deposit verification function (repeat),
b. ensure that all deposits are made intact,
c. ensure that collections are properly safeguarded and are transported directly to
the bank for deposit no later than the next business day,
d. ensure that the cash receipts and accounts receivable duties are adequately
separated (repeat), and
e. consider the feasibility of using a bank lockbox account to receive collections.
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – In Progress
UEF had established adequate procedures and controls to address
recommendations b and c and adequately addressed recommendation e.
However, UEF did not fully address recommendations a and d.
For recommendation a, the initial record of collections (an adding machine tape)
was not forwarded directly to the employee responsible for independently
verifying that all collections had been deposited. Instead, the initial record and
related collections were forwarded to two employees responsible for preparing the
bank deposits, recording the deposits in the State's accounting records, and

--- Page 28 ---
depositing the collections at the bank. Furthermore, the employee responsible for
verifying that all collections had been deposited was not independent as this
employee had access to the safe where collections were stored overnight.
For recommendation d, the responsibilities for the cash receipts and accounts
receivable functions were not separated since three employees involved in the
collection process had the capabilities to record the collections and any
adjustments in the related automated accounts receivable records.
UEF RESPONSE TO PRIOR FINDING 5 DRAFT FOLLOW-UP REVIEW
Recommendations A and D – The Uninsured Employers’ Fund continues to work
to implement these suggestions to the satisfaction of the Office of Legislative
Audits.
Information Systems Security and Control
Prior Finding 8
UEF did not have an information systems disaster recovery plan.
Prior Report Recommendation 8
We recommended that UEF develop and implement a comprehensive disaster
recovery plan, in accordance with the Information Technology (IT) Disaster
Recovery Guidelines (repeat).
Auditor’s Assessment of Status – In Progress
UEF had not completely addressed the recommendation for development and
implementation of a disaster recovery plan (DRP). UEF, working together with
its information technology support vendor, had developed a draft DRP document,
which was currently under management review. We examined the draft DRP
document and determined that sections existed for recommended key plan
elements such as concept of operations, notification and activation procedures,
recovery strategies (including use of alternate sites) and reconstitution procedures.
However, for these same plan elements, the plan lacked detailed content
describing specific steps, information, and other materials necessary for a
complete DRP, which could be both tested and executed if necessary.
