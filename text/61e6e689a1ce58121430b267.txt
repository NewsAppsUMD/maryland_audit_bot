Legislative Requests and Hotline Allegations
 In June 2020, the chairs of the Senate Education, Health, and
Environmental Affairs and the House Health and Government Operations
Committees requested that the Office of Legislative Audits conduct a review
of the emergency procurements awarded to LabGenomics for COVID test
kits and Blue Flame Medical, LLC for medical supplies.
 We also reviewed the termination of one employee associated with the
LabGenomics tests that was identified in an allegation received through our
fraud, waste, and abuse hotline and another employee noted by the Joint
Audit and Evaluation Committee.
 Finally, we reviewed concerns raised in the aforementioned allegation
regarding the accuracy of test results for samples collected at Towson
University that were reported by the University of Maryland Pathology
Associates (UMPA) laboratory when using a second set of test kits obtained
from LabGenomics.

Initial Review
 We conducted our initial review from September 11, 2020 through January
29, 2021 and issued our report on March 31, 2021 which noted the
following:
 The test kits were not procured in accordance with State procurement
regulations, and the absence of documentation to support critical
decisions regarding the procurement, cost, and validity of the tests.
 The justification for the termination of the employees was not supported.
 We were unable to account for and corroborate the concerns with the
reliability of test results since our requests for these records were initially
denied and access was not provided with sufficient time to be included in
our initial report.
 During our review we identified numerous other COVID related emergency
procurements procured and monitored by various State agencies.

Current Review
Due to difficulties and delays in obtaining documentation, and the identification
of numerous other COVID emergency procurements, we decided to include the
review of the Blue Flame Medical, LLC procurement as part of a separate
broader review of COVID emergency procurements during which we would also
review the information received on the use and reliability of the test results.
Accordingly, the objectives of our current review were to:
1. Assess the procurement and accountability of certain emergency
procurements associated with the State’s COVID-19 response; and
2. Account for the number of LabGenomics test kits used and corroborate the
allegation regarding concerns with the accuracy of test results received for
samples collected at Towson University.

Current Review
 Our current review identified 848 emergency procurements totaling $1.7
billion related to the State of Maryland’s COVID-19 response. These
emergency procurements were conducted by 19 State agencies during
the period between March 2020 and May 2021.
 We reviewed 15 of these procurements including the Blue Flame Medical,
LLC purchase and 14 other emergency procurements totaling $232.8
million conducted by the following 6 agencies:
 Department of General Services (DGS)
 Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS)

Emergency Procurement Overview
 State procurement regulations authorize agencies to procure goods and
services using the emergency procurement method when faced with an
emergency. An emergency is defined in regulation as “a sudden and
unexpected occurrence or condition which agency management reasonably
could not foresee that requires an action to avoid or to mitigate serious
damage to public health, safety, or welfare.”
 State procurement regulations include several requirements for emergency
procurements, including:
 a formal written contract;
 obtaining as much competition as practicable;
 notifying the Board of Public Works (BPW) of the procurement;
 publicizing the award on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA); and
 documenting the details of the procurement, including justification for the
use of the emergency procurement and the basis for selecting the vendor.

Objective 1 – Summary of Results
In general, our review noted a lack of compliance with State regulations for
emergency procurements and ineffective monitoring of the related payments.
In addition, documentation was frequently not available to support that items
purchased were inspected and the items’ disposition.
 Eleven emergency procurements (valued at $189.4 million) were not in
compliance with one or more State procurement regulations. For example,
three procurements lacked formal contracts and the contracts for eight
procurements did not include all required provisions.
 Seven emergency procurements with payments at the time of our review
totaling $133.7 million were not effectively monitored. For example, the
responsible agencies could not document that the services were received
and that the payments were in accordance with the contracts for four
procurements with $25.5 million in payments.

Objective 1 – Summary of Results (continued)
 In general, documentation was not provided to support that personal
protective equipment (PPE) items purchased were inspected to ensure the
items provided met applicable requirements. Although the agencies that
received the items advised that the items were visually inspected to ensure
the items were undamaged, the agencies could not document any additional
steps taken to verify that the items were legitimate (for example, that face
masks met the technical specifications of an N95 or KN95 mask).
 We could not determine the disposition of certain items valued at
approximately $7.6 million purchased under five emergency procurements.
For example, MDH lacked documentation that it received 2 million KN95
face masks for which it paid $3,280,000.

Objective 1 – Selected Findings: Blue Flame Medical, LLC
Background
 April 2020 - DGS issued a purchase order, on behalf of MDH, to Blue Flame
Medical, LLC for 1.55 million N95 masks and 110 ventilators. The total cost
was $12.5 million, of which DGS paid $6.3 as an initial deposit.
 May 2020 - DGS cancelled the purchase and attempted to recover the
deposit due to the vendor’s failure to deliver any items within the expected
time frame.
 October 2020 – DGS entered into a settlement with the vendor which allowed
Blue Flame Medical, LLC to keep the initial deposit as payment for the 1.55
million N95 masks and 37 ventilators that it ultimately provided to MDH.

Objective 1 – Selected Findings: Blue Flame Medical, LLC (cont.)
OLA Findings
 DGS did not procure the Blue Flame Medical, LLC contract in accordance with
State procurement regulations. For example, the purchase order did not
contain certain critical provisions such as dispute resolution, delays and
extensions, conformance of specifications, and delivery and acceptance.
The omission of these provisions was significant given that litigation was
ultimately required to obtain certain items purchased from the vendor.
 Although MDH inspected the ventilators, it could not provide documentation
to support that the N95 masks were inspected to ensure they met applicable
requirements.
 During our physical inventory of its warehouse in July 2021, MDH could not
locate 475,400 N95 masks with an associated purchase price of $2.1
million. MDH advised that the unaccounted for masks had been distributed,
but that MDH’s inventory records had not been updated to reflect these
distributions.

Objective 1 – Selected Findings: Ernst & Young, LLC
Background
 In January 2021, MDH awarded $3.8 million contract to Ernst & Young, LLC
(EY) for consulting services related to the State’s COVID-19 Vaccination
Program. EY was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the Program to
identify any additional support, processes, and actions necessary for MDH to
effectively administer the program. EY was also to provide seven staff to
support the Program, with the provision that additional staff would be
provided on an as needed basis to implement the recommendations
contained in the comprehensive assessment.
 MDH processed a contract modification in April 2021 that increased the
contract cost to $25.0 million. Subsequent to our field work, MDH processed
a second modification (valued at $22.0 million), increasing the total contract
cost to $47.0 million and extending the contract term through June 30,
2022.

Objective 1 – Selected Findings: Ernst & Young, LLC (cont.)
OLA Findings
MDH did not procure the contract in accordance with State regulations. For
example:
 The use of the emergency procurement method did not appear justified
because MDH was aware it needed the services three months before it
procured the services.
 The comprehensive assessment provided by EY did not identify specific
actions necessary to implement the recommendations and the additional EY
staff needed to conduct the work, as required by the contract.
 MDH could not explain the rationale for a $21.3 million contract modification
processed in April 2021, which did not identify the additional services to be
provided.
 MDH could not document that it approved the EY employees billed, and did
not obtain documentation of the work completed by each employee, as
required by the contract. We could not verify the propriety of the billings,
which totaled $3.7 million at the time of our review.

Objective 2 – Disposition and Reliability of LabGenomics Tests
We obtained and analyzed documentation of test results from the laboratories
that used the second set of 500,000 COVID-19 tests purchased from
LabGenomics that were the subject of our Review of Procurement of Certain
COVID Tests report (dated March 31, 2021).
 Our analysis disclosed that 460,596 (92 percent) of the 500,000
LabGenomics tests were used to analyze patient samples.
 We generally corroborated the concerns raised in an allegation made to our
fraud, waste, and abuse hotline in September 2020 regarding the accuracy
of certain test results received for samples collected. We determined that 42
of the 66 individuals identified in the allegation who initially tested positive,
were retested from 2 to 6 days after the initial tests were completed and
that 26 of these individuals received a negative result on their subsequent
test. However, we could not determine the cause of the different results.

Conclusions
While we recognize the urgent and unique circumstances under which these
procurements were made, such conditions would not mitigate the need to:
 Properly document and comply with State regulations specifically tailored to
or required of emergency procurements;
 Ensure that purchased goods and services were received and met applicable
requirements; and
 Document the disposition of items purchased.
