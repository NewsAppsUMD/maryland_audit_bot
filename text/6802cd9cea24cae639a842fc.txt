Dear Senator Guzzone and Delegate Barnes:
The Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by the
Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) to resolve the 5 repeat audit findings (that
were addressed by 11 recommendations) in our June 24, 2021 audit report. This review was
conducted in accordance with a requirement specified in the April 2024 Joint Chairmen’s
Report (JCR), page 201. The JCR required that, prior to the release of $250,000 of its
administrative appropriation for fiscal year 2025, MHEC must take corrective action on all
repeat audit findings on or before November 1, 2024.
The JCR language further provided that OLA submit a report to the budget committees
listing each repeat audit finding along with a determination that each finding was corrected.
The OLA report is required to be submitted to allow 45 days for the budget committees to
review and release the funds prior to the end of the fiscal year. Certain detailed information
and exhibits have been deemed cybersecurity related and therefore have been redacted in
accordance with the State Government Article Section 2-1224(i), of the Annotated Code of
Maryland.
In accordance with the April 2024 JCR requirement, MHEC provided a status report to
OLA, dated November 1, 2024, detailing certain corrective actions that had been completed
and actions that were ongoing with respect to all five repeat audit findings (Exhibit 1). The
MHEC status report indicated that corrective action was in progress for at least some of the
recommendations for the non-cybersecurity-related findings.
In accordance with State law, the status of the cybersecurity-related findings has been
redacted.
