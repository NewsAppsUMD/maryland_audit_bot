REPORTS FOR WHICH COMMITTEE ACTION IS RECOMMENDED
SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
OCTOBER 1, 2008 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2008
1) Department of Human Resources – Social Services Administration (SSA) (10/6/08 – 26
pages – 9 findings)
• SSA has not been able to successfully implement several critical components of the
Children’s Electronic Social Services Information Exchange (CHESSIE) system and has
not been able to ensure data entered into the system were accurate and complete.
These problems affected SSA’s ability to conduct effective programmatic and financial
monitoring and hindered preparation of accurate reports to the federal government.
Development costs for CHESSIE totaled $67.6 million through June 30, 2007.
• SSA had not ensured compliance with critical foster care service requirements
established by State and federal regulations. The system used to monitor compliance
with State regulations was discontinued, and SSA had not met the required federal child
welfare outcomes.
• SSA was unable to adequately monitor the sufficiency of the child welfare caseload
ratios of the local departments of social services, as required by State law.
• A reliable and accurate single registry source of information about individuals known to
be guilty of child abuse or neglect, or found responsible for indicated abuse or neglect,
did not exist.
• SSA did not ensure that all available federal funds were obtained for certain services
provided to eligible foster care children.
• SSA did not monitor local department caseworkers to ensure foster care children were
placed with preferred group providers which, when available, generally had lower rates
than non-preferred providers.
• Timely reviews of group care provider annual reports for fiscal years 2005 and 2006
were not conducted to identify overpayments.
Recommended Committee Action – None at this time since the report was previously
discussed at the Committee’s October 2008 meeting.

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
OCTOBER 1, 2008 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2008
2) Department of Human Resources – Child Support Enforcement Administration (CSEA)
(10/7/08 – 26 pages – 15 findings)
• CSEA did not use occupational license suspension as an enforcement tool for
delinquent child support obligors. A match of CSEA obligors to 16 licensing units
identified 5,283 individuals with occupational licenses that owed child support payments
totaling $47 million.
• Comprehensive procedures were not in place to ensure valid social security numbers
were on file for each obligor to facilitate the collection of unpaid child support.
• CSEA did not fully use available automated techniques to identify and seize certain
obligor bank accounts to satisfy unpaid child support balances. For example, effective
July 2005, CSEA ceased identifying obligor bank accounts in Maryland-chartered
financial institutions.
• Driver’s license suspension referrals rejected by the Motor Vehicle Administration due to
system edits were not adequately investigated.
• CSEA did not have effective procedures to detect child support payments that were
issued to deceased individuals, who were generally custodial parents. A data match
disclosed payments totaling $331,972 during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to 576
deceased individuals 30 days or more after the payee’s date of death.
• CSEA did not forward certain undisbursed funds to the Comptroller of the Treasury as
required by State law. As of August 2007, CSEA was holding $1.1 million in
undisbursed funds that had been collected over four years ago.
• CSEA transferred $2.4 million from a local child support office bank account and
retained these funds in its central disbursement account without determining the proper
distribution.
Recommended Committee Action – None at this time since the report was previously
discussed at the Committee’s October 2008 meeting.

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
OCTOBER 1, 2008 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2008
3) Department of Transportation – Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) (11/5/08 – 20
pages – 9 findings)
• MTA did not adequately safeguard and account for keys to certain fare revenue
equipment. In January 2008, MTA referred to the Office of the Attorney General –
Criminal Division a matter regarding an unauthorized employee who used such keys to
improperly access certain fare box collections.
• MTA did not use reports produced by its automated bus fare box system to ensure that
recorded fare collections were subsequently deposited in the bank. Using available
system reports, we identified differences between recorded collections and amounts
deposited totaling approximately $475,000 for the period from March 2007 to June
2007.
• Preventive maintenance inspections of its transit buses were not performed timely in
accordance with federal requirements and MTA’s bus inspection plan.
• MTA made a grant payment totaling approximately $433,000 in violation of the related
grant agreement.
• Internal control deficiencies were noted with respect to information systems security,
materials and supplies, and equipment. Specifically, access to critical payroll systems
was not properly restricted, appropriate accountability was not established for certain
materials and supplies, and a physical inventory of equipment had not been completed
for a number of years.
• MTA’s motor vehicle fleet was significantly underutilized.

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
OCTOBER 1, 2008 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2008
4) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Spring Grove Hospital Center (SGHC) –
Possible Improper Procurement Activities (Special – Fraud) (11/10/08 – 15 pages – 4
findings)
Based on allegations received through its fraud hotline, OLA conducted a review regarding
possible improper procurement activities related to certain maintenance projects by the
Spring Grove Hospital Center (SGHC), a unit of the Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene. OLA’s review of SGHC records indicated that the allegations related primarily to
maintenance projects that were individually less than $25,000. Projects under that amount do
not require outside control agency approvals, such as the Department of General Services.
The review identified the following:
• There were questionable transactions totaling $167,106 involving one contractor. The
bidding processes for numerous projects awarded to this contractor appeared to have
been significantly compromised. Specifically, competing bids were purportedly
submitted by two or three contractors but all of the bids were, in actuality, faxed to
SGHC by the winning low bidder. In other instances, faxed bid documents had been
tampered with to eliminate references as to where the bids had originated.
• Projects were often awarded to this contractor either without using a competitive bid
process or as sole source procurements for repairs that appeared to be routine in
nature.
• SGHC directed maintenance projects totaling $232,000 to three other contractors during
the period when these contractors employed a certain individual. The projects were
generally awarded without using a competitive bid process and involved other
questionable procurement practices, such as awarding projects as sole source
procurements without any written justification.
• Personal relationships existed between certain SGHC employees and contractors.
These relationships and related transactions may have violated State Ethics Laws and a
related Governor’s Executive Order.

SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS
OCTOBER 1, 2008 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2008
5) Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED) (11/10/08 – 24 pages – 11
findings)
• DBED did not always obtain adequate documentation to verify eligibility for income tax
credits it approved, such as to businesses for creating a specified number of new jobs in
Maryland. In one case, a $50,000 credit was approved for a corporation that did not
meet the applicable eligibility criteria.
• Controls over the issuance of sales tax exemption certificates to film production
companies were not sufficient. During fiscal years 2005 through 2007, 215 applicants
were certified for tax credits under various programs and 273 sales tax exemption
certificates were issued.
• DBED did not effectively verify employment data submitted by recipients of loans under
the Economic Development Opportunities Program Fund and the Maryland Economic
Development Assistance Authority and Fund. The accuracy of these data is critical
since loan agreements often provide for forgiveness of all or a portion of the loan if a
certain number of jobs are retained and/or created. Loan amounts totaling
approximately $27.6 million were forgiven during fiscal years 2005 through 2007.
• DBED did not always enforce contract and grant reporting requirements related to
certain financing programs, its international offices, and the development of tourism and
economic development in Maryland. For example, activity reports and audited financial
statements were not always obtained.
• Certain expenditures tested were not adequately supported or made in accordance with
contract terms. In addition, controls over certain purchasing transactions and State
checks received directly by DBED for distribution to payees need to be improved.
• The effectiveness of certain promotional and marketing events, costing approximately
$184,000, was not adequately evaluated or documented.
• DBED made payment to certain employees by allowing them to remain on the payroll
for extended periods after their termination dates with no specific assigned
responsibilities.
