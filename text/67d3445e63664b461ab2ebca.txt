Re: Audit of the Comptroller of Maryland –
Revenue Administration Division
The Honorable Brooke E. Lierman, Esq., Comptroller
Comptroller of Maryland
Goldstein Treasury Building
80 Calvert Street
Annapolis, Maryland 21404
Dear Comptroller Lierman:
We received your request for a 12-month delay of our upcoming audit of the Comptroller
of Maryland – Revenue Administration Division (COM-RAD) due to the ongoing
implementation of several Major Information Technology Development Projects (MITDPs). To
that end, we requested an implementation status for the 9 findings included in our most recent
report of COM-RAD. In response to our request, your Office provided a status report, as of
March 6, 2025, which indicated that COM-RAD had fully addressed 8 of the 9 report findings
and the remaining finding was in progress.
Based on the circumstances and the reported status of the prior findings, your request for
a 12-month delay of the COM-RAD audit has been approved.
Sincerely,
Brian S. Tanen
