Discussion of Audit Results
The primary factors contributing to our inability to
certify nine measures were:
(cid:190)Documentation was not available to support the
reported results.
(cid:190)For data used in calculating the measure,
procedures and controls were not adequate to
ensure supporting agency or third party data was
complete, accurate and reliable.
(cid:190)Reported results were not consistent with the
performance measure descriptions and
definitions.
The applicable agencies generally agreed with our
conclusions and have indicated that any necessary
corrective actions will be taken.

Conclusion
These audit results indicate that:
(cid:190)Agency MFR staff need to become more familiar
with DBM requirements for documentation and
controls for MFR data.
(cid:190)More active involvement of agency Internal
Auditors and Inspector Generals may help
address reliability issues.
(cid:190)Executive management commitment to the MFR
process should help improve the reliability and
usefulness of the measures.
