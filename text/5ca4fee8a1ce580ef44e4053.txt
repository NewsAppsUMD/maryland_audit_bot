Dear Senator King and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by the State
Department ofAssessments and Taxation (DAT) to resolve the repeat findings in our February 22,
2018 audit report. This review was conducted in accordance with a requirement specified in the
April 2018 Joint Chairmen‘s Report (JCR), page 32. The JCR required that, prior to the release
of $100,000 of its administrative appropriation for fiscal year 2019, DAT must take corrective
action with respectto all repeat audit findings on or before November 1, 2018. The JCR language
further provided that OLA submit a report to the budget committees listing each repeat audit
finding along with a determination that each finding was corrected. The OLA report is required
to be submitted to allow 45 days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior
to the end ofthe fiscal year.
The February 22, 2018 audit report ofDAT contained six repeat audit findings (Findings
3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10) that were addressed by ten recommendations. In accordance with the April
2018 JCR requirement, DAT provided a report to OLA, dated November 1, 2018, detailing the
corrective actions that it had taken with respect to the repeat audit findings (Exhibit 1). The DAT
status report indicated that corrective actions had been completed to address the recommendations
for findings 3, 5, 7, $ and 10, and that corrective actions were ongoing for repeat
recommendations from finding 6. DAT’s status report also addressed certain recommendations
that were not applicable to repeat findings; and consequently we did not assess the corrective
actions taken for these recommendations.

Senator Nancy J. King, Chair
Delegate Maggie McIntosh, Chair -2- April 1, 2019
We reviewedthe DAT status report and relateddocumentation, performed limitedtests and
analyses ofthe information, and held discussion with DAT personnel as necessary to assess the
implementation status of the related recommendations. Our review did not constitute an audit
conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Based on our
review, we determined that DAT had resolved findings 3, 5, 7, and 8, but not taken sufficient
actions to correct repeat findings 6 and 10 (Exhibit 2). Our assessment ofthe two repeat findings
that had not been resolved is included in Exhibit 3.
Afier discussing our review results, DAT generally agreed with the accuracy of the
informationpresented. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the review
by DAT and its willingness to address the audit issues and implement appropriate corrective
actions.
We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the JCR requirement. Please contact me if
you need additional information.
Sincerely,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA

Status of Repeat Findings in OLA’s February 22, 2018 Audit Report on the
State Department ofAssessments and Taxation (DAT)
Status Based on
Prior Recommendations Pertaining to Repeat Findings
OLA Review
Real Property Assessments
3. We recommend that DAT enhance procedures by requiring each
local assessment office to Resolved
a. establish initial accountability and control over all property-
related documents manually received from local
governments, including deeds and permits.
b. resolve building permit processing errors and ensure the
permits are subsequently recorded Resolved
c. ensure that building permit data, property tax exemption
transactions, and real property appeal decisions are
properly recorded in the Assessment and Administration Resolved
Valuation System (AAVS) based on supervisory review of
supporting documentation, and that these verifications are
documented.
Homestead Property Tax Credit (HPTC)
5. We recommend that DAT
a. perform an analysis ofpersonnel and resource funding Resolved
requirements and develop a comprehensive compliance
program to help ensure that HPTCs are only granted for
eligible properties.
b. review reports ofpotentially ineligible accounts, including Resolved
those noted in the finding, and take appropriate corrective
action.
Homeowners’ Tax Credit (HTC)
6. We recommend that DAT Not Resolved
a. perform timely audits ofHTC applications.
d. ensure localjurisdictions submit monthly files ofredeemed
HTCs, review differences between the amounts of Not Resolved
redeemed HTCs and those authorized by DAT, and use the
files to verify the propriety ofreimbursement requests.
Information Systems Security and Control
7. We recommend that DAT
a. log all critical database security and audit related events, Resolved
regularly generate reports ofthese logged events, review
these reports on a timely basis, document these reviews,
and retain the documentation for future reference.

Prior Recommendations Pertaining to Repeat Findings
OLA Review
Information Systems Security and Control
8. We recommend that DAT, in conjunction with the Department
ofInformation Technology (DolT), Resolved
a. perform a documented review and assessment ofDAT
network security risks and identify how intrusion detection
prevention systems (IDPS) coverage should be best applied
to the DAT network to include IDP$ coverage to all
inbound untrusted traffic.
Cash Receipts
10. We recommend that DAT Not Resolved
b. perform independent and proper deposit verifications,
including using the original record ofchecks received.

Exhibit 3 to April 1, 2019 Letter to Joint Chairmen
OLA’s Assessments Regarding Repeat Findings That Were Not Resolved
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 6
—
We recommend that DAT
a. perform timely audits ofHTC applications (repeat), and
d. ensure local jurisdictions submit monthly files of redeemed HTCs, review differences
between the amounts ofredeemed HTCs and those authorized by DAT, and use the files
to verify the propriety of reimbursement requests (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Our review disclosed that although DAT made some progress in auditing the HTC applications,
there was still a significant backlog. Specifically, at the time ofour review, DAT had completed
audits for the applications received from homeowners who were granted tax credits in 2012 and
2014, but audits ofapplications for tax credits granted in 2015 and 2016 were not completed.
DAT management advised us that no audits were conducted ofapplications for tax credits
granted in 2013 because many were duplicates ofthe 2012 applications and DAT did not believe
it was an efficient use ofresources.
For the monthly files ofredeemed HTCs, our review ofthe files received by DAT for October
2018 disclosed that 6 ofthe 24 localjurisdictions failed to submit the monthly files. In addition,
although DAT used the files received from 18 localjurisdictions to review differences between
the amount ofredeemed HTCs and those it had authorized, they did not use them to verify the
propriety ofthejurisdictions’ reimbursement requests.
Prior Report Recommendation Finding 10
We recommend that DAT
b. perform independent and proper deposit verifications, including using the original
record of checks received (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
Although verifications for lockbox and ACH collections, which are the source for the majority of
personal property return filing fee collections, were being properly performed, the process for the
verification ofcollections received at DAT headquarters was insufficient. Specifically, the
independent employee performing the verification did not use the original record ofcash and
checks received as recommended.
