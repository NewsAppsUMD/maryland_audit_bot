Annapolis, Maryland
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland State Department
of Education (MSDE) for the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending May
31, 2021. MSDE is responsible for setting statewide goals for school
performance, monitoring school achievement, and distributing financial aid.
MSDE also operates educational programs in the State’s juvenile services
facilities, and provides services to people with disabilities.
Our audit disclosed that MSDE did not ensure that Blueprint for Maryland’s
Future (Blueprint) funds provided to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) were used
in accordance with the purposes established by State law. Specifically, MSDE
did not obtain documentation of actual LEA expenditures and compare this
documentation to the related application to ensure the LEAs used the funds in
accordance with the purposes established by State law.
In addition, in order to establish increased accountability, we believe that MSDE
should establish a monitoring process to ensure LEAs implemented appropriate
corrective actions to address findings from our Office’s financial management
practices audit reports. Our most recent audit reports of the 24 LEAs identified
318 findings, including 171 findings repeated from the preceding audit. Our
review disclosed that although MSDE can obtain copies of the LEA audit reports,
it did not require the LEAs to periodically report on the status of corrective
actions. Consequently, MSDE lacked assurance that audit findings were

--- Page 4 ---
appropriately addressed to ensure policies, procedures, and controls were
effective in accounting for and safeguarding LEA assets, and provided for the
efficient use of financial resources.
Furthermore, we determined that MSDE’s audits of LEA enrollment data could be
more effective if it used a risk-based approach to determine which enrollment
records to test, reviewed controls over the LEA’s processes to record student
attendance, and conducted a comprehensive review to determine if errors noted
during its audits were the result of potential systemic issues requiring corrective
action at the LEAs. Improving the enrollment audit processes is important since
State funding to the LEAs is primarily based on enrollment counts.
Additionally, we noted deficiencies with MSDE’s security and control over its
information systems and network. However in accordance with the State
Government Article, Section 2-1224(i) of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we
have redacted these findings from this audit report. Specifically, State law
requires the Office of Legislative Audits to redact cybersecurity findings in a
manner consistent with auditing best practices before the report is made available
to the public. The term “cybersecurity” is defined in the State Finance and
Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b), and using our professional judgment we
have determined that the redacted findings fall under the referenced definition.
The specifics of the cybersecurity findings were previously communicated to
MSDE as well as those parties responsible for acting on our recommendations.
Finally, we noted a lack of verification of data related to certain grants and certain
contract procurement and monitoring deficiencies.
Based on our current audit assessment of significance and risk to our audit
objectives, our audit included a review to determine the status of seven of the
eight findings contained in our preceding audit report. For the three non-
cybersecurity findings, we determined that MSDE satisfactorily addressed two of
those findings. The remaining finding is repeated in this report.
MSDE’s response to this audit is included as an appendix to this report. We
reviewed the response to our findings and related recommendations, and have
concluded that the corrective actions identified are sufficient to address all audit
issues. While MSDE generally agrees with the recommendations in this report,
we identified certain statements in the response requiring an “auditor’s comment”
to further explain our position. In accordance with our policy, we have edited any
vendor names or products mentioned by MSDE in this document. Consistent
with the requirements of State law, we have redacted the elements of MSDE’s
response related to cybersecurity audit findings.

We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us during the audit by
MSDE and its willingness to address the audit issues and implement appropriate
corrective actions.

Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), as the staff agency of the
State Board of Education, supports the development and operation of educational
programs throughout the State. MSDE is responsible for setting Statewide goals
for school performance, monitoring school achievement, and distributing financial
aid. MSDE also operates educational programs in the State’s juvenile services
facilities, and provides services to people with disabilities. MSDE consists of the
Headquarters and nine units or divisions. This audit report includes the
operations of the following four units or divisions.
 Headquarters – Centralized business services including procurement,
accounts payable, corporate purchasing cards, grants management, human
resources, payroll, internal audits, and the Division of Rehabilitation Services
 Aid to Education – Formula funding grants and grants for the Blueprint for
Maryland’s Future for local education agencies
 Funding for Educational Organizations – Grants to the Maryland School
for the Blind, Blind Industries and Services of Maryland, and other
educational institutions (such as museums and theaters)
 Children’s Cabinet Interagency Fund – The Fund’s purpose is to ensure the
effective, efficient and comprehensive delivery of services to Maryland’s
children and families by coordinating the programs and policies of the State
child-serving agencies.
The remaining six units or divisions of MSDE (Division of Early Childhood
Development (including child care scholarship program), Maryland Longitudinal
Data System Center, Interagency Commission on School Construction, Maryland
Center for School Safety, Office of the Inspector General for Education, and the
Accountability and Implementation Board) are included within the scope of, and
reported upon, in separate audits.1 The support services these units or divisions
receive from MSDE Headquarters are subject to review and testing during this
audit.
1 According to State law, the Maryland Center for School Safety was reformed as an independent
unit within MSDE effective June 2018. The Center was originally established in July 2013 as an
independent unit and budgeted within the Department of State Police where it was subject to our
audit. Additionally, according to State law, the Office of the Inspector General for Education
was established as in independent unit of State government effective June 2019, and the
Accountability and Implementation Board was authorized as an independent unit of State
government effective February 2021. Our Office will be auditing these three units separately in
the future.

--- Page 10 ---
According to the State’s records, during fiscal year 2021 MSDE’s operating
expenditures totaled approximately $9.8 billion, of which $9.4 billion related to
the four units or divisions audited. This includes approximately $9.2 billion in
Aid to Education, of which $6.3 billion are grants awarded to local education
agencies. The remaining $2.9 billion are comprised of payments for education
related costs such as the employers’ share of retirement costs for local school
system employees, and certain innovative programs.
As noted in Figure 1, Aid to Education expenditures increased $2.2 billion since
fiscal year 2016. The significant increase in Aid to Education expenditures from
fiscal year 2019 to 2021 was primarily attributed to federal funds to address the
COVID-19 pandemic health crisis and State funds for the Blueprint for
Maryland’s Future grants. During the period from fiscal year 2016 to 2019
student enrollment slightly increased, but significantly decreased in fiscal year
2020. MSDE advised us that the decrease in enrollment was primarily attributed
to the COVID-19 pandemic health crisis when parents and guardians chose to
either homeschool or enroll students in private schools.

Resource Sharing Agreements Audit
On August 3, 2018, we issued a performance report on Telecommunication
Resource Sharing Agreements (RSAs) to evaluate the State’s use and oversight of
telecommunications resource sharing agreements between multiple State agencies
(including MSDE) and private companies. This report included a number of
findings related to selected agencies, but emphasized the need for the Department
of Information Technology to exercise greater oversight of resource sharing
agreements. The performance audit included the following two findings related to
MSDE.
 MSDE did not deposit RSA funds into the State’s Major Information
Technology Development Project (MITDP) fund as required at the time of the
audit.2
 MSDE did not always include adequate provisions in its RSAs to protect State
interests.
MSDE generally agreed to the findings and recommendations in the August 2018
report.
State Grants Audit
On November 10, 2021, we issued a performance report on State Grants to assess
the State’s policies and guidance for advertising, awarding, and monitoring State-
funded grants. The report contained two findings related to MSDE.
 The State did not have standardized grant applications and grant agreements.
As a result, certain agencies (including MSDE) did not include critical
provisions in grant agreements. Specifically, MSDE’s grant agreements
lacked eight of the nine critical provisions (such as, conflict of interest, sub-
grantee requirements, political contribution disclosures, and termination for
default or convenience).
 MSDE made advanced payments totaling $182,000 on a fiscal year 2020 and
2021 grant when the related grant agreements only allowed for payments on a
2 As a result of the performance audit, the Office of the Attorney General provided an advice
which concluded that since the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) did not properly
identify MSDE’s two agreements as RSAs, the compensation received from the agreements did
not have to be deposited into the State’s MITDP fund. The advice also concluded that any future
MSDE agreements should be submitted to DoIT for review and approval and compensation
should be deposited into the MITDP Fund.

reimbursable basis. We did not review these grants during our current audit,
but noted issues with other grants for which MSDE did not verify the
accuracy of grantee expenditure and performance data and did not perform
site visits.
MSDE generally agreed to the finding and related recommendation regarding the
advanced grant payment. For the finding regarding the standardized grant
applications and grant agreements, we did not specifically recommend MSDE to
revise its grant application or grant agreements. Instead, we recommended that
the Governor’s Grants Office (GGO) and the Department of Budget and
Management (DBM), under the direction of the Maryland Efficient Grant
Application Council, work to develop a uniform grant application and agreement
that incorporates critical mandatory provisions and requires State agencies to use
these documents. Both GGO and DBM agreed with the finding and related
recommendation.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Based on our current assessment of significance and risk relative to our audit
objectives, our audit included a review to determine the status of seven of the
eight findings contained in our preceding audit report dated July 2, 2019. As
disclosed in Figure 2, for the three non-cybersecurity-related findings, we
determined that MSDE satisfactorily addressed two of those findings. The
remaining finding is repeated in this report.

Findings and Recommendations
Oversight and Monitoring of Local Education Agencies
Background - Blueprint for Maryland’s Future
The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future (Blueprint) is a State funded grant program
based on recommendations of the Maryland Commission on Innovation and
Excellence in Education (Commission). The Commission was established by
Chapters 701 and 702, Laws of Maryland 2016, effective June 1, 2016 to review
the adequacy of funding for education. Chapter 771, Laws of Maryland, 2019,
effective June 1, 2019, established principles of the Blueprint that are intended to

Finding 1
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) did not ensure LEAs
used Blueprint for Maryland’s Future funds in accordance with the purposes
established by State law.
Analysis
MSDE did not ensure LEAs used Blueprint funds in accordance with the purposes
established by State law. Each LEA was required to submit an application for
Blueprint funding that included a detailed budget on how the funds were to be
used in accordance with the purposes established by State law. Our review
disclosed that MSDE did not obtain and compare actual LEA expenditures to the
LEA’s application to ensure the funds were used according to the related
applications. For example, the LEAs provided documentation in the applications,
such as salary schedules for the Teacher Salary Incentive program, and budgeted
positions for community school coordinators for the Concentration of Poverty
program4 to show intended uses of Blueprint funds. MSDE did not verify that the
resultant actual salaries were consistent with the salary schedule amounts included
in the application.
We conducted a limited test of the Teacher Salary Incentive program by
judgmentally selecting 12 teachers with related annual salaries totaling
approximately $800,000 from three LEAs. Our test determined that the salaries
paid during fiscal years 2020 and 2021 agreed to the related grant applications
without exception. As noted in Figure 3, Blueprint grant expenditures totaled
$393.6 million during fiscal year 2021, including $75 million for the Teacher
Salary Incentive program.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MSDE
a. obtain adequate documentation from the LEAs to verify, at least on a test
basis, the propriety of Blueprint related expenditures for fiscal years 2020
and 2021 and pursue recovery of any amounts that were not supported
and consistent with the application; and
b. develop a policy to ensure future Blueprint funds are expended for the
purposes established by State law (such as conducting an internal audit
or engaging an independent accounting firm).
4 The purposes of the Teacher Salary Incentive and the Concentration of Poverty grants are to
provide funds to increase teacher salaries to improve recruitment and retention of high–quality
teachers, and provide a community school coordinator and a health care professional at each
school.

Finding 2 (Policy Issue)
MSDE should consider establishing a monitoring process to ensure LEAs
implemented appropriate corrective actions to address findings from our
Office’s financial management practices audit reports.
Analysis
MSDE should consider establishing a monitoring process to ensure LEAs
implemented appropriate corrective actions to address findings from our Office’s
financial management practices audit reports. In accordance with the
requirements of the State Government Article, Section 2-1220(e) of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) conducts an audit of
the financial management practices of each LEA at least once every six years.5
Our most recent audit reports of the 24 LEAs identified 318 findings, including
171 findings repeated from the respective preceding audit (see Exhibit 1). These
findings related to various functional areas such as procurement and
disbursements, transportation services, Board oversight and management, and
human resources and payroll.
Our review disclosed that although MSDE can obtain copies of the LEA audit
reports, it did not require LEAs to periodically report on the status of corrective
actions. Consequently, MSDE lacked assurance that audit findings were
appropriately addressed to ensure LEAs’ policies, procedures, and controls were
effective in accounting for and safeguarding assets, and provided for the efficient
use of financial resources. In our opinion, MSDE obtaining periodic reports from
LEAs on the status of corrective actions, coupled with the potential for limited
verification, would help promote accountability and ensure audit findings are
addressed. For example, MSDE could obtain and review pertinent documents to
ensure the LEA implemented policies and procedures to satisfactorily address the
findings.
Although State law does not require MSDE to monitor the corrective actions
taken by the LEAs, the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
Section 5-111(a), provides that each local education board shall submit reports
required by the State Board of Education and by the MSDE Superintendent.
Legal counsel to the Maryland General Assembly advised us that such a report
5 Subject to the certain limitations, beginning in fiscal year 2017, a local school system shall be
exempt from the audit requirement if the county governing body, the county board of education,
and the county delegation to the Maryland General Assembly consisting of the county senators
and delegates each submits a letter to the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee requesting an
exemption on or before November 1 of fiscal year 2017, or on or before November 1 of the last
year of a 6-year audit cycle, as determined by the OLA. A local school system may not be
exempt for two consecutive 6-year audit cycles.
14

--- Page 17 ---
could reasonably include periodic corrective actions of findings and
recommendations contained in LEA audit reports.
Recommendation 2
We recommend that MSDE
a. establish a monitoring process which requires periodic reports of
corrective actions taken by the LEAs for findings noted in OLA financial
management practices audit reports, as feasible;
b. consider implementing a limited verification of the corrective actions
reported by the LEAs; and
c. document its review of the corrective actions and follow-up process to
ensure that reasonable actions were taken by the LEAs to correct
deficiencies noted.
Background – Enrollment Audits of LEAs
In accordance with State law, MSDE generally uses the self-reported student
enrollment count from the LEAs to determine the total full-time equivalent
enrollment for State aid for the next fiscal year. At the beginning of each school
year, the LEAs submit electronic files of enrollment counts as of September 30th
to MSDE in order to update enrollment data on MSDE’s automated Web Data
Collection System (WDCS). Based on system edits, MSDE generates reports
from the WDCS of data errors and irregularities to be corrected by the LEA, or if
deemed appropriate, overridden by MSDE, to finalize the data for use in
calculating the State aid funding for the subsequent fiscal year.
According to State regulations, in order for a student to be properly enrolled, the
LEA must have certain documentation on file (such as, residency, immunizations,
and have recorded attendance at least one day in September). MSDE’s Audit
Office conducts enrollment audits of each of the State’s 24 LEAs generally every
two years. The audits include a review of the supporting documentation to ensure
the students reported by the LEA were properly enrolled as of September 30th.
These audits also include processes and eligibility requirements for other
programs such as special education and transportation.
15

--- Page 18 ---
Finding 3 (Policy Issue)
MSDE’s enrollment audits did not incorporate certain procedures to ensure
LEAs properly recorded and reported student attendance used to calculate
State funding.
Analysis
MSDE’s enrollment audits did not incorporate certain procedures to ensure LEAs
properly recorded and reported student attendance totals that were used to
calculate State funding. Specifically, MSDE did not use a risk-based approach to
determine which enrollment records to test, did not review controls over the
LEA’s processes to record student attendance, and did not conduct a
comprehensive review to determine if errors noted during its audits were the
result of potential systemic issues requiring corrective action at the LEAs.
MSDE Did Not Use a Risk-Based Approach to Test Enrollment
MSDE’s Audit Office did not use available reports to help identify LEAs or
specific schools within an LEA that may not be properly reporting enrollment.
Rather, MSDE advised us that it selects a random non-statistical sample of
student data for its enrollment audits. The test sample size, which ranged from 50
to 200 students per LEA, is subjectively determined by MSDE audit staff
primarily based on a consideration of the LEA’s student population.
We believe that MSDE’s sample selection process was less likely to identify
significant enrollment errors and precluded MSDE from projecting any errors to
the total full-time equivalent enrollment that is used to determine State aid for the
next fiscal year. Specifically, the most recent audits for the 24 LEAs identified 3
LEAs that had a total of 4 unsupported students enrolled in their schools, and
MSDE recovered $15,151 from the Foundation grant program6 for those
students. In addition, a further $91,022 was recovered as a result of these audits
from 13 LEAs for other programs, such as transportation. See Exhibit 2 for a
summary of MSDE’s most recent audits of its Foundation grant program (such as,
enrollment, transportation, and special education).
In our opinion, a risk-based approach would enable MSDE to focus its testing on
areas where there may be known or likely errors in the reported enrollment. For
example, we identified two reports from WDCS that MSDE could use to select
students for testing in areas with a potential risk that enrollment is overstated.
6 The Foundation grant is the major State Aid program for primary and secondary education,
which estimates the amount of funding necessary to provide adequate resources to educate the
average student.
16

--- Page 19 ---
Statistical Process Control Report (SPC)
The SPC report identifies individual schools (as well as specific grades within
those schools) that have fluctuations in student enrollment. Although not
incorporated within the audit process, MSDE obtained explanations from the
LEAs for large variances of enrollment compared to the five-year enrollment
average; however, the explanations were not pursued for further investigation.
For example, the SPC report for school year 2020-2021 for one LEA
disclosed three instances (one instance at three different schools) where the
reported enrollment was between 92-174 students higher than the five-year
enrollment average for the grade at that school, representing an increase of up
to 40 percent. The LEA’s explanation for the increased enrollment was
simply that enrollment increased at the grade level.
Attendance Error and Summary Report (AES)
According to MSDE’s September Attendance Data Collection Manual, the
AES report is generated by the LEAs to ensure the accuracy of reported
enrollment since it identifies potential errors in the enrollment data that may
require subsequent correction. For example, the report identifies students
recorded by more than one LEA, as well as inconsistent data, such as a student
whose age does not appear proper for the grade. Therefore, if the report
identifies a particular school with a high volume of errors, MSDE could
specify this school as high risk when selecting its enrollment audit test
samples. Our review of the report for September 2021 activity identified 218
potential errors. The report disclosed 84 of the 218 potential errors were
students over the age of five that were enrolled in pre-kindergarten, of which
12 instances were from one school. Based on our review, MSDE does not
have a specific process to obtain explanations from the LEAs or determine if
the LEA corrected the error identified on the AES report.
The Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education (OIGE) issued a
report dated April 20, 2022 on MSDE’s State Aid Enrollment Counts. Based
primarily on an analysis of enrollment data, the OIGE report identified 2,973
students deemed eligible for State aid funding that did not meet the requirements
in State regulations for attendance and enrollment. These students represented at
least $12.9 million in State and $10.5 million in local funding over school years
2016-2017 through 2020-2021. The OIGE noted that the LEAs had self–reported
over 92 percent (2,757) of these errors in subsequent reporting, and went on to
state that MSDE did not identify or act on these discrepancies during the reporting
process or during the State aid program audits completed.
The OIGE report made four recommendations to improve MSDE’s oversight of
enrollment counts including the use of a risk-based approach for determining the
17

--- Page 20 ---
frequency that an LEA is audited for student enrollment purposes and for
selecting students for testing. In its written response, MSDE generally agreed
with the OIGE recommendations. However, MSDE stated that it is not required
by law to update or reconcile the student enrollment count as of September 30th
after the data is submitted to the appropriate State entities for budget purposes on
December 1st of each year.
MDSE Did Not Review LEA Controls Over Recording Attendance
MSDE’s Audit Office did not determine if LEAs had an adequate process to
record attendance in automated systems and assess if user access to the attendance
records was properly controlled. In addition, MSDE did not assess the need for
the LEAs to obtain an independent review of its student attendance system on a
periodic basis.
MSDE Did Not Assess Errors for Corrective Action
MSDE did not conduct a comprehensive review to determine if errors noted
during its audits, indicated by its system reports, or reported by LEAs were the
result of potential systemic issues that required corrective action at the LEAs. For
example, MSDE did not determine the underlying cause(s) of errors noted,
determine if further testing was necessary, and make recommendations for
corrective actions as appropriate.
Recommendation 3
We recommend that MSDE
a. as part of its non-statistical sampling, use available WDCS reports for
enrollment audits to determine if schools have an increased risk of
improper student enrollment reporting;
b. determine the need for an independent review of the automated
attendance systems used by each LEA to ensure that sufficient controls
exist over the attendance recordation process; and
c. determine if errors noted during enrollment audits or other third party
audits or reviews are the result of potential systemic issues and make
applicable recommendations for corrective actions to the LEAs.
Information Systems Security and Control
We determined that Findings 4 through 7 related to “cybersecurity”, as defined by
the State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b) of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, and therefore are subject to redaction from the publicly
available report in accordance with the State Government Article, Section 2-
1224(i). Consequently, the specifics of the following findings, including the

Monitoring of State Grants
Finding 8
MSDE did not always verify the accuracy of expenditure and performance
data reported by grantees, and did not always conduct site visits of grantees.
Analysis
MSDE did not always verify the accuracy of expenditure and performance data
reported by grantees, and did not always conduct site visits of grantees.
According to its records, during fiscal year 2022, MSDE administered 37 State-
funded grant programs with expenditures totaling $76.4 million.7 We tested 9
grant awards totaling $14.4 million (generally selected based on dollar
significance) associated with 3 grant programs with fiscal year 2021 expenditures
totaling $13.0 million (see Figure 4).

 MSDE did not obtain
documentation to verify the performance data (such as, reports of attendance
and graduation rates) reported by the grantees for any of the grants tested. In
addition, MSDE did not obtain documentation to verify the accuracy of grant
expenditures reported by grantees for the four services to public school
children grants tested. Grantees were required to submit periodic expenditure
and performance reports. This data is critical for ensuring the propriety of the
grant expenditures and grantee compliance with grant performance
requirements. As a result, assurance was lacking that required services were
provided and grant funds were used in accordance with the related grant
agreements.
7 These expenditures exclude grants for which there were no specific grant deliverables, such as
the Bridge to Excellence grants to local education agencies.
20

--- Page 23 ---
 MSDE’s policies and grant agreements did not always require grantee site
visits (in-person or virtual visits during the COVID-19 pandemic health
crisis). Consequently, MSDE did not perform site visits for seven of the nine
grants tested with awards totaling $13.3 million. Effective June 1, 2020 State
regulations require an annual site visit for each nonprofit organization
receiving grant funds for State-aided institutions grants, but not for the school
for disadvantaged at-risk youth grants and grants to local governments. As
identified in our office’s State Grants performance audit report dated
November 10, 2021, site visits are considered a best practice of a
comprehensive grant monitoring process, which can be used to ensure
progress towards the goals of the grant-funded program. Furthermore, this
best practice was confirmed by MSDE grant monitors, who advised us that
virtual site visits were not always performed as they did not think it possible
to assess all required areas as comprehensively as via an on-site visit.
Similar conditions regarding inadequate grant monitoring of these three grant
programs was commented upon in our preceding audit report. In response to that
report, MSDE indicated that they would establish procedures to verify the
accuracy of the grantees’ self-reported expenditure and/or performance data of the
grants tested by August 2019 and start conducting site visits in July 2019. As
noted above, we noted that these efforts had not been established during our audit
period.
Recommendation 8
We recommend that MSDE
a. verify the accuracy of the grantee’s self-reported expenditure and
performance data (repeat),
b. develop a policy for performing comprehensive documented site visits for
all of its State-fund grant programs and ensure its grant agreements
include a provision for site visits, and
c. perform documented site visits in accordance with the policy it establishes
(repeat).

Purchases and Disbursements
Finding 9
MSDE did not always comply with State procurement regulations including
documenting bid openings, retaining proposals, and publishing contract
awards on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage.
Analysis
MSDE did not always comply with State procurement regulations including
documenting bid openings, retaining procurement documentation, and publishing
contract awards on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA).8 Our test of five
contracts procured between January 2018 and May 2021 (generally selected based
on dollar significance), totaling approximately $90.3 million, disclosed the
following conditions.
 MSDE could not document that at least two State employees were present and
witnessed the proposal openings for three of the five contracts procurements
tested totaling $89.1 million. In addition, MSDE was not able to provide all
required procurement documentation, including technical and price proposals,
and bid evaluations for these three procurements. For example, for one
contract award totaling $46.6 million MSDE indicated proposals were
received from two vendors. MSDE was not able to provide the losing bidder's
technical proposal or the price proposals from either vendor. As a result, we
could not readily determine the propriety of these awards.
 MSDE did not publish four contract awards totaling $43.6 million on
eMM/eMMA as required State regulations. Publishing awards on eMM/eMMA
provides potentially greater reach to the vendor community and improved
transparency over State procurements including information about winning
bidders and the amount of the related awards.
State procurement regulations require documentation that bids were opened with
at least two employees present or publicly, and all critical procurement
documentation, including technical and price proposals, and bid evaluations to be
maintained in the procurement file. The regulations further require awards to be
published on eMMA within 30 days after approval of the contract.
8 eMaryland Marketplace Advantage (eMMA) is an internet-based, interactive procurement system
managed by the Department of General Services (DGS). Effective July 2019, DGS replaced
eMarylamd Marketplace (eMM) with eMMA.
22

--- Page 25 ---
Recommendation 9
We recommend that MSDE comply with State procurement regulations.
Specifically, we recommend that MSDE
a. document bid openings by at least two employees;
b. retain all required procurement documentation, including technical and
price proposals and bid evaluations; and
c. publish contract awards on eMMA as required.

Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland State Department
of Education (MSDE) – Headquarters, Aid to Education, Funding for Educational
Organizations, and Children’s Cabinet Interagency Fund for the period beginning
January 1, 2018 and ending May 31, 2021. The audit was conducted in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,
appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained
provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine MSDE’s financial
transactions, records and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance with
applicable State laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included monitoring Local Education Agencies, grants,
federal funds, procurements and disbursements, budgetary closeout transactions,
payroll, and information systems security and control. We also determined the
status of seven of the eight findings in our preceding audit report.
Our audit also included certain support services (including payroll processing,
purchasing, maintenance of accounting records, and related fiscal functions)
provided by MSDE to its units or divisions. Our audit did not include an
evaluation of internal controls over compliance with federal laws and regulations
for federal financial assistance programs and an assessment of MSDE’s
compliance with those laws and regulations because the State of Maryland
engages an independent accounting firm to annually audit such programs
administered by State agencies, including MSDE.
Our assessment of internal controls was based on agency procedures and controls
in place at the time of our fieldwork. Our tests of transactions and other auditing
procedures were generally focused on the transactions occurring during our audit
period of January 1, 2018 to May 31, 2021, but may include transactions before or
after this period as we considered necessary to achieve our audit objectives.
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, tests of transactions,
24

--- Page 27 ---
and to the extent practicable, observations of MSDE operations. Generally,
transactions were selected for testing based on auditor judgment, which primarily
considers risk, the timing or dollar amount of the transaction, or the significance
of the transaction to the area of operation reviewed. As a matter of course, we do
not normally use sampling in our tests, so unless otherwise specifically indicated,
neither statistical nor non-statistical audit sampling was used to select the
transactions tested. Therefore, unless sampling is specifically indicated in the
finding, the results from any tests conducted or disclosed by us cannot be used to
project those results to the entire population from which the test items were
selected.
We performed various data extracts of pertinent information from the State’s
Financial Management Information System (such as revenue and expenditure
data) and the State’s Central Payroll Bureau (payroll data), as well as from the
contractor administering the State’s Corporate Purchasing Card Program (credit
card activity). The extracts are performed as part of ongoing internal processes
established by the Office of Legislative Audits and were subject to various tests to
determine data reliability. We determined that the data extracted from these
various sources were sufficiently reliable for the purposes the data were used
during this audit.
We also extracted data from the Division of Rehabilitation Services’ financial
records for the purpose of testing certain areas such as payments made for
consumers under individual plans for employment. We performed various tests of
the relevant data and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the
purposes the data were used during the audit. Finally, we performed other
auditing procedures that we considered necessary to achieve our objectives. The
reliability of data used in this report for background or informational purposes
was not assessed.
MSDE’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records;
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including safeguarding of assets; and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved. As
provided in Government Auditing Standards, there are five components of
internal control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities,
information and communication, and monitoring. Each of the five components,
when significant to the audit objectives, and as applicable to MSDE, were
considered by us during the course of this audit.
25

--- Page 28 ---
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes findings relating to conditions that we consider to be
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect MSDE’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. Our report also includes findings regarding significant instances of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Finally, this report
includes findings, which are identified as a “Policy Issue”. Such findings
represent significant operational or financial-related issues for which formal
criteria may not necessarily exist and for which management has significant
discretion in addressing, but the recommendation represents prudent and or
practical actions, which we believe should be implemented by the agency to
improve outcomes. Other less significant findings were communicated to MSDE
that did not warrant inclusion in this report.
State Government Article Section 2-1224(i) requires that we redact in a manner
consistent with auditing best practices any cybersecurity findings before a report
is made available to the public. This results in the issuance of two different
versions of an audit report that contains cybersecurity findings – a redacted
version for the public and an unredacted version for government officials
responsible for acting on our audit recommendations.
The State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b), states that
cybersecurity is defined as “processes or capabilities wherein systems,
communications, and information are protected and defended against damage,
unauthorized use or modification, and exploitation”. Based on that definition, and
in our professional judgment, we concluded that certain findings in this report fall
under that definition. Consequently, for the publicly available audit report all
specifics as to the nature of cybersecurity findings and required corrective actions
have been redacted. We have determined that such aforementioned practices, and
government auditing standards, support the redaction of this information from the
public audit report. The specifics of these cybersecurity findings have been
26

--- Page 29 ---
communicated to MSDE and those parties responsible for acting on our
recommendations in an unredacted audit report.
MSDE’s response to our findings and recommendations is included as an
appendix to this report. Depending on the version of the audit report, responses to
any cybersecurity findings may be redacted in accordance with State law. As
prescribed in the State Government Article, Section 2- 1224 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, we will advise MSDE regarding the results of our review of its
response.

Oversight and Monitoring of Local Education Agencies
Finding 1
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) did not ensure LEAs used
Blueprint for Maryland’s Future funds in accordance with the purposes established by
State law.
We recommend that MSDE
a. obtain adequate documentation from the LEAs to verify, at least on a test basis, the
propriety of Blueprint related expenditures for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and pursue
recovery of any amounts that were not supported and consistent with the application;
and
b. develop a policy to ensure future Blueprint funds are expended for the purposes
established by State law (such as conducting an internal audit or engaging an
independent accounting firm).

Maryland State Department of Education
Agency Response Form
Finding 2 (Policy Issue)
MSDE should consider establishing a monitoring process to ensure LEAs implemented
appropriate corrective actions to address findings from our Office’s financial management
practices audit reports.
We recommend that MSDE
a. establish a monitoring process which requires periodic reports of corrective actions
taken by the LEAs for findings noted in OLA financial management practices audit
reports, as feasible;
b. consider implementing a limited verification of the corrective actions reported by the
LEAs; and
c. document its review of the corrective actions and follow-up process to ensure that
reasonable actions were taken by the LEAs to correct deficiencies noted.

not require MSDE to monitor the corrective actions taken by the LEAs
in response to OLA audit reports. MSDE does not have express authority
over the enforcement of LEA’s corrective actions to OLA audits. The
responsibility lies with the local board of education and the local school
superintendent who oversees the LEA’s daily operations and financial
management practices.
It should be noted that the OLA already performs follow up on prior
audit findings during their financial management audits of LEAs.
According to State Government Article, 2-1224(g)(7)(iii), the
Legislative Auditor shall advise the Joint Audit and Evaluation
Committee when a local school system has not taken the action the local
school system indicated in its response to a recommendation. The OLA
can also require any unit that has 5 or more repeat audit findings to
report on corrective actions taken within 9 months of the audit report
being issued, according to State Government Article, 2-1224(h)(2).
Although the OLA advised MSDE that State Government Article,
2-1224(h)(2) does not apply to their audits of local school system, State
Government Article, 2-1220(e)(5), states that the Joint Audit and
Evaluation Committee may direct the Office of Legislative Audits to

Auditor’s Comment: MSDE’s response reflects agreement with our recommendations
pending consultation with its legal counsel and State Board. We appreciate MSDE’s
willingness to implement our recommendations, while acknowledging that the State
Government Article, 2-1220(e)(5) provides our Office and the Joint Audit and Evaluation
Committee (JAEC) with the authority to audit LEAs. We remain convinced that our
LEA audits conducted every six years (or twelve years if an exemption is granted by the
JAEC) in conjunction with MSDE’s agreed upon enhanced efforts during the interim
periods will result in improved accountability over State education funding.

Agency Response Form
Finding 3 (Policy Issue)
MSDE’s enrollment audits did not incorporate certain procedures to ensure LEAs
properly recorded and reported student attendance used to calculate State funding.
We recommend that MSDE
a. as part of its non-statistical sampling, use available WDCS reports for enrollment
audits to determine if schools have an increased risk of improper student enrollment
reporting;
b. determine the need for an independent review of the automated attendance systems
used by each LEA to ensure that sufficient controls exist over the attendance
recordation process; and
c. determine if errors noted during enrollment audits or other third party audits or
reviews are the result of potential systemic issues and make applicable
recommendations for corrective actions to the LEAs.
Agency Response
Analysis
Please provide MSDE would like to provide some additional clarification. The
additional comments as Attendance Error and Summary Report report identifies warning errors
deemed necessary. in the Web Data Collection System application including verification
when a student’s date of birth and age is over the age of five and in Pre-
K. These warnings are potential errors that assist the LEA in verifying
their data submissions. Students may be in Pre-K and over the age of
five in accordance with COMAR 13A.08.01.02-2. Parents or legal
guardians may submit a one-year level of maturity waiver for a
kindergarten-age child if they believe that a delay in kindergarten
attendance is in the best interest of their child.
In addition, MSDE requires that LEAs adhere to capturing all attendance
data elements as identified and defined in the Maryland Student Records
System Manual (2020). Each LEA is responsible for developing and
implementing procedures and controls to ensure that these data are
collected, and records are maintained accurately in accordance with the
guidelines set forth in the manual.

explain disagreement. and has resulted in a significantly low error rate. Based on the number of
students identified in the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for
Education (OIGE) report as ineligible for funding over the five-year
period, MSDE had greater than 99.9% accuracy of reporting for state aid
funding.
In addition, the OPRA has implemented additional error checks as part
of the Early and End-of-Year Attendance data collections to ensure
accurate reporting by the LEAs across the academic year. These
additional error checks will be performed annually beginning in spring
2023.
Given the accuracy of the data and the additional error checks
implemented as part of the Early and End of Year Attendance data
collections, MSDE has determined that an independent review of the
LEAs attendance systems is not warranted. MSDE will continue to
monitor data quality for future determinations.
Auditor’s Comment: In response to recommendation 3b, MSDE indicates that the
OIGE report stated that MSDE had greater than 99.9% accuracy of reporting (enrollment)
for state aid funding. We understand that the OIGE did not make this statement in its
report, but it was provided by MSDE in its response to the OIGE report, and was subject
to clarification by the OIGE which appeared to refute MSDE’s conclusion. Regardless,
due to the significant amount of funding that is based on student enrollment, OLA
continues to believe that MSDE should ensure that sufficient controls exist over the
automated attendance recordation process at each LEA.
