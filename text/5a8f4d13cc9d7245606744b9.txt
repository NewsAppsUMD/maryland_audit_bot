Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland Legal Services Corporation (MLSC) is a nonstock, nonprofit
corporation that distributes funds to grantees (nonprofit organizations) that
provide certain legal assistance to income-eligible clients who are unable to pay
for private counsel. MLSC is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors
appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Maryland Senate.
In accordance with the Annotated Code of Maryland, MLSC receives the vast
majority of its funding from the Maryland Legal Services Corporation Fund
(Fund), which is administered by the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC).
The Fund primarily includes interest on lawyer trust accounts (referred to as
IOLTA) and certain surcharges assessed in civil court cases as provided for in
State law. In addition, effective July 1, 2017, State law was amended to provide
for the Governor to appropriate $2 million each year to the Fund from abandoned
property funds deposited in the State’s General Fund. Prior to this change,
funding from the abandoned property funds was $1.5 million each year.
Throughout each fiscal year, the AOC issues equal monthly disbursements from
the Fund to MLSC based on projected Fund income. The table below depicts the
amounts transferred by AOC from the Fund to MLSC related to fiscal years 2014
through 2016, including the original revenue sources.

Financial Statement Audits
In accordance with the Human Services Article, Section 11-407 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, MLSC engaged an independent accounting firm to perform
audits of its financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2015,
and 2016. In the related audit reports, the firm stated that MLSC’s financial
statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
MLSC and the respective changes in its financial position for the years then ended
in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
Findings and Recommendations
Our audit did not disclose any deficiencies in the design or operation of MLSC’s
internal control. Our audit also did not disclose any instances of noncompliance
with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
A draft copy of this report was provided to MLSC. Since there are no
recommendations in this report, a written response was not necessary.
Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have conducted a fiscal compliance audit of the Maryland Legal Services
Corporation (MLSC) for the period beginning June 26, 2014 and ending May 7,
2017, as prescribed in the Human Services Article, Section 11-408 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland. The audit was conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
The objectives of this audit were to examine MLSC’s financial transactions,
records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance with applicable State
laws, rules, and regulations.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of significance and risk. The areas
4

--- Page 7 ---
addressed by the audit included cash receipts, bank accounts, and grant
disbursements.
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit procedures included inquiries of
appropriate personnel, inspections of documents and records, observations of
MLSC’s operations, and tests of transactions. Generally, transactions were
selected for testing based on auditor judgment, which primarily considers risk.
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, neither statistical nor non-statistical audit
sampling was used to select the transactions tested. Therefore, the results of the
tests cannot be used to project those results to the entire population from which
the test items were selected. We also performed other auditing procedures that we
considered necessary to achieve our audit objectives. The reliability of data used
in this report for background or informational purposes was not assessed.
MLSC’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
