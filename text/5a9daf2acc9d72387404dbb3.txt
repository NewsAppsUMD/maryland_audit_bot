Key Findings – Policies
Procurement – (pg. 16)
(cid:131) Policies did not address small procurements under
$15,000, procurement of services, or the use of sole
source procurements.
Equipment – (p.23)
(cid:131) DCPS did not have any formal equipment policies,
including requirements for record keeping and
conducting physical inventories.
Transportation – (pg. 36)
(cid:131) DCPS had no policy to govern the criteria to be used
for determining bus contractor payments. The
methodology used was based on comparisons to
other LEAs and negotiation with the contractors, and
did not consider actual costs for the specific
elements that comprise the payments.
Board Operations – (pg. 51)

in accordance with State law.

Key Findings – Other Issues
Facilities Maintenance - (pgs. 31-32)
(cid:131) A comparison of maintenance staffing at DCPS
to national standards showed that DCPS may not
be adequately staffed. A potential consequence
of limited staffing is an increase in deferred
maintenance. DCPS has indicated a long-
standing backlog of deferred maintenance.
Transportation – (pgs. 36-37)
(cid:131) Certain components of the formula used to
establish bus contractor payment rates should
be reevaluated as the rates used by DCPS may
result in unnecessary payments of $1 million
over the life of the buses.
