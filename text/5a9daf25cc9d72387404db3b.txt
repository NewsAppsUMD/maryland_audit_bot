Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Certain aspects of MSDE’s “Loaned Educator
Program” appear to be in conflict with State laws
and regulations and the extent and cost were not
fully disclosed in the budget.
(cid:190) Inspections of child care facilities were not
conducted as required and the propriety of certain
provider billing information was not verified.
(cid:190) A $13.3 million dollar unsubstantiated federal
fund revenue accrual was recorded at the 2008
FYE to eliminate a deficit.
(cid:190) Certain grants for family support centers were not
effectively monitored.
(cid:190) Certain aspects of the MD Business Enterprise
Program for the Blind did not appear to operate in
accordance with State laws and regulations for
the benefit of blind individuals.
(cid:190) Controls were deficient in several areas including
information system security and procurement.

Loaned Educator Program
Background:
(cid:190) For 30 years, MSDE has been authorized under
State law and regulations to contract with local
school systems to borrow educators to perform
specific jobs at MSDE.
(cid:190) Under annual contracts entered into between
MSDE and the school systems, MSDE reimburses
the systems for the educators’ salaries and
certain fringe benefits.
(cid:190) During FY 2009, 66 educators from 17 local
school systems were loaned to MSDE at a cost of
$8.5 million. For the period of FY 2006 to 2008
MSDE paid $26.5 million, and employed an
average of 76 loaned educators per year.
(cid:190) MSDE’s FY 2009 cost per loaned educator
ranged from $82,000 to $197,000 a year.

Loaned Educator Program
(cont’d)
As implemented, certain aspects of the Program
appear to conflict with State law and regulations.
(Finding 1)
(cid:190) During FY 2009, MSDE employed 66 loaned
educators, each filling positions in one of six
different categories, including 15 educators who
served as professional assistants, in executive
management (3) and director positions (12).
(cid:190) Many educators have worked at MSDE for long
periods – ranging up to 15 years. Individuals in
executive management participated in the Program
for 5 to 8 years (an average of 6 ½ years) and
those functioning as division directors participated
from 1 to 14 years (an average of 4½ years).
(cid:190) At our request, MSDE obtained an AG’s opinion that
concluded that the services of educators can be
obtained on a temporary basis. If performing a job
for more than a brief period of time, the educator
should become a State employee in the State
Personnel Management System.

Loaned Educator Program
(cont’d)
(cid:190) The Program raises concerns over potential
conflicts of interest and the necessity of filing State
financial disclosure statements. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) A number of educators fill positions involved in
programmatic and fiscal decisions that have
statewide impact, including their own school
system.
(cid:131) Three of the educators, in their capacity as MSDE
officials, signed certain documents relating to
their own contracts, while certain documents
relating to 31 contracts were signed by a loaned
educator while representing MSDE.
(cid:131) Educator contracts did not require the individuals
to submit annual financial disclosure statements.
If the 66 FY 2009 educators were State
employees, they would be required to file
statements; however, only 4 had filed.

Loaned Educator Program
(cont’d)
(cid:190)The extent and full cost of the program was not
disclosed to the budget committees. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) In the FY 2009 budget submission, 14
“loaned educator” contracts totaling $1.2
million were noted, while 52 others were
simply listed as “education contracts.”
(cid:131) Full disclosure of costs should be made
because the loaned educators were
sometimes paid salaries significantly higher
than State employees in similar positions.

Child Care Programs
Since 7/2005, MSDE has been responsible for child
care programs, including licensing, compliance
monitoring, and enforcement for 8,967 family child
care homes and 2,751 child care centers.
MSDE also oversees the Child Care Subsidy Program
(CCSP) that paid $99 million in assistance during FY
2008 to families to help them meet child care needs.
(cid:190) Health and safety inspections of child care
facilities were not always performed as required.
(Finding 4) Our test of MSDE records for 100
facilities during a 38-month period, found that 76
facilities were either missing a required inspection
and/or inspections were conducted untimely.
(cid:190) Procedures were not adequate to ensure the
propriety of CCSP payments. (Finding 5)
(cid:190) Access was not sufficiently restricted to the
automated system used to process licenses and
CCSP payments to child care providers. (Finding 6)

Federal Fund Deficit
(cid:190) MSDE recorded $13.3 million in
unsubstantiated Federal fund revenue at the
2008 FYE for expenditures incurred under the
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)
grant. (Finding 7)
(cid:190) This is a longstanding issue in that the
unreimbursed expenditures relate to FY 2002
and 2003. No authorized funding remains.

Contract / Grant Monitoring
MSDE did not adequately monitor a vendor that oversees
and manages 25 family support centers (FSC) that
provide developmental, educational & health services to
young parents and their children. (Finding 8)
During FY 2006 to 2008, MSDE paid the vendor $15.4
million under a contract entered into by DHR. When the
contract expired on 6/30/08, MSDE executed a grant
with the same vendor to provide similar services.
(cid:131) MSDE did not adequately substantiate amounts
invoiced under the contract, which included vendor
management services and grants to FSC.
(cid:131) MSDE did not ensure the vendor performed the
required services.
(cid:131) The grant agreement, under which the vendor was to
be paid $861,000 annually, eliminated certain
safeguards included in the prior contract, such as
requiring the vendor to monitor FSC, ensuring they
received annual audits and resolving any related
deficiencies.

MD Business Enterprise Program for the Blind
(cid:190)Certain aspects of the Program did not appear
to be operated to ensure that blind individuals
benefited as intended by State law. (Finding 9)
The Program’s objective is to prepare blind
individuals to operate successful vending &
food service operations in public facilities.
MSDE delegated the operation of vending
machines to Blind Industries and Services of
MD (BISM).
BISM reported vending machine commissions
of $405,000 on sales of $1.7 million during the
FYE 9/30/08.

MD Business Enterprise Program for the Blind
(cid:131) MSDE and BISM have been operating without a
current contract since May 2002.
(cid:131) During FY 2008 BISM subcontracted the
vending machine operations to several for-profit
companies that were not required to employ the
blind. The expired contract generally prohibited
such subcontracting.
(cid:131) MSDE originally contracted with BISM because
State law generally requires agencies to use
BISM, if BISM provides the service at fair
market prices; however, in 2002, the Court of
Appeals ruled that the law does not apply when
BISM does not actually provide the service.

Other Issues
(cid:190) Security and controls over key MSDE information
technology (IT) operations need enhancement.
(Findings 11 to 13) MSDE did not have a
comprehensive IT disaster recovery plan and
proper monitoring of security related events was
not performed.
(cid:190) Procurement and related payment practices were
not always consistent with State regulations.
(Finding 14) Our tests found certain contracts
were approved after related services had been
performed and payments were made to vendors
other than those on the related approved
purchase orders.
