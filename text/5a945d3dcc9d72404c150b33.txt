Background
The Public Safety Article, Section 2-514 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires local law enforcement agencies (LLEAs) and the Department of State
Police (DSP) to report specified information to the Governor’s Office of Crime
Control and Prevention (GOCCP) about DNA evidence. The law requires
biennial reporting by these agencies of the preceding calendar year’s data.
The law also requires GOCCP to compile the reported data and provide it to
the Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) to summarize and evaluate the reported
data and submit our evaluation report to the Governor and General Assembly.
This OLA report summarizes and evaluates the calendar year 2013 data
reported by the LLEAs to GOCCP.
To implement the law’s requirements, DSP, based on past input from GOCCP
and OLA, issued State regulations to provide certain additional details and
guidance to the LLEAs for reporting data and developed a DNA reporting form.
Additionally, the above parties previously had consulted with legal counsel on
matters of interpretation to aid in implementation of the law. For example,
while the law requires reporting of the average time between DNA collection
and analysis, the requirement should instead be interpreted to require
reporting of the average time between submission of DNA evidence for
analysis and the reporting of the related results. In addition to specifying the
reporting requirements applicable to the LLEAs, the regulations specified
additional information to be reported by DSP and the Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene to GOCCP.
Crime Scene DNA Evidence Collection and Analysis Process
The following flowchart and related comments provide a simple overview of
the DNA collection and analysis process.
Crime Scene
Evidence Biological Screening/ DNA Analysis DNA
Collection Serology Testing Analysis Results
Step 1 – Crime Scene Evidence Collection – Field investigators (such as
detectives) obtain crime scene evidence and follow internal procedures for
identifying and securing such evidence. At the time of collection, field
investigators do not decide which items collected will be used for DNA
evidence. Evidence collected at a crime scene is recorded in an evidence log
to document the chain of custody.
5

--- Page 8 ---
Step 2 – Biological Screening /Serology Testing – When a criminal
investigator or attorney determines that crime scene evidence needs to be
tested for potential DNA matches, the LLEA will submit the potential crime
scene DNA evidence to a crime lab for testing,1 as an initial step to determine
if the evidence contains biological materials that will allow for DNA testing.
LLEAs require written documentation of the requests for testing as well as
reports of the related findings.
Step 3 – DNA Analysis – Based on results from Step 2 above, the LLEA will
determine the actual samples to be used by the crime labs for DNA analysis.
The LLEA then makes a request for DNA analysis. Labs use different testing
methods depending on the amount of DNA material available and the results
from biological testing.
Step 4 – DNA Analysis Results – The DNA analysis may result in a DNA profile
that allows for matching to an individual (or possibly to a group of individuals).
The requestor receives a detailed report of the lab results. This information
can then be used by the LLEAs as part of the investigative process.
Multiple DNA Submissions
LLEA personnel may decide to submit crime scene evidence at any time in the
investigative process. As a result, there may be multiple submissions related
to the same case submitted at different times. For the purposes of this
report, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Original submission – the initial submission of crime scene DNA evidence for
subsequent testing and reporting.
Supplemental submission – an additional submission of crime scene DNA
evidence prior to the completion of the DNA analysis process for the original
submission.
Resubmission - an additional submission of crime scene DNA evidence after
the original submission has been tested and the related report issued.
1This biological screening includes serology testing and other testing, as necessary, to
determine if materials are sufficient for DNA testing. Serology testing uses certain chemicals
to confirm the existence of bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, or semen.

Scope and Methodology
We summarized and evaluated the data reported to us by the Governor’s
Office of Crime Control and Prevention (GOCCP) that it obtained from local law
enforcement agencies (LLEAs) as of October 17, 2014, on DNA evidence for
calendar year 2013. Pursuant to the Public Safety Article, Section 2-514 of
the Annotated Code of Maryland, by April 1 of every even-numbered year,
each LLEA is required to report data from the preceding calendar year for the
following four areas to GOCCP:
1) the crimes for which crime scene DNA evidence is routinely collected
2) the number of cases in which crime scene DNA evidence samples were
collected during the preceding year for each category of crime
3) the average time between crime scene DNA evidence submission and
analysis results
4) the number of cases in which crime scene DNA evidence samples were
submitted and not analyzed at the time of the study
The required reporting also included information on the number of crime
scene DNA evidence samples submitted to the Statewide DNA database
during calendar year 2013, which was reported by the Department of State
Police (DSP). Finally, the law required reporting the number of crime scene
evidence samples related to sexual assaults collected by hospitals in each
county during calendar year 2013.
To coordinate the reporting of data by LLEAs, GOCCP, with input from both the
Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) and DSP, developed a DNA web-based
reporting instrument to be completed by all LLEAs and submitted to GOCCP
for subsequent compilation and reporting to OLA. The DNA web reporting
form was designed to capture the data required to be reported, as stated in
the aforementioned Maryland law and related regulations. LLEAs submitted
their DNA reports online through a GOCCP-designated web-based reporting
site. GOCCP then provided a compilation report and a file of all LLEA reports
to OLA. A copy of the DNA web-based reporting instrument is included in this
report as Exhibit 5.
To determine the extent to which LLEAs complied with the legal requirement
for submission to GOCCP, we compared the responses received to a database
of LLEAs provided by GOCCP.
7

--- Page 10 ---
To accomplish our task of summarizing and evaluating the reported data, we
contacted appropriate personnel at the GOCCP, DSP, certain LLEAs, and the
Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), as these
entities either were responsible for reporting required data or assisted us in
obtaining the data.
We assessed the reasonableness of the reported data. For the submitted
reports, we performed certain analytical procedures of currently reported data
to the data from the prior reporting period (calendar year 2011), both
collectively and for individual LLEAs. Our analysis included reviews of the four
law enforcement agencies with the highest currently reported totals – the
Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County, and Montgomery County police
departments, and the DSP. This analysis focused on consistency with data
presented in prior reports, taking into account problems encountered in the
prior reporting period. We also obtained the number of crime scene DNA
evidence samples submitted to the Statewide DNA database, which is
maintained by DSP, and contacted DSP to obtain supporting documentation.
Similarly, we reviewed supporting documentation provided by DHMH
regarding the number of hospital forensic examinations related to sexual
assaults reported by DHMH for which it reimbursed each county and
Baltimore City.
Our work to prepare this report did not constitute an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Results and Observations
Conclusion
GOCCP received completed reports from 100 local law enforcement agencies
(LLEAs) out of the 133 LLEAs they requested to provide reports. Of the 100
LLEAs, 45 reported at least one instance during calendar year 2013 of cases
that included collecting crime scene DNA evidence samples (see Exhibit 2).
The remaining 55 LLEAs reported that no crime scene DNA evidence was
collected and submitted by these agencies during calendar year 2013.
Based on our review of the LLEA reports received by GOCCP, we found the
completeness of the data collectively reported by LLEAs to be adversely
impacted by two non-reporting LLEAs – the Baltimore City Police Department
and the Prince George’s County Police Department. In our prior report, dated
June 25, 2013, these two LLEAs reported the first and second largest
numbers of calendar year 2011 cases of DNA evidence collected and DNA
evidence submitted to a lab but not analyzed as of December 31, 2011.
Specifically, these two LLEAs accounted for 2,137 out of 3,829 Statewide
cases with DNA evidence collected (56 percent) and 2,593 out of 3,239
Statewide cases with evidence submitted to a lab but unanalyzed (80
percent).
We found that GOCCP addressed our prior concerns with regards to data
accuracy and comparability between LLEAs. GOCCP revised the reporting
instrument to provide comprehensive guidance in certain areas to address
differing methodologies previously used by LLEAs in collecting and reporting
data. Specifically, we found that the revised reporting instrument clearly
explained how cases were to be accounted for and reported when additional
crime scene DNA evidence samples were submitted for analysis after the
analysis of the original samples had been completed. During prior reporting
periods this explanation was not present, resulting in confusion among LLEAs,
which adversely impacted data accuracy.
Our analysis of trends from the prior reporting period, both collectively for all
reporting entities and individually for the four LLEAs with the highest reported
data totals (the Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County, and Montgomery
County police departments, and the Department of State Police or DSP),
generally disclosed consistency between the data reported for those periods
(after considering the effects of past reporting problems). While we noted
some improvements in performance, including a reduction in the backlog of
unanalyzed DNA crime scene evidence by certain LLEAs, there were a few
9

--- Page 12 ---
instances in which performance had slipped. Table 1 presents a comparison
of selected reported data on a Statewide basis and from the largest LLEAs,
including DSP, for calendar years 2011 and 2013.

Note - The source for the CY 2011 reported totals was the OLA’s June 25, 2013 Special Report on Crime Scene DNA Collection Analysis
Reporting By Law Enforcement Agencies. The sources for the CY 2013 totals can be found in this report in Tables 3, 4, and 5.
For example, from a Statewide perspective the reported average turnaround
time for crime scene DNA evidence analysis (Reporting Item 3) was shortened
from 110 days (calendar 2011) to 93 days (calendar year 2013); however, if
the 2011 results reported by the Baltimore City and Prince George’s County
police departments had been repeated in 2013, then the 2013 Statewide
average would be similar to the 2011 reported total.
On an individual LLEA reporting basis, DSP and the Montgomery County Police
Department reported decreases from 2011 to 2013, while the Anne Arundel
County and Baltimore County police departments reported significant
increases in their average turnaround times between those years.
Specifically, the average turnaround time for Anne Arundel County Police
Department increased from 136 days to 225 days (65 percent) and the
Baltimore County Police Department increased from 164 days to 265 days
(62 percent). An official with the Anne Arundel County Police Department
advised us that increased average turnaround time was the result of clearing
a backlog of older cases, which began during 2013. We were advised by a
Baltimore County Police Department official that its increase in average
10

--- Page 13 ---
turnaround time primarily resulted from staffing vacancies and turnover within
the Department’s crime lab during 2012, which created a processing backlog
into the calendar year 2013 reporting period.
As required by the law, DSP reported that 1,004 crime scene DNA evidence
samples and 1,884 suspect DNA evidence samples were submitted and
qualified for inclusion (that is, met certain State requirements) in the
Statewide DNA database during calendar year 2013. We performed a review
of supporting documentation provided by DPS to assess the data and found it
was consistent with the reported totals. Concerns highlighted in our prior
report, with the accuracy of these figures regarded one-time events that
resulted in a double counting of certain entries that only occurred in the 2011
reporting year, were not an issue in the current reporting period.
The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) reimbursed certain
hospitals throughout the State for performing forensic examinations related to
sexual assaults. As required by DSP regulations that were issued to
implement the aforementioned reporting requirements, DHMH provided a
report of the number of forensic examinations reimbursed to each county and
the City of Baltimore for calendar year 2013. According to this report, DHMH
reimbursed these hospitals for 1,301 examinations. We reviewed the related
data and found that it was reasonable.

Data Reported by Local Law Enforcement Agencies (LLEAs)
Forty-one of the LLEAs responded that they do not routinely collect any DNA
evidence. As such, no answers were required or provided by these LLEAs to
the remaining questions on the reporting form. Consequently, these LLEAs
were not included in the following Tables.
Reporting Item 1 - Check the corresponding box for each crime category in
which DNA crime scene evidence items are routinely collected and submitted
to a crime laboratory for biological analysis.

Note: The number of LLEAs reporting that they routinely collect DNA crime evidence in any of the above categories exceeds the
number who reported that they actually collected crime scene DNA evidence (45 LLEAs for calendar year 2013). This is most
likely due to LLEAs reporting that they typically would collect such evidence for certain cases but had no such collections for
calendar year 2013. The percentages above are based on the 100 LLEAs completing reports.
Our review of the calendar year 2013 reports indicated that the percentages
of LLEAs reporting the collection of crime scene DNA evidence for the various
crime categories listed above are comparable with the prior reporting period
(calendar year 2011).
Our review of the data reported by four of the major LLEAs (the Anne Arundel
County, Baltimore County, and Montgomery County police departments, and
DSP) for Reporting Item 1 found that their responses were generally
consistent with the specific data types (crime category) reported for Reporting
Item 2. In addition, the specific data types for which DNA crime scene
evidence was collected for the four LLEAs were the same as for the previous
reporting period. A detailed schedule of the data reported by individual LLEAs
is included in Exhibit 1.

Reporting Item 2 - Indicate the number of cases in which DNA crime scene
evidence samples were collected and submitted to a crime laboratory for

Note: Forty-five of the 133 LLEAs reported at least one instance of collecting DNA crime scene evidence during calendar year 2013.
The Baltimore City and Prince George’s County police departments are included in this table as they were the two jurisdictions with the
highest number of reported cases in the previous reporting periods. The source for the CY 2011 reported totals was Table 3 in OLA’s
June 25, 2013 Special Report on Crime Scene DNA Collection and Analysis Reporting By Law Enforcement Agencies.
Our review of GOCCP’s compiled reports, which included an analysis of
historical trends from the prior reporting period, indicates that while the four
individual agencies presented above appear reasonable compared to the prior
reports, the total number of cases are likely significantly understated,
because Baltimore City and Prince George’s County police departments were
among the LLEAs that failed to report.
Thirty-one of the 33 non-responding LLEAs have historically reported that they
either have not collected DNA crime scene evidence, or have collected few
samples; therefore, their failure to report likely only had a minor impact on the
accuracy of overall totals presented in the tables and exhibits included in our
current report.
However, the absence of data for the Baltimore City and Prince George’s
County police departments likely had a significant impact on the accuracy of
13

--- Page 16 ---
overall data as those two jurisdictions represented more than half of the
Statewide DNA collections in the prior reporting period.2 Specifically, in our
prior report, dated June 25, 2013, these two LLEAs reported the first and
second largest numbers of cases of DNA evidence collected, collectively
accounting for 2,137 out of the 3,829 reported Statewide cases (56 percent).
A detailed schedule of the reported data by individual LLEAs is included in
Exhibit 2.
Reporting Item 3 - What was the average time between the date the agency
submitted cases with DNA crime scene evidence sample(s) for biological
analysis and the date the agency received the DNA analysis results back from
the crime laboratory (turnaround time)?
Chart 1 stratifies the turnaround time, by range of days, for DNA crime scene
evidence analysis for the 42 LLEAs that provided a specific response. Only 42
of the 45 LLEAs that reported at least one instance of collecting DNA crime
scene evidence during calendar year 2013 responded to this question; the
remaining 3 LLEAs did not report a turnaround time. For one of these three
LLEAs, the DNA analyses were not completed in calendar year 2013 and the
cases were reported in Reporting Item 4. The remaining two LLEAs simply did
not answer the question and GOCCP did not perform an inquiry to obtain
clarification.
2Based on the significant reduction in reported data for CY 2013 as compared to CY 2011,
OLA made inquiries to both the Baltimore City and Prince George’s County police
departments, and obtained representations that both departments did not submit data for
CY 2013.

Notes:
1) Although the law, which is the basis for Reporting Item 3, refers to the “average time between crime
scene DNA collection and analysis,” the web reporting form clarifies that DNA “collection” refers to
when the DNA evidence is submitted to the crime lab.
2) Only 42 of the 45 LLEAs that reported at least one instance of collecting DNA crime scene evidence
during calendar year 2013 provided a specific figure in response to this item. The specific data
reported by these 42 LLEAs are included in Exhibit 3.

Average Turnaround Time for DNA Analysis

--- Page 18 ---
Our review and evaluation of GOCCP’s compiled data and the data obtained
from our prior review disclosed that the average turnaround time for crime
scene DNA analysis for all reporting entities decreased from 110 days in
calendar year 2011 to 93 days in calendar year 2013. The calendar year
2013 average may be understated because of the failure of Baltimore City
and Prince George’s County police departments to report. During the prior
reporting period, these LLEAs had average turnaround times of 307 days and
542 days, respectively. If these two LLEAs had reported those same 2011
averages in 2013, then the overall calendar year 2013 result (average of all
averages) would likely have been similar to that of 2011 (110 days).
For the four major LLEAs responding, our comparison of the average
turnaround times for calendar years 2011 and 2013 identified notable
decreases for DSP (from 128 to 86 days or 33 percent less) and the
Montgomery County Police Department (from 98 to 58 days or 41 percent
less). Conversely, the average turnaround times had significantly increased
for the Anne Arundel County Police Department (from 136 to 225 days or 65
percent more) and Baltimore County Police Department (from 164 to 265
days or 62 percent more).
We contacted both LLEAs and inquired as to the cause(s) for the increased
average time. An Anne Arundel Police Department representative advised us
that the increase resulted from actions taken in 2013 to clear a backlog of
older cases that had built up from earlier years due to staffing shortages. A
Baltimore County Police Department official explained that a combination of
vacancies and turnover of serology staff during 2012 resulted in a backlog of
cases, the impact of which was still being felt during the 2013 reporting
period through an increase in the average turnaround time (Table 4) and the
number of cases submitted for analysis but not completed as of December
31, 2013 (Table 5).
Prior concerns regarding LLEAs reporting resubmissions inconsistently were
addressed by GOCCP’s revision of Reporting Item 3, which in our opinion now
clearly describes how original DNA submissions, supplemental submissions,
and resubmissions should be reported.
A detailed schedule of the data reported by the 42 LLEAs that responded to
Reporting Item 3 is included in Exhibit 3.

Arundel County Police Department had significantly decreased from 234
cases at December 31, 2011 to 42 cases at December 31, 2013 (or 82
percent fewer cases), According to the Anne Arundel Police Department we
were advised that the significant decrease was due to a return to full staffing
of its crime lab during 2013. For the same dates, DPS’ unanalyzed DNA
evidence cases decreased from 66 to 41 cases (or 38 percent fewer cases)
and the Montgomery County Police Department’s cases decreased from 55 to
31 cases (or 44 percent fewer cases).
Unlike the above three large LLEAs, the number of cases with crime scene
DNA evidence samples submitted for analysis but not completed for the
17

--- Page 20 ---
Baltimore County Police Department had increased significantly from 179 to
334 cases (or 87 percent higher). As noted under Reporting Item 3, we were
advised that the increase was attributable to the continued impact of serology
staffing issues experienced during 2012.
As previously noted, 33 LLEAs either did not submit a report or partially
completed a report form. Our review and evaluation of GOCCP’s compiled
data and historical data obtained from our prior review disclosed that the
Statewide number of cases with crime scene DNA evidence samples
submitted for analysis but not completed as of December 31, 2013 is likely to
be significantly understated. Although 31 of the 33 LLEAs reported few or no
such cases as of December 31, 2011, the Baltimore City and Prince George’s
County police departments reported 1,349 and 1,244 cases, respectively.
Collectively, these 2,593 cases accounted for 80 percent of the Statewide
reported total of 3,239 cases as of December 31, 2011. A detailed schedule
of the reported data by individual LLEAs as of December 31, 2013 is included
in Exhibit 4.
Factors Contributing to LLEA Reporting Problems
Our review disclosed that the failure to obtain responses from all LLEAs for
the reporting period ending December 31, 2013 may be due, in part, to
GOCCP’s methods for obtaining the data. We determined through discussions
with GOCCP that requests for the reports (with a link to the web-based
reporting form) were sent by e-mail to the highest ranking public official at
each LLEA (for example, the Chief of Police) but no attempts were made to
reach LLEA officials by phone or in person as was done for the two previous
reporting periods. GOCCP indicated that significant turnover and vacancies at
GOCCP impacted any follow-up efforts for this reporting period, but they intend
to resume in-person contacts with non-compliant LLEAs for future reporting
periods.
We also noted that 24 reports had been partially completed, but submitted
without completing the data fields identifying the LLEA submitting the reports.
This was due to the web reporting form allowing respondents to leave critical
fields blank, such as "Agency Name." An appropriate revision to the reporting
form would be to require identification of the respondent entity at the
beginning of the reporting process (this information is requested at the
conclusion of the current reporting form) and to have the web site accept and
record a report only after all questions are completed by the respondent,
including the identifying information. GOCCP advised that these fixes would
be implemented for future reporting periods.

Submission of Crime Scene Evidence to the Statewide DNA
Database
In accordance with the Public Safety Article, Section 2-514 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the Department of State Police (DSP) is required to report
the total number of crime scene DNA evidence samples submitted to the
Statewide DNA database (Database) by April 1 of every even-numbered year
for the preceding calendar year. As required by Section 2-502 of the Law,
DSP administers the Database and must ensure that DNA samples meet
certain State requirements prior to inclusion in the Database. Pursuant to the
aforementioned law, DSP reported that 1,004 crime scene DNA evidence
samples and 1,884 suspect DNA evidence samples were submitted and
qualified for inclusion during calendar year 2013. We reviewed the source of
the DSP reported figure and found the 2013 reported totals to be consistent
with DSP records.
Forensic Examination Collections by Hospitals
In accordance with the Public Safety Article, Section 2-514 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, DSP and the LLEAs are required to report the number of
crime scene DNA evidence samples related to sexual assault evidence
collected by hospitals by April 1 of every even-numbered year for the
preceding calendar year. The related State regulations clarified the law by
placing the reporting requirement on the Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene (DHMH) and by requiring DHMH to report the number of hospital
forensic examinations for which it reimbursed each jurisdiction in each odd-
numbered calendar year. Certain hospitals throughout the State are
authorized by DHMH to perform forensic examinations on sexual assault
victims. When a hospital performs these examinations, it may request and
receive reimbursement from DHMH for the costs associated with the
examinations. Based on records provided by DHMH pursuant to the
aforementioned law, in calendar year 2013 DHMH reimbursed hospitals in
each county and Baltimore City for sexual assault forensic examinations as
detailed in Table 6 on the following page. We reviewed the basis for the
reported data and found the reported total to be reasonable.

Note: This table is based on the location of the hospital that performed and was
reimbursed for the forensic examination. Not all subdivisions have a hospital that
performs forensic examinations. Sexual assault forensic examination information by
subdivision where the assault occurred and by hospital name is included in Exhibit 6.
In compiling the above data, DHMH reported reimbursements based on the
date forensic examinations were approved for reimbursement and not the
date forensic examinations were performed. Also, each forensic examination
relates to one patient.

Only 42 of the 45 LLEAs that reported at least one instance of collecting DNA crime scene evidence
during calendar year 2013 provided a specific number in the response to this question. For the
remaining 3, either the DNA analyses were not completed in calendar year 2013 (and therefore the
cases were reported in Item 4) or the LLEAs did not respond to the question.

Exhibit 5
GOCCP’s Web-based DNA Reporting Form
2014 Maryland Law Enforcement DNA Survey3
Reported Data Guidelines
I. DNA crime scene evidence sample is a case that includes one or more DNA crime scene
DNA evidence items.
II. A DNA crime scene evidence item includes one or more of the following:
a. Physical evidence (e.g., a sweat shirt, glove, or cigarette retrieved from the crime scene
and submitted to a crime lab for biological analysis);
b. A "rape kit";
c. Swabs from suspects or voluntarily provided swab samples.
III. IMPORTANT: The reported data should reflect the number of cases in which crime scene
DNA evidence was collected and submitted to a lab for biological analysis. Do not report a
count of individual items.
IV. Biological analysis is a submission of a DNA crime scene evidence item to a laboratory
for analysis including serology testing.
V. Collected and submitted to a crime laboratory for biological analysis is:
a. The date a DNA crime scene evidence item is sent from the police department’s
evidence holding area to a lab regardless of:
1. The current phase of laboratory analysis (serology vs. advanced testing)
2. Whether or not the evidence was probative to the case
3. This should include all evidence items, including those outsourced to private labs or
labs operated by other jurisdictions.
4. This should include those items submitted even when a subsequent determination that
no testing was required and the case was closed without performing serology or advanced
testing.
5. This should include cases where serology testing determined that further DNA
analysis was either not possible (e.g., due to a lack of materials to test) or warranted.
3 Although the term “survey” is used on the reporting form, the information is by law required to be provided.
40

--- Page 43 ---
Exhibit 5
GOCCP’s Web-based DNA Reporting Form
VI. IMPORTANT: Reported information shall include all cases in which crime scene DNA
evidence items were submitted to a lab regardless of whether the items were submitted to
a government or private lab for analysis
VII. For the purposes of this survey, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Original Case Submission: the initial submission of crime scene DNA evidence for
subsequent testing and reporting testing and reporting.
Supplemental Submission: an additional submission of crime scene DNA evidence prior to
the completion of the DNA analysis process for the original case submission.
Resubmission Case: an additional submission of crime scene DNA evidence after the
original case submission has been tested and the related report issued.
1. Check the corresponding box for each crime category in which DNA crime scene evidence
items are routinely collected and submitted to a crime laboratory for biological analysis.
(check all that apply)
2. Indicate the number of cases in which DNA crime scene evidence samples were collected
and submitted to a crime laboratory for biological analysis from January 1, 2013 through
December 31, 2013. Provide the number of cases that included evidence samples collected
and submitted for each crime category. This count should include original case submission,
supplemental submissions, and resubmission cases as follows:
41

--- Page 44 ---
Exhibit 5
GOCCP’s Web-based DNA Reporting Form
1. Original Case Submissions – Each submission should be counted each as one case if the
submission occurred during the reporting year
2. Supplemental Submissions – If the submission related to an original case submission
already counted above, the supplemental submission should not be counted. If the
supplemental submission occurred during the reporting year but relates to an original case
submission or resubmission case that occurred in a preceding year, count the first
supplemental submission (and any additional supplemental submissions in the reporting
year) as one case. For example, if the original case submission occurred in calendar year
2012 and three supplemental submissions were made in calendar year 2013 (the reporting
year), the LLEA should count this as one case.
3. Resubmission Cases – Each resubmission case should be counted as one case if the
evidence for the resubmission case was submitted during the reporting year regardless of
the year the related original case was submitted.
3. What was the average time between the date the agency submitted cases with DNA crime
scene evidence sample(s) for biological analysis and the date the agency received the DNA
analysis results back from the crime laboratory?
To calculate this, use DNA crime scene evidence samples that have completed DNA analysis
in CY 2013 regardless of when they were submitted to the lab for analysis. Determine the
number of days from the original biological analysis submission date* to the date the DNA
analysis results were returned to you. Total the number of days and divide by the number of
cases submitted to determine the average. Please report the result in number of days as a
single value (that is, do not give a range).
*The original biological analysis submission date should be determined as follows:
-ORIGINAL CASES use the date the evidence was first submitted. Supplemental submission
dates are not considered.
42

--- Page 45 ---
Exhibit 5
GOCCP’s Web-based DNA Reporting Form
-RESUBMISSION CASES use the date evidence was first submitted for biological analysis for
that resubmission case (and not the original case submission).
4. Identify the number of cases in which DNA crime scene evidence samples were submitted
for biological analysis prior to and including 2013, (by month of submission) for which a final
DNA analysis report has not been received from the lab, as of 12/31/2013.
This number will reflect the cases where DNA crime scene evidence samples that you
submitted to a laboratory for biological analysis in which you have not yet received the
results of the analysis. The purpose of this question is to determine if there is a case
backlog of DNA crime scene evidence sample analysis in Maryland, and if so, the size of
such backlog. (Note that this represents samples pending analysis as a snap shot at the
reporting date and will not be reflective of all casework handled by the police department
and related lab.)
