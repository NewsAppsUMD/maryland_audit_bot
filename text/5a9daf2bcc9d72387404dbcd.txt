Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2011 to November 30, 2011
1) Department of Human Resources – Child Support Enforcement Administration (CSEA)
(9/01/11 – 28 pages – 11 findings)
• CSEA did not utilize wage withholding orders to the fullest extent possible. We matched
a CSEA file of noncustodial parents who owed child support with a file from the
Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (DLLR) of employees with wages during
the third quarter of calendar 2010. This match identified 8,763 individuals with child
support arrearages totaling $88 million whose wages, which totaled $43 million in the
quarter, were not being garnished. Our tests of 22 of these accounts disclosed that, in
12 cases, wages should have been withheld.
• Although the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement had a process to notify CSEA
of noncustodial parents with wages, our tests disclosed that local offices were not
always following up on these notifications. Furthermore, the vendor who maintains the
State’s new hire registry did not ensure that employers reported all new hires, as
required.
• CSEA did not effectively use occupational license suspensions as an enforcement tool
for delinquent child support obligors. CSEA only obtained licensing data from 7 of the
15 licensing authorities permitted by State law and its matches of child support obligors
with licensing data were limited by a restrictive match design. Our match of CSEA
obligors with 10 licensing authorities identified 6,966 individuals with occupational
licenses that owed child support totaling $47 million. Our test of 25 disclosed that 17
were eligible for license suspensions.
• Although State law allows CSEA to seize the bank accounts of delinquent child support
obligors (that is, unpaid for more than 60 days) owing $500 or more, CSEA only seized
accounts of obligors that owed more than $2,500. We identified 25,550 cases with
account balances totaling $33.6 million that were not subject to bank garnishment
procedures because the account balances were between $500 and $2,500.
• CSEA did not have adequate procedures to ensure incorrect obligor social security
numbers recorded in its automated records were investigated and corrected.
• CSEA did not always review and process driver’s license suspension referrals rejected
by the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) because of system edits.
• Control deficiencies were noted with respect to various areas of CSEA’s operations,
including local office monitoring, payments to deceased individuals, contracts, and
computer access.

Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2011 to November 30, 2011
2) Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (DLLR) – Office of the Secretary –
Division of Administration – Division of Workforce Development and Adult Learning
(10/04/11 – 24 pages – 9 findings)
• The Office of Information Technology (OIT), within the Division of Administration,
operates and maintains a Department website that provides several online services.
Sensitive personal and financial information relating to unemployment insurance claims
submitted through the Department’s website and processed by DLLR’s Division of
Unemployment Insurance was not adequately protected. For example, files containing
sensitive personal and financial information, including names, social security numbers,
and dates of birth, transferred from the Annapolis Data Center to a DLLR server, were
not encrypted. These conditions were commented upon in our preceding audit report.
• Proper security measures were not established over the electronic licensing application
administered by the Divisions of Occupational and Professional Licensing and Financial
Regulation. For example, as commented upon in our preceding audit report,
appropriate controls were not established over the credit card service provider account
used to process occupational and professional license fees and personal information of
new licensees on the web server was not sufficiently protected.
• The electronic licensing application was not properly monitored or protected from
external threats. As commented upon in our preceding audit report, the website’s
logged activity was not reviewed to identify unusual activity. Furthermore, there were
unusually high levels of website traffic originating from suspicious sources that should
be investigated.
• Cash receipts of two DLLR offices, which totaled $1.2 million during fiscal year 2010,
were not adequately controlled. For example, certain collections were not restrictively
endorsed and recorded immediately upon receipt, and verifications of deposits were not
always performed or were not performed by personnel independent of the cash receipts
process.
• Internal control and record keeping deficiencies were noted with respect to DLLR’s
payroll and equipment. For example, individuals who approved online personnel
transactions and payroll adjustments did not review related supporting documentation
when doing so.

Significant Audit Findings
September 1, 2011 to November 30, 2011
3) Department of Transportation – State Highway Administration (SHA) – Construction
Inspection Services Contracts (Special) (11/21/11 – 13 pages – 5 findings)
• SHA and 10 architectural and engineering firms arranged to use unexpended balances
of contracts for construction inspection services to pay for work that was outside the
scope of those contracts. These arrangements circumvented State procurement
regulations which require a formal contract modification and Board of Public Works
(BPW) approval for a significant change in contract scope. Our review of invoices
totaling $70 million identified $11.3 million that was charged to 10 contracts for project
work that was unrelated to the applicable contracts. The arrangements made between
SHA and the firms are indicative of a less than arm’s-length relationship between those
parties that, in turn, could raise questions regarding the integrity of the procurement and
payment process for subsequent contracts involving these firms.
• SHA did not issue written task orders to formally assign work and to manage
construction inspection services contracts awarded to the firms because, according to
SHA personnel, it would be too cumbersome to do so for individual projects.
Consequently, SHA could not effectively monitor services provided by firms, as well as
the related charges billed by the firms.
• SHA extended contract terms without BPW approval. During the period from
September 2008 through August 2009, SHA improperly extended the contract
expiration dates for all nine construction inspection services contracts reviewed that had
expired, allowing SHA to retain approximately $26 million in unspent contract funds.
• SHA could not adequately document the basis for the maximum value of construction
inspection contracts submitted to the BPW for approval. Our test of four contract
awards, totaling $34 million and approved by the BPW, disclosed that SHA could not
adequately support the amount of funds that had been requested. For those four
contracts, the percentage of construction inspection contract values to related
construction costs ranged from 3 to 27 percent based on original estimates.
• SHA procured new construction inspection contracts when there were unspent funds
remaining on existing contracts.
