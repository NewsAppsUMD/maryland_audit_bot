Exhibit 3 to March 20, 2015 Letter to Joint Chairmen
OLA’s Assessment Regarding Repeat Findings That Had Not Been Resolved
Inmate Funds
Prior Report Recommendation – Finding 1a
We recommend that DPSCS, on a periodic basis, reconcile the aggregate balance of
individual inmate accounts in the Maryland Offender Banking System (MOBS) with the
corresponding records of the Comptroller of Maryland, including the investigation and
resolution of all differences (repeat).
Status: Not Resolved
As of February 20, 2015, the most recent reconciliation of the aggregate balance of individual
inmate accounts in MOBS with the corresponding Comptroller’s records was performed for July
2014 activity. DPSCS management advised that the last reconciliation was performed for July
2014 because it has been unable to obtain the financial activity reports needed to perform the
reconciliations since the replacement of MOBS with a newer version (MOBS II) in August 2014.
As a consequence, the present unreconciled difference is unknown.
In our August 6, 2012 audit report, OLA reported that the MOBS balance exceeded the related
Comptroller’s balance by approximately $309,000 as of June 30, 2011. DPSCS’s July 2014
reconciliation indicated that the MOBS balance exceeded the related Comptroller’s balance by
approximately $182,000. Although this represented an approximate $127,000 reduction in the
unreconciled difference, it includes the impact of a June 2014 transfer of $200,000 to the
Comptroller’s account that was made in accordance with the April 2013 Joint Chairmen’s
Report to reduce the difference. Prior to the transfer, and since the May 2013 reconciliation, the
monthly unreconciled difference had been $382,000.
