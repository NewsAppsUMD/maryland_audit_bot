Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with the provisions of the Education Article, Section 16-315(h) of
the Annotated Code of Maryland, we have reviewed the audit reports that must be
filed by 15 of the State’s community colleges with the Maryland Higher
Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
Our review disclosed that the community colleges and their independent auditors
substantially complied with the applicable statutes and the guidelines promulgated
by MHEC. Specifically, our review disclosed that all opinions expressed by the
colleges’ independent auditors stated that the applicable financial statements were
fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. However, we did note that five colleges had deficit
balances in unrestricted net position as of June 30, 2021.
The independent auditors reported no material weaknesses related to certain
compliance requirements for fiscal year 2021.

A draft copy of this report was provided to MHEC for review and comment.
Since there are no recommendations in this report, a written response was not
necessary.
Respectfully submitted,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Purpose of Review and Background Information
In accordance with the provisions of the Education Article, Section 16-315(h) of
the Annotated Code of Maryland, we have reviewed the audit reports that must be
filed by 15 of the State’s community colleges with the Maryland Higher
Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. We
reviewed these audit reports to determine compliance with the applicable statutes
and the guidelines promulgated by MHEC. We also reviewed the reports to
determine if any of the community colleges had deficit balances in unrestricted
net position, or uninsured/uncollateralized bank deposits. This report contains the
results of that review.
According to the State’s records, State aid totaling approximately $353.1 million
was granted to 15 of Maryland’s 16 community colleges for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2021. This aid primarily consisted of funding based on cost and student
enrollment data. In addition, it included certain retirement benefits and various
other grants. The sixteenth and remaining college (Baltimore City Community
College) is a budgetary unit of the State and receives an annual State
appropriation. Baltimore City Community College is not subject to the Education
Article, Section 16-315(h) of the Annotated Code of Maryland; however, it
obtains annual financial statement audits that are conducted by a certified public
accounting firm. The College is also subject to fiscal compliance audits by the
Office of Legislative Audits for which separate audit reports are issued.
The Education Article, Section 16-315(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires MHEC to adopt guidelines for the preparation of annual audit reports on
the colleges. The guidelines promulgated by MHEC as State regulations require
independent auditors to express opinions as to the fairness of presentation of the
colleges’ financial statements as well as of the cost and student enrollment data
used for calculating the State aid to the colleges. The guidelines also require the
auditors to issue management letters containing all material weaknesses in the
colleges’ systems of internal controls. While not required, many of the auditors
issue management letters that contain additional recommendations that were not
considered material weaknesses.

Results of Review
Audit Reports
Fourteen of the 15 audit reports for fiscal year 2021 were filed timely.
Our review disclosed that 14 of the 15 community college audit reports were filed
timely with the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2021. The one community college that submitted its audit
report after the required filing date was Hagerstown Community College, which
filed later than the date required by law and no extension was requested.
The State’s community colleges are required by law to file annual audit reports
within 90 days of the fiscal year end (June 30) unless an extension is granted.
All audit reports expressed unqualified opinions and were presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Our review disclosed that all 15 community college audit reports for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2021 contained unqualified opinions from their independent
auditors and were presented in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.
MHEC’s audit guidelines require the auditors to express opinions as to the
fairness of the presentation of the colleges’ financial statements and that the audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. An
unqualified opinion is issued when the auditor states that the applicable financial
statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Five community colleges’ financial statements disclosed deficit balances in
the unrestricted portion of their net position at June 30, 2021.
Our review disclosed five colleges with deficit balances in the unrestricted
component of their net position as of June 30, 2021.

Colleges with Deficit Unrestricted Balances as of June 30, 2021
Unrestricted Net Position
College
Deficit
Anne Arundel Community College $52,816,612
Community College of Baltimore County $103,672,641
Carroll Community College $12,618,235
Montgomery College $35,670,026
Prince George’s Community College $15,043,979
This situation was also noted in the financial statements for Anne Arundel
Community College, Community College of Baltimore County, and Carroll
Community College for each fiscal year since 2011, 2016, and 2009, respectively.
Montgomery College and Prince George’s Community College have each had a
deficit unrestricted balance since fiscal year 2018. An unrestricted net position
deficit balance represents the cost of current or past services that will need to be
financed in the future periods and could indicate a potential financial problem.
We did not perform a detailed analysis to determine the cause of these deficits;
nevertheless, the colleges’ financial statements and accompanying notes
contained certain pertinent information relative to the deficits. Specifically, our
review of the colleges’ financial statements disclosed that the unrestricted net
position could be attributed at least in part to other postemployment benefit
liabilities, which at June 30, 2021 totaled $93 million for Anne Arundel
Community College; $188.2 million for the Community College of Baltimore
County; $28.2 million for Carroll Community College; $75.1 million for
Montgomery College; and $3.6 million for Prince George’s Community College.
Generally accepted accounting principles specify that liabilities for
postemployment benefits (such as healthcare benefits), which are deferred until
retirement or another future event, be recognized in the years in which the
employee provides services rather than during the postemployment period when
payments are made.

Management Letters and Compliance
Management letters for fiscal year 2021 included a total of 12
recommendations for improvement related to 6 colleges’ compliance with
requirements.
We reviewed the management letters applicable to the audits of the community
colleges that were filed with MHEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, and
found 6 received recommendations related to issues deemed to be non-material
deficiencies. Specifically, our review disclosed that 9 of the community colleges
did not receive any recommendations; the remaining 6 community colleges
received a total of 12 recommendations.
MHEC was not required to formally evaluate the adequacy of the colleges’
responses to the 12 recommendations since, in accordance with MHEC’s
guidelines, comments and suggestions related to these non-material deficiencies
are not required. When an independent auditor includes such items in the letter,
the college’s follow-up actions are subject to the auditor’s review during
subsequent audits.
The following schedule provides a summary of the fiscal year 2021
recommendations by fiscal area. Two of the 12 recommendations were repeated
from the preceding year.
