AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Continue to Develop and Implement Information Security Policies and Procedures
Type: Internal Control and Compliance
Repeat: Yes (First Issued in 2019)
Potomac River Fisheries Commission (Commission) has adopted the Commonwealth Information
Security Standard SEC 501 (Security Standard) to follow in implementing its information security
program. The Commission contracted with the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) for VITA
to provide required Information Security Officer services, such as developing a business impact analysis
and a system security plan; however, to date, VITA has not provided any services. Due to a lack of
communication between VITA and the Commission with respect to a timeframe for the contract
deliverables, the Commission continues to lack documented and approved information security policies
and procedures.
The Security Standard requires specific policies and procedures regarding access, security
awareness and training, systems audits and accountability, security assessment and authorization,
system configuration, contingency planning, identification and authentication, incident response,
system maintenance, physical and environmental protection, planning and risk assessment, and system
integrity. Industry best practices suggest that entities prepare, disseminate, and maintain information
security policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures to facilitate effective implementation of an
information security program.
The Commission has taken the first step by contracting with VITA to provide required information
security services. The Commission should continue to be proactive in communicating with VITA to obtain
the contract deliverables, including resources to develop and formally approve information security
policies and procedures and implement them into its information security program. Implementing
information security policies and procedures will help to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of data and achieve compliance with the Security Standard.
Ensure Timely Updates of Disaster Recovery Plan
Type: Internal Control and Compliance
Repeat: No
The Commission has not updated its Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) since establishing the original
plan in 2019. Since the initial plan, the Commission has made significant changes to equipment and
software and has changed information technology (IT) contractors but has not investigated a timeframe
for equipment replacement should a disaster occur. The Executive Secretary was unaware of the
requirements for updating the DRP each time the Commission performs continuity of operations (COOP)
testing.
The Security Standard, Section 8.6, CP-1 – COV-2, requires annual review, reassessment, testing,
and revision of the DRP to reflect changes in mission essential functions, services, IT system hardware
and software, and personnel. A current disaster recovery plan is essential to ongoing operations in the
1

event of a catastrophic event, and the Commission should update its plan each year during COOP testing.
The Commission should also reassess its pre-determined recovery time for updated or replaced
equipment during COOP testing.
The lack of a current DRP increases the risk that, in the event of a disaster, the Commission will
not accurately replace mission-critical systems currently in use, which could affect the Commission’s
ability to generate revenue, cause a permanent loss of records, and result in a long-term reduction in
productivity. The Executive Secretary should ensure that he is familiar with the Security Standard
requirements. The Commission should update its DRP to include current equipment and software with
realistic replacement timeframes. The Commission should review and update the DRP each time it
performs COOP testing.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and improve the fishery
resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s leadership consists of eight
Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
When compared to the previous fiscal year, Commission revenues increased by 34 percent;
expenses increased by 95 percent; and net income decreased overall by 137 percent. The Commission’s
revenue increase was due primarily to federal grant activity. For two grants, the Commission received
and spent the revenues for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 during fiscal year 2022. In addition, the
Commission received a new federal grant for development and implementation of an online reporting
system. Expense increases and the net income decrease were primarily due to the federal grant activity
noted above and the new oyster plantings during fiscal year 2022 that did not occur in fiscal year 2021.

Fiscal Year
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission closed fiscal year 2022 with an overall cash balance of $1,291,754, which was a
5 percent or $70,376 decrease, over fiscal year 2021 levels. The cash balance includes $694,552 in the
Virginia and Maryland local government investment pool accounts to fund future oyster work and
supplement operating expenses, $536,637 in a separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree
health care reserves, and $60,565 in its operating bank accounts. The retiree healthcare account is
managed by a trust and legally cannot be used to fund operations. The Commission earmarked funds
for the Oyster Management Reserve and Rotational Oyster Harvest programs, and the Commission no
longer uses these reserves to supplement operating cash. As shown in Chart 2, as of June 30, 2022, the
Commission’s operating cash coverage remains at a positive rate of 6.4 months coverage of operating
expenses (assuming expenses continue at the current rate) as the Commission continues to restrict
contributions to the oyster programs.

The Honorable Glenn Youngkin
Governor of Virginia
Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
Commissioners
Potomac River Fisheries Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2022. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commission’s financial system; review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls; test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and review corrective
actions of audit findings from the prior year report.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances.

We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also tested details of
transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The financial information presented in this report
came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted two matters involving internal control and its operation and compliance with
applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements that require management’s attention and
corrective action. These matters are described in the section titled “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.”
The Commission has not completed corrective action with respect to the audit finding reported
in the prior year.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on October 31, 2022. Management’s response to
the findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did not
audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
