Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Child Support Enforcement Administration
(CSEA) operates a statewide child support
program that includes:
(cid:131) Establishment of paternity and child support
orders
(cid:131) Collection of support payments
(cid:131) Distribution of funds collected
(cid:190) Local child support offices, other state and local
government agencies, and private contractors
perform child support services.
(cid:190) Collections during FY 2007 totaled $496 million,
an increase of $43 million from FY 2004.
(cid:190) Unpaid support obligations at September 2007
totaled $1.57 billion, an increase of $110 million
over a 3-year period.
(cid:190) Although issues still exist (15 findings included 9
repeats), CSEA’s audit accountability and
compliance level has improved since last audit.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Certain available enforcement procedures were not
used or were not used effectively to maximize
collections.
(cid:190) A process was not in place to identify payments to
being issued to deceased custodial parties. Our
match to DHMH death records found in excess of
$300,000 made to deceased individuals, some of
which continued for extended periods.
(cid:190) $1.1 million in undisbursed funds were not
forwarded to the State Comptroller as required by
State law.
(cid:190) CSEA did not determine the proper distribution of
$2.4 million transferred from a local office bank
account to its central bank account.
(cid:190) CSEA did not take sufficient action when contractors
did not comply with certain contract terms.

Enforcement Procedures
(cid:190) Suspension of occupational licenses was not used
as an enforcement tool. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) Upon CSEA’s request, State law requires 14
State licensing authorities, such as the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, to
suspend occupational licenses of delinquent
obligors.
(cid:131) OLA computer matches identified 5,283
individuals with occupational licenses who
owed delinquent child support totaling $47
million.
(cid:131) 11 of 20 individuals tested had not made any
recent payments and had delinquent child
support totaling $206,147 that were in arrears
for more than 120 days. The other 9 were
making some payments.

Enforcement Procedures
(cid:190) Comprehensive procedures were not in place to
ensure that valid social security numbers (SSN)
were on file for all obligors. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) Follow-up was not conducted to ensure that
local offices investigated all reported cases of
missing SSNs. For example, one local office
only investigated 6% of 1,662 cases without
SSNs on a February 2007 report.
(cid:131) A process was not in place to verify the
accuracy of SSNs that were recorded on the
automated child support system.

Enforcement Procedures (continued)
(cid:190) CSEA was not identifying or seizing funds in
certain obligor bank accounts to satisfy
delinquent child support balances. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) Since July 2005, CSEA had not identified bank
accounts held by delinquent obligors in State-
chartered banks.
(cid:131) Our limited test found that CSEA was not
taking adequate actions on obligors with
accounts in federally-chartered banks
identified by the federal child support agency.
Six of ten individuals selected for testing had
$139,000 in funds available for seizure that
were not pursued by CSEA.

Enforcement Procedures (continued)
(cid:190) CSEA did not adequately investigate driver’s
license suspension referrals rejected by MVA.
During FY 2007, there were 14,751 rejected
referrals, which could include multiple referrals
for a single individual. CSEA management
advised that many of these were not pursued.
(Finding 4)
(cid:131) OLA’s limited review of 14 rejections
identified 9 rejections for which obligors
owed $120,000 in child support and MVA
match criteria indicated possible matches.
(cid:131) CSEA advised that improvements to the
match with MVA were implemented, and that
fewer rejections are anticipated
.

Payments to Deceased Individuals
(cid:190) CSEA did not have an effective process in place
to identify payments issued to deceased
individuals, who were custodial parties.
(Finding 7)
(cid:131) OLA matched CSEA records to the death
records registry maintained by the
Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene’s Division of Vital Records.
(cid:131) OLA match identified payments totaling
$334,000 during fiscal years 2006 and
2007 made to 576 deceased individuals.
(cid:131) A limited OLA examination of payments to
20 individuals after date of death found
that checks totaling $152,000 for 13
individuals had been negotiated 12 to 96
months after the payee’s death. Checks
for the other 7 had not been cashed.

Undisbursed Funds
(cid:190) CSEA did not forward undisbursed funds to
the Comptroller of the Treasury, as required by
State law. (Finding 8)
(cid:131) Undisbursed funds occur when a child
support check is returned to CSEA (e.g.,
custodial parent moves) or collections
can’t be matched with a child support
case.
(cid:131) As of August 2007, CSEA was holding
approximately $1.1 million in funds that
had been undisbursed for over four years.

Bank Accounts
(cid:190) In February 2006, CSEA transferred $2.4
million from a local office’s bank account,
representing collections made prior to 2000,
and retained these funds in its central
disbursement account without determining
the proper distribution. (Finding 9)
(cid:190) CSEA could not document $825,000 of a
$2.1 million reduction to the cash balance in
its central disbursement account that was
commented upon during the prior audit.
(Finding 10)

Contract Monitoring
(cid:190) CSEA could not document that it adequately
monitored the operations of the contractor
responsible for the collections of $414 million
in FY 2007 to ensure adequate controls and
safeguards were in place. (Finding 11)
(cid:190) CSEA contracts with 36 government agencies
to perform certain child support services, which
are generally on a cost-reimbursement basis;
however, CSEA did not verify the accuracy of
related billings nor take action when contractor
performance was below established goals.
During FY 2007, these agencies were paid
approximately $10 million. (Finding 12)

Contract Monitoring
(cid:190) CSEA did not take sufficient action when the
contractor hired to operate two local child
support offices did not comply with contract
requirements. (Finding 13)
(cid:131) Monitoring reports for certain quarters in
2006 and 2007 noted that 67% to 80% of
cases were noncompliant with CSEA
collection policies, yet no penalties were
assessed or corrective action plans
required.
(cid:131) The estimated cost of the contract is
$58.6 million for approximately 6 years
(including renewal options).

Other Findings
(cid:190) Controls over access to critical data in the
automated child support enforcement system
were not comprehensive. For example, 12 of 24
employees tested with the capability to modify
critical account information, did not need such
access to perform their duties. (Finding 14)
(cid:190) CSEA did not always perform adequate collection
efforts for funds it was owed related to cancelled
federal income tax intercepts, which should have
been forwarded to the State’s Central Collection
Unit for further collection efforts. (Finding 15)

Conclusion
CSEA needs to:
(cid:190) Maximize and improve the use of all available
collection enforcement tools;
(cid:190) Establish effective procedures for identifying
payments being made to deceased individuals;
(cid:190) Ensure undisbursed funds are forwarded to
the State Comptroller as required by State law;
(cid:190) Investigate the composition of funds
transferred to its central bank account; and
(cid:190) Ensure contractors comply with contract
terms, and improve controls in other areas.
