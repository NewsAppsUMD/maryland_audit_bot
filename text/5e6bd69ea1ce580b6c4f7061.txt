Title: University of Maryland Medical System Corporation - Board of Directors Activities


CORRECTION: Subsequent to the issuance of the University of Maryland Medical System Corporation – Board of Directors Activities report dated March 13, 2020, it was noted that disbursements to Vendor 12E as reported on page 48 ($91,617) were overstated by $76,617, while the disbursements to Vendor 12F reported on page 49 ($696,172) were understated by the same amount.  Thus, the correct information for Vendor 12E is 3 disbursements for $15,000, and for Vendor 12F is 231 disbursements for $772,789.  Also, footnote 17 on page 48 was associated with Vendor 12E but should have been associated with Vendor 12F.

Background Information
University of Maryland Medical System Corporation
Responsibilities
The University of Maryland Medical System Corporation (UMMS) provides
inpatient and outpatient medical care, education, community health services, and
emergency medical treatment through an integrated network of hospitals and
related clinical enterprises. Chapter 288, Laws of Maryland 1984 converted what
until then was the University of Maryland Hospital to UMMS, a private, nonprofit
corporation. Through that legislation, the General Assembly ensured that the
State would continue to play a prominent role in UMMS’ governance by requiring
that the voting members of the Board of Directors be appointed by the Governor.
During fiscal years 2016 through
2020, the State provided

billion, respectively, and its income
from continuing operations for fiscal year 2019 totaled $78.8 million.
Disclosure of Business Relationships Between UMMS and Certain
Members of its Board of Directors
Beginning in March 2019, several articles were published by certain news
sources, describing financial relationships between UMMS and 10 members of its
Board of Directors. In these news articles, it was reported that UMMS had made
significant payments to these Board members and their businesses for goods and
services including payments for children’s books, employee benefits
administration, consulting, pest control, banking, and civil engineering.
7

--- Page 10 ---
Emergency Legislation
During the 2019 Legislative Session, the Maryland General Assembly passed
emergency legislation (Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019) that
addressed the financial relationships between UMMS and its Board of Directors.
In addition, this legislation required the Office of Legislative Audits to conduct a
forensic audit of UMMS for the period from January 1, 2016 through April 18,
2019 (the effective date of the legislation) that
 identifies all of the members of the Board of Directors and each member’s
associated businesses;
 identifies all contracts with or payments to Board members and their
associated businesses;
 evaluates the procurement of each contract and payment identified and
assesses how effectively they were monitored to ensure that all deliverables
paid for were received; and
 makes recommendations regarding how best to evaluate the procurement and
contracting processes and any contracts with and payments to UMMS
affiliated hospitals and members of the UMMS Board of Directors or the
members of the boards of directors of the affiliated hospitals.
Basically, the laws included provisions requiring the Office of Legislative Audits
to identify and review related transactions between past Board members and
UMMS, and to recommend any necessary improvements in procurement and
disbursement processing, which would be of use to the newly appointed Board in
its governance of UMMS. The laws required the Office to report its findings to
various State officials identified in the legislation, by December 15, 2019. In
October 2019, the Legislative Auditor requested an extension from the
Presiding Officers of the Maryland General Assembly for submitting the report
due to delays encountered during the review process (see Exhibit 1 for a copy of
the extension request letter). In response to the request, the Presiding Officers
extended the submission deadline for the report to March 13, 2020 (see Exhibit 2
for a copy of extension request approval letter).
Chapters 18 and 19 also contained numerous provisions related to the governance
of UMMS, but primarily established new requirements over Board of Directors
membership, conflicts of interest, including payments from UMMS to a Board
member, and certain reporting requirements to State government officials.
Specifically, the Chapters made changes to State law regarding the composition of
the Board, including reducing the number of voting members from 27 to 25,
requiring the advice and consent of the Senate for voting members appointed by
the Governor, and excluding State and local elected officials from serving on the
8

--- Page 11 ---
Board. UMMS was also required to adopt a conflict of interest policy for the
Board, impose certain restrictions on awarding contracts to a Board member or a
member’s associated business, and requires each Board member to file annual
financial disclosures with the Health Services Cost Review Commission1.
Finally, Chapters 18 and 19 required UMMS to contract with an independent
certified public accounting firm to conduct a performance audit of its financial
management practices (including procurement and contracting). UMMS was also
required to conduct an independent internal review of the Board’s policies and
procedures for enforcing statutory limits on consecutive terms and continued
service after the expiration of the member’s term.
1 Prior to this law change, State regulations only required such disclosures for officers and
directors who were an employee, partner, director, or beneficial owner of three percent or more
of the capital account or stock of a partnership, firm, corporation, or any business entity with
which UMMS had engaged in a transaction of $10,000 or more during the previous fiscal year.

Findings and Recommendations
Objective 1
Identify All Members of the University of Maryland Medical
System Board of Directors
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to identify all of the individuals who served as members of the
University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) Board of Directors during the
period from January 1, 2016 through April 18, 2019.
During the period covered by our review, Section 13-304 of the Education Article
of the Annotated Code of Maryland provided that the Board shall consist of
between 22 and 27 voting members appointed by the Governor and 6 nonvoting
ex-officio members. As noted in Table 2, the law specified the 6 ex-officio
members and 7 of the voting members. In addition, the existing law limited
voting members to two consecutive five-year terms, but allowed the members to
continue serving beyond this term until a successor had been appointed.

To identify all of the individuals who served on the UMMS Board of Directors
between January 1, 2016 and April 18, 2019, we obtained a list of individuals
appointed to the Board of Directors and their terms of service from both the
Governor’s Appointments Office and UMMS. To corroborate this information,
we compiled our own list using a variety of sources including Board minutes,
Internal Revenue Service Form 990s, UMMS Annual Reports, the UMMS
website (as of May 28, 2019), and a questionnaire that we mailed to each Board
10

--- Page 13 ---
member in June 20192. For the purpose of our review, we only considered
individuals to be a Board member if they had been appointed by the Governor as
of May 28, 2019 or if they served in an ex-officio capacity. We did not attempt to
identify members of the boards of directors for any of the UMMS affiliated
hospitals, nor did we assess whether the terms served by the Board members we
identified were in compliance with statutory limits.
Section 4 of Chapter 18, Laws of Maryland 2019, required the UMMS Board of
Directors to conduct an internal review of its policies and procedures for
enforcing statutory limits on consecutive terms of appointments for Board
members and continued service after the expiration of a member’s term. On
December 13, 2019, the Board of Directors reported the results of its review to the
Governor, the General Assembly, and our Office. As required by Section 4 of
Chapter 18, we will comment on this report to the Joint Audit and Evaluation,
Senate Finance, and House Health and Government Operations Committees in the
near future.
Conclusion
We identified 47 individuals who served on the UMMS Board of Directors during
the period from January 1, 2016 through April 18, 2019 (see Table 3 below). We
believe that these individuals represent the totality of UMMS Board members
serving at some point during this period. As noted in Table 3, there were
inconsistencies between the terms of service for many Board members reported
by the Governor’s Appointments Office, UMMS, and the individual members.
While there are plausible explanations for many of these variances, such as
UMMS using the date provided in statute for member terms3 and the Governor’s
Appointments Office using the actual date of appointment, this would not
adequately explain certain of the inconsistencies in Table 3. For example, the
start date reflected in UMMS records for Mr. Francis X. Kelly, Jr. was June 2016,
whereas Mr. Kelly advised us that he has been a Board member since 1984 and,
according to the Governor’s Appointments Office he had been on the Board since
June 1986. In another instance, UMMS records show the term served by Ms.
Catherine E. Pugh ended in June 2005, despite the fact that other records
indicated she was a Board member until March 2019.
Determining the correct term(s) was not within the scope of this review, and given
the occasional significantly divergent dates, we did not attempt to reconcile the
2 Two of the Board members were not sent a questionnaire because they were deceased and four
other Board members either declined or failed to respond to our request.
3 Section 13-304(d) of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland provides that the
term of a member begins on the first Monday in June of the year of appointment.

differing terms noted for certain Board members. Nevertheless, all payments
identified in Objective 2 and 3, to any of the 47 individuals, did occur during the
period from January 1, 2016 through April 18, 2019, although not necessarily
during a Board member’s definitive term of service.

Objective 2
Identify All Contracts With or Payments to UMMS Board
Members and their Associated Businesses
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to identify all contracts with or payments to members of the
UMMS Board of Directors and their associated businesses during the period from
January 1, 2016 through April 18, 2019.
To accomplish this objective, we performed a four-step process, as depicted in
Figure 1. Specifically, we researched the 47 UMMS Board members we
identified in Objective 1 to identify each member’s associated businesses. We
also obtained an understanding of UMMS’ procedures for procuring contracts and
processing vendor payments and obtained copies of certain UMMS disbursement
records for the period from January 1, 2016 through April 18, 2019. We then
performed electronic data matches between the Board members and their
associated businesses and the disbursement records to identify Board members
and their associated businesses that received payments from UMMS.

Definition of Associated Businesses
Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019 do not define the “associated
businesses” that were to be identified by our review. Therefore, we included any
entity, regardless of whether it operated as for-profit or not-for-profit, with which
the Board members or their immediate family member4 (a) held an ownership
interest (excluding non-controlling interests in publicly traded stock), (b) was
employed, (c) received income, or (d) served as a member of the entity’s board of
4 We defined an immediate family member as a spouse or adult child.
14

--- Page 17 ---
directors or equivalent governing body. We did not include State agencies,
UMMS affiliates (such as its affiliated hospitals and its self-funded malpractice
insurance program), and entities through which members served on the board of
directors in an ex-officio capacity.
Identifying Associated Businesses
To identify the associated businesses for each Board member, we reviewed
various public records (such as, UMMS tax returns and public records databases),
as well as certain nonpublic records available to us under Section 2-1223 of the
State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. We also reviewed
various financial disclosure statements filed by certain Board members with the
Health Services Cost Review Commission, the State Ethics Commission5, and the
Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics of the Maryland General Assembly.
Additionally, in June 2019, we mailed a questionnaire (see Exhibit 3) to each of
the 45 living Board members requesting them to disclose:
1) any relationships that they or an immediate family member had with any
entities that conducted business with UMMS;
2) any business entities in which they or an immediate family member had an
ownership interest;
3) their employers; and
4) any entities (including nonprofits) for which they served as an officer or
board member during the period between January 1, 2016 and April 18,
2019.
Generally, the associated business entities that we identified were also reported by
the Board members in their responses to our June 2019 questionnaire. However,
certain associated business entities that received payments from UMMS during
the period of our review were not disclosed by the related Board members. As
explained more extensively in Objective 3, we could not definitively determine
the extent to which the Board members were involved in UMMS procurements
from or payments to those entities. In addition, we did not attempt to interview
the Board members or contact those entities to address any inconsistencies
between the business entities they disclosed and those we identified.
Accordingly, it is plausible that the Board members may not have had knowledge
of the relationships.
5 UMMS Board members do not file financial disclosures with the State Ethics Commission in
their capacity as members of the UMMS Board of Directors. However, certain Board members
were required to file disclosures because they concurrently held a position subject to the
reporting requirements of Maryland Public Ethics Law (for example, Board members who were
elected officials).
15

--- Page 18 ---
UMMS Procurement and Disbursement Records
UMMS did not maintain a comprehensive list of vendor contracts and its internal
policies and procedures did not require the existence of an executed contract to
process payments to a vendor. Therefore, we had to rely on UMMS disbursement
records to identify payments to Board members and their associated businesses.
As a result, this review would not identify contracts between UMMS and Board
members or their associated businesses for which no payments were made during
the period subject to our review.
We inquired with UMMS as to how it processed vendor disbursements and were
advised that these disbursements were primarily processed using several
automated accounts payable systems, corporate credit cards, and bank wire
transfers. We obtained seven datasets of these disbursements from UMMS,
which contained a total of approximately 2.2 million records related to $13.7
billion in payments processed between January 1, 2016 and April 18, 2019 (see
Table 4).

Data Reliability and Completeness
For the purpose of completing this objective, we obtained copies of the requested
disbursement datasets from UMMS and conducted certain limited procedures to
ensure the data were accurate and reliable for use in the data matches we
performed. Specifically, we compared (on a test basis) individual transactions
contained in the data to the related supporting documentation (for example,
vendor invoices and credit card statements).
We also attempted to verify that the datasets were complete by agreeing the
transactions contained in each dataset to an independent record, such as a check
register or bank statement. However, the aforementioned procedures were not
designed to detect data that UMMS may have modified or deleted prior to
16

--- Page 19 ---
providing the datasets to us. In addition, as noted above, UMMS did not maintain
a comprehensive list of contracts. Consequently, we could not reasonably assess
the completeness of the disbursement data provided to us by UMMS.
Nevertheless, we used this data to attempt to meet (to the extent possible) the
requirements of the aforementioned statute.
Data Matches
We conducted automated data matches between the Board members, their
immediate family members, and associated businesses we identified and the
UMMS disbursement records. Our match criteria6 included entities with the same
taxpayer identification number, same or similar name, and same or similar
address as a Board member, an immediate family member, or an associated
business. We then used several algorithms to identify entities in UMMS’
disbursement records with a similar name or address to an associated business.
For example, the algorithms calculated a score between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (an
exact match) to each entity name in the disbursement records. Any entities with a
score higher than 0.90 were subject to further review.
We then manually reviewed the match results for all Board members, immediate
family members, and entities that received at least $5,000 from UMMS during the
period under review. We also verified that the entities were the same entity that
we determined was an associated business of a Board member or an immediate
family member. Our data matches identified certain disbursements, such as de
minimis travel reimbursements and overpayment refunds related to medical care
provided by a UMMS facility, that were excluded from our review.
Other Activity
During the course of our review, we identified additional relationships that were
not identified by the aforementioned data matches. For example, we noted one
entity that received compensation that was not reflected in the datasets we
obtained. This activity will be further explained in Objective 3.
Conclusion
We identified approximately $114.9 million in payments made by UMMS to 27
Board members or their associated businesses between January 1, 2016 and April
18, 2019 (see Table 5). This amount may include payments which were
subsequently passed on to other entities. For example, the payments made to an

disbursement record. For example, the wire transfer data we obtained did not contain taxpayer
identification numbers or addresses but included entity names which were used in our data
matches.

associated business for employee benefits administration included insurance
premiums that were subsequently paid to individual insurance companies.
Approximately 94 percent ($108.2 million) of these payments were made either
directly to a Board member or to an entity with which the Board member (or
immediate family member) had a direct financial relationship. The remaining
$6.7 million was paid to 19 entities that met our criteria for an associated
business, but for which we did not identify a direct financial relationship between
the members and the entities (for example, UMMS Board members who also
served on the boards of non-profit entities).
The listing of Board members and associated businesses (Table 5) is intended to
provide a comprehensive summary of the payments identified by our review, and
not to establish that the Board members were aware of, involved in, or benefited
from the payments, nor that the transactions were improper. Further information
regarding our assessment of the procurements and related monitoring efforts for
these payments is included in Objective 3. In consideration of advice obtained
from legal counsel to the Maryland General Assembly and consistent with our
longstanding practice, the names of the Board members and associated businesses
that we determined received payments from UMMS are not included in our
report. Although names are not disclosed in this report, we did share that
information with UMMS.

Objective 3
Assess Procurements of Contracts With, and Payments to, UMMS
Board Members and their Associated Businesses
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to assess UMMS’ procurement of goods and services from
members of its Board of Directors and their associated businesses as provided in
Section 3(a)(4) through (7) of Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019.
Specifically, the law required the Office of Legislative Audits to:
 identify the basis for the procurement and the UMMS official and department
that initiated and approved the payment;
 identify the procurement method used and test the propriety of the
procurement, including whether it was conducted in accordance with a formal
UMMS policy and whether the full Board of Directors approved the contract
or payment;
 evaluate whether all proper steps were taken and, if a payment or contract was
sole source, whether the rationale was documented and supportable; and
 evaluate whether the contract or payment made to a member of the Board or
their associated business was effectively monitored to ensure that all
deliverables paid for were received.
To accomplish this objective, we obtained an understanding of UMMS
procurement policies and procedures and the monitoring of disbursements for the
related procurements. We then performed a test of each Board member and
associated businesses that received payments from UMMS during the period of
our review that were identified under Objective 2.
UMMS Procurement Policy
UMMS’ procurement policy provided that procurements were generally to be
conducted centrally by its Supply Chain Management department. However, we
were advised by UMMS management that affiliated hospitals were not required to
follow this policy and could independently conduct procurements. In this regard,
our testing disclosed that the procurements of services from Board members’
associated business entities were initiated by the UMMS Supply Chain
Management department and various UMMS affiliates.
UMMS’ procurement policy provided for all purchasing to be conducted in a
competitive manner with limited exceptions to ensure that the organization
received the best value for its requirements. The policy did not provide any dollar
thresholds for when competitive procurement was required (in other words,
20

--- Page 23 ---
exempting procurements of minimal dollar amount from this requirement).
However, the policy provided four exceptions to the use of competitive
procurement including (a) items available through a group purchasing contract;
(b) sole source purchases with approved justification; (c) no known alternate
source; and (d) instances in which UMMS management determined to be more
advantageously acquired through a negotiated purchase.
In regard to sole source procurements, we noted that UMMS did not define a sole
source procurement as there being only one vendor available to provide the good
or service (consistent with State procurement regulations). Rather, sole source
was used to describe situations in which UMMS only solicited one vendor for the
procurement. In addition, although the policy required an approved justification,
it did not specify what types of justification were acceptable, nor how these
justifications were to be documented and approved. There was no policy
requiring written justification or explanation, when the other three exceptions
from competition were utilized in a procurement.
UMMS’ policy also did not establish, or otherwise provide guidance on, which
employees were authorized to initiate procurements and execute vendor contracts.
Additionally, the policy did not require UMMS to obtain approval from the Board
of Directors, or identify circumstances when Board approval would be required
(such as contracts exceeding a certain dollar threshold), to award contracts or
process payments, including for contracts involving Board members and their
associated businesses. Furthermore, UMMS did not have a formal policy for
selecting entities to receive charitable donations or sponsorships or for
determining the dollar amounts to be paid to these entities. We were advised that
these payments were made at UMMS management’s discretion (exclusive of the
Board’s input) to selected entities if, among other factors, the payments advanced
UMMS’ overall mission, provided a community benefit, or provided a service
related to a community health need.
Test Methodology
We analyzed the UMMS disbursement records that we obtained during Objective
2 to select payments made to each Board member and their associated business
for testing. As noted in Objective 2, UMMS did not have comprehensive records
of procurements, and we could not readily associate disbursements to a particular
contract (procurement). As a result, we requested UMMS to identify the contracts
associated with each disbursement and the employees responsible for procuring
the contract and monitoring the related payments for vendor compliance with
contract terms and conditions (including deliverables). When provided, we
reviewed the related contracts, procurement documents, invoices, and other
21

--- Page 24 ---
documentation, as we deemed necessary. We also interviewed the employees
who UMMS was able to identify as being involved in the procurement and
monitoring of these entities, as well as certain former UMMS management
officials.
UMMS advised us that its contractual relationships with certain of the Board
members and their associated businesses originated prior to the period covered by
our review. In these instances, we obtained procurement documentation to the
extent that it was available, but generally limited our review to the most recent
contract that had been awarded to the Board members and associated businesses
with the Board members or their immediate family.
Table 5 in Objective 2 includes all payments identified by us from UMMS to a
Board member or an associated business entity (referred to as a “vendor”).
Ultimately, we tested 231 disbursements (out of 7,969 disbursements) totaling
approximately $12.9 million of the $114.9 million we identified as having been
disbursed by UMMS directly to Board members or associated businesses. Of this
amount, 168 disbursements totaling $10.8 million were payments to a Board
member or to a vendor/entity in which the Board member held a direct financial
interest7. The remaining 63 disbursements tested (totaling $2.1 million) related to
payments made by UMMS to 19 associated business entities for which we did not
identify a direct financial relationship between the Board members and the
entities.
Due to delays in obtaining requested documentation from UMMS and in
consideration of the timeframe for completing our review (both of which are
described more fully in the Scope, Objectives, and Methodology section of this
report) we did not test two business entities associated with three Board members.
Specifically, our testing was limited to payments reflected in three of the seven
datasets we obtained8, which accounted for 92 percent ($12.7 billion) of the total
UMMS disbursement activity ($13.7 billion) over the period of our review –
January 1, 2016 through April 18, 2019 (see Table 4). Accordingly, one business
entity associated with Board Members 5 and 9 and another business entity
associated with Board Member 21 were not tested. Therefore, items selected for
testing included 35 of the 37 entities in which a Board member held a direct
financial interest as identified in Table 5. The two entities not tested received
7 We considered an ownership interest or the receipt of compensation from a business as a
financial interest.
8 The other four datasets reflected disbursements processed by the Upper Chesapeake Health
System, Capital Region Medical Center, and the Charles Regional Medical Center.
22

--- Page 25 ---
payments from UMMS totaling approximately $2.7 million and $150,000,
respectively during the period of our review.
Generally, payments were selected for testing based on auditor judgment, which
primarily considers risk and significance. Neither statistical nor non-statistical
sampling were used to select our test items; therefore, the results of the tests we
performed under this objective cannot be projected to the entire population from
which the test items were selected.
Conclusion
Overall, we identified a lack of competitive procurement, effective monitoring of
the related payments, and adequate documentation. In addition, we could not
definitively determine the extent to which the Board members were involved in
the procurement of these contracts and the related payments or the extent to which
the full Board was aware of this activity.
Lack of Competitive Procurement and Support
Our testing disclosed that UMMS generally did not competitively procure
goods and services provided by Board members and their associated
businesses. UMMS could not provide documented justifications for not
competitively procuring certain vendors and could not document that
consideration was given to periodically conducting a new competitive
procurement for associated businesses with which UMMS had long-standing
financial relationships.
Lack of Effective Monitoring and Documentation to Support Payments
Our testing also disclosed that UMMS generally lacked adequate
documentation to support that it had effectively monitored its financial
activity and relationships with the Board members and their associated
businesses. UMMS frequently could not provide evidence that deliverables
were received and that payments were in accordance with the related
contracts. For example, we were advised by several UMMS employees, who
nominally approved payments, that they routinely processed payments at the
direction of their supervisors and generally did not verify the propriety of the
amounts billed. However, in those cases, upon our inquiry, UMMS could not
provide documentation to support that the supervisor had verified the
invoices. In addition, UMMS could not identify the designated employees
responsible for monitoring several of the contracts we tested.
Board Member Involvement in Procurement of Associated Business Activity
Due to certain limitations imposed by UMMS on our access to its records, we
could not definitively determine the extent to which any of the Board
23

--- Page 26 ---
members were involved in UMMS’ procurement of their associated business
entities. These limitations are discussed in greater detail in the Scope,
Objectives, and Methodology section. In addition, the focus of our review
was to determine, from UMMS’ perspective, the propriety of its financial
relationships with its Board members; consequently we did not obtain
explanations for any of these transactions from the Board members or the
associated businesses.
Board Approval and Awareness of the Contracts
UMMS policy did not specifically require the Board of Directors to approve
the procurements and related payments to the Board members and their
associated businesses. Due to limitations on access to certain UMMS records
(described more fully in the Scope, Objectives, and Methodology section of
this report), we could not readily determine the extent to which the Board was
aware of and/or approved this activity. However, our review of the Board
minutes and other documentation provided by UMMS disclosed that 9 of the
56 relationships with Board members and their associated businesses were
reported in annual presentations by UMMS to the Board of Directors but were
not formally approved by the full Board of Directors. Two of the contracts
were approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of
Directors.
A detailed description of our test results are presented by the respective Board
Member below.
Financial Interest by Board Member
As noted in Table 5, we identified 27 Board members associated with 56 business
entities that had received approximately $114.9 million from UMMS during the
period covered by our review. Of these, 18 Board members had a direct financial
relationship with one or more of 37 business entities that cumulatively received
approximately $108.2 million from UMMS which are presented by the respective
Board Member below. To ensure the confidentiality of the Board members and
the related associated businesses, we refer to each of these business entities using
the Board member numbers assigned in Table 5 and a letter for each business
entity (referred to as “Vendors”). For example, the two business entities
associated with Board Member 18 are referred to as Vendors 18A and 18B.
We identified that certain of the Board members also had a non-financial interest
with associated business entities that received payments from UMMS. This
activity, along with the activity associated with the remaining nine of these Board
24

members (6, 16, 19, and 22 through 27), is described further in the Other
Associated Business Entities section.

Test Results
UMMS did not competitively procure the contract. Based on our testing,
UMMS appeared to have been effectively monitoring the contract and
invoice payments tested were generally supported and accurate.
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 1 indicated they were
the owner of Vendor 1A. According to UMMS management, Vendor 1A has
been providing certain benefit administration services to UMMS affiliated
hospitals dating back to at least 2002, including comprehensive benefit
administration services provided to one UMMS hospital since 2008.
In January 2012, two former UMMS senior management employees
recommended that UMMS expand the comprehensive benefit administration
services provided by Vendor 1A to additional UMMS hospitals. UMMS
ultimately awarded Vendor 1A a contract which covered the period from January
2012 to June 2013, with the contract being approved by the Audit and
Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. The most recent contract with
Vendor 1A was awarded in July 2016 and covers the period through June 2020.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the current contract with Vendor
1A was not competitively procured. UMMS management advised us that the
vendor was selected because it had been performing the services under a previous
competitively procured contract. In this regard, we noted that the 2012 contract
also had not been competitively procured. Rather, documentation related to
management’s recommendation cited that Vendor 1A had been performing these
services under a 2008 contract with one UMMS hospital and that a consulting
study recommended using Vendor 1A to provide benefits administration services
as the basis for the award. However, UMMS was unable to provide sufficient
documentation to support the 2008 competitive procurement and our review of
25

--- Page 28 ---
the consultant study did not identify any recommendation to specifically use
Vendor 1A for these services.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS’ review of vendor invoices for the benefits
administration services provided appeared to be sufficient. Specifically, the
contract provided that Vendor 1A would invoice UMMS monthly for insurance
premiums (which would then be paid to the respective insurers) and an
administrative fee for each employee in the plan. UMMS could not readily
provide a breakdown between the cost of insurance premiums and the
administrative fees paid to Vendor 1A during the period we reviewed. However,
our test of four invoices totaling approximately $1.8 million paid to Vendor 1A
during the period from November 2016 to February 2019 disclosed that the
premium and administrative fees paid were consistent with the contract.
A fifth invoice tested included an incentive payment to Vendor 1A of $435,767
for increasing UMMS employee utilization of UMMS hospitals for their medical
care. Although this incentive payment was provided for in the 2012 contract (but
not paid until November 2016), UMMS could not provide support of its
calculation of the payment amount; therefore, we could not verify that the
payment was proper.

Test Results
UMMS competitively procured the contract we selected for review.
UMMS did not adequately monitor certain aspects of the contract, and we
could not determine the propriety of certain related payments selected for
review.
Background
According to the response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 2 was a
senior management employee and shareholder of Vendor 2A, which provides
UMMS with various banking services. Based on documentation we reviewed, it
appeared that Vendor 2A had a longstanding relationship with UMMS for at least
25 years. Our data matches only identified payments to Vendor 2A totaling
$15,996 as indicated in UMMS’ disbursement records. However, Board Member
2’s response to our June 2019 questionnaire indicated that the relationship with
26

--- Page 29 ---
UMMS generated interest income and fees to Vendor 2A between $3.1 million
and $4.7 million annually for the period we reviewed.
Subsequent inquiries with UMMS staff disclosed that many of the payments made
to Vendor 2A were made through debits to UMMS bank accounts; however,
UMMS could not readily provide a comprehensive accounting of these payments.
Although we could not corroborate the payments to Vendor 2A reported by Board
Member 2, relying on the Board Member’s assertions and UMMS bank
statements (see below), we believe the amounts reported by the Board Member
are a more reliable reflection of the income and fees earned by Vendor 2A from
its relationship with UMMS. Specifically, Board Member 2 reported interest
income and fees totaling $15,831,000 for fiscal years 2016 through 2019. As a
result, we included this amount, along with the $15,996 indicated in UMMS’
disbursement records, in the disbursements reflected in Table 5.
Procurement
UMMS had multiple relationships (such as loans, letters of credit, and depository
accounts) with Vendor 2A during the period covered by our review. We selected
UMMS’ procurement of Vendor 2A as the administrative agent for its $250
million revolving line of credit (RLOC) for our review. In August 2016, UMMS
selected Vendor 2A as the administrative agent for the RLOC through a
competitive procurement process. We noted that the decision to procure the
contract involved UMMS management and the Financial Affairs and System
Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors. The RLOC was intended to
address UMMS’ need to lower the effective interest rate on its debt portfolio and
simplify the administration of its borrowing practices.
Payments
The contract provided for UMMS to pay Vendor 2A an annual administrative fee,
as well as interest and other fees incurred through the use of the RLOC. We
obtained UMMS bank statements for the period from calendar years 2016 through
2018 and confirmed that Vendor 2A debited UMMS’ account for the proper
administrative fees. However, UMMS did not monitor and therefore could not
readily determine the amount of interest and other fees it had paid to Vendor 2A
related to the RLOC. Therefore, other than for the administrative fees, we could
not determine whether the amounts paid were consistent with the contract.

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 3 indicated that they
had a consulting agreement with UMMS. Our data match disclosed that UMMS
made payments totaling $248,838 to Board Member 3 during the period of our
review. According to UMMS management, Board Member 3 has provided
consulting services related to UMMS performance improvement initiatives under
a contract awarded in January 2018. The most recent contract was awarded to the
Board Member in January 2019 and covered the period through December 2019.
UMMS subsequently terminated the agreement in April 2019. Based on our
review of available documentation, which consisted solely of the two contracts
with Board Member 3, the agreements appeared to have been initiated and
approved by a former UMMS senior management employee.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, neither contract with Board
Member 3 was competitively procured. Specifically, the most recent contract
with the Board Member was an extension of the 2018 contract, which was not
competitively procured.
Payments
UMMS did not effectively monitor the contract with Board Member 3. The
contract provided for UMMS to pay a $15,000 monthly fee to the Board Member
for work related to UMMS performance improvement initiatives. However, the
contract did not contain specific deliverables to be provided by the Board Member
and UMMS could not explain how the monthly fee was calculated.
UMMS management advised that the work performed by the Board Member
primarily consisted of identifying vendors to perform various services for UMMS,
including three vendors (see Vendor 3B, Vendor 3C, and Vendor 3D below) with
which the Board Member had a financial interest. Our test of 16 payments
28

--- Page 31 ---
totaling $240,000 made to the Board Member between January 2018 and April
2019 disclosed that UMMS could not provide any work product provided by the
Board Member under the consulting contracts to support the amounts billed.
Therefore, we were unable to verify the propriety of these payments.

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 3 indicated that they
received commissions totaling $92,970 from Vendor 3B9. In June 2010, UMMS
awarded a three-year contract to Vendor 3B to identify cost savings opportunities
related to certain routine business expenses (for example, office supplies and
telecommunications). The contract provided for Vendor 3B to negotiate on behalf
of UMMS to obtain more advantageous pricing from vendors in exchange for a
percentage of any savings realized by UMMS. The most recent contract with the
vendor was awarded in March 2013 and covers the period through June 2021.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the most recent contract with
Vendor 3B was not competitively procured. UMMS management advised that it
did not competitively procure the contract because it was satisfied with the
services provided by Vendor 3B under the 2010 contract. In this regard, the 2010
contract also had not been competitively procured. Rather, UMMS management
advised that Vendor 3B was identified by Board Member 3 to assist UMMS with
cost reduction efforts.
UMMS management further advised us that it did not believe the services needed
to be competitively procured because the contract costs consisted of realized
savings. However, UMMS had not performed an analysis to determine whether
the cost savings percentage the vendor received was reasonable or if the services
could be obtained from another vendor for a lower rate.
9 Since our questionnaire only requested Board members to disclose payments received during our
review period, Board Member 3 may have received additional commission payments from
Vendor 3B prior to January 2016.
29

--- Page 32 ---
Payments
Our test of five payments totaling $504,000 made to Vendor 3B disclosed that
UMMS did not adequately verify the propriety of the vendor’s invoices. The
contract provided that the vendor was to be a paid a percentage of the cost savings
realized by UMMS. UMMS could not document that it verified the cost savings
reported by Vendor 3B to UMMS accounting records for any of the payments
tested.
While we were able to verify that the amounts invoiced to UMMS were consistent
with documentation provided by Vendor 3B, we were unable to verify the validity
of the vendor’s data. Specifically, UMMS could not readily provide us with the
records reportedly used by Vendor 3B to determine the amount saved, and
consequently, we could not verify that the amounts invoiced were proper for any
of the items tested.

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 3 indicated that they
received commissions totaling $3,000 from Vendor 3C during the period we
reviewed. In July 2018, the UMMS Internal Audit Department awarded a
contract to Vendor 3C to provide audit services related to the construction of one
medical center. The contract term was to be concurrent with the construction
project.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, UMMS did not competitively
procure the contract with Vendor 3C. UMMS management advised that Vendor
3C had been identified by Board Member 3 and that it had inquired with another
vendor (that provided UMMS certain internal audit services) about providing the
services, but determined that Vendor 3C offered the most advantageous price.
However, UMMS could not provide us with documentation to support the inquiry
or the related claimed advantageous pricing.

Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS effectively monitored the contract with Vendor 3C.
Specifically, Vendor 3C was to invoice UMMS for the hours worked on the audit

established contract rates and that UMMS received the required deliverables.

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 3 indicated that they
received commissions totaling $208,405 from Vendor 3D during the period of our
review. In June 2015, UMMS awarded Vendor 3D a contract to provide staff
scheduling software and related support services to one medical center for the
period from July 2015 through July 2018. UMMS awarded Vendor 3D another
contract in January 2016 to provide these services to one institute through
December 2020. UMMS management advised us that it did not renew the
medical center contract after it expired, but the institute’s contract was still active
as of October 2019.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure either of the two contracts awarded to
Vendor 3D. We were advised by a former UMMS senior management employee
that Vendor 3D was selected for the first contract based on a suggestion from
Board Member 3. According to the former UMMS senior management
employee, the medical center contract was intended to serve as a pilot program so
that UMMS could determine whether to use Vendor 3D’s services at other
UMMS hospitals. Based on our review of available documentation, the basis for
selecting Vendor 3D for the second contract was the work performed by the
vendor under the medical center contract.
We were advised that UMMS subsequently procured another vendor to provide
these services through a competitive procurement.
31

Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not monitor the contract effectively. UMMS
was invoiced monthly for its use of the staff scheduling software and related
analytical reports that Vendor 3D provided at a fixed rate specified in the contract.
Our test of five payments totaling $282,135 made to Vendor 3D between March
2016 and February 2019 disclosed that UMMS could not provide the analytical
reports from the vendor associated with four payments totaling $260,000.

UMMS did not competitively procure the contract. Based on our testing,
UMMS appeared to have been effectively monitoring the contract, and
invoice payments tested were supported and accurate.
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 3 indicated that an
immediate family member (adult child) received commissions totaling
approximately $537,000 from Vendor 3E during the period of our review for
enrolling UMMS employees in the vendor’s voluntary supplemental insurance
coverage. According to documentation provided by UMMS, its relationship with
Vendor 3E dated back to at least 2011.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the contract with Vendor 3E. The only
documentation provided to support the contract with the vendor were various
billing agreements which indicated that the vendor would bill UMMS for the
related insurance premiums. Although UMMS’ involvement was limited to
paying the vendor using funds withheld from participating employees’ paychecks,
and the coverage was voluntary, in our opinion, UMMS had a fiduciary duty to its
employees to ensure that the best value for the service was obtained.
10 This amount includes $235,529 processed by the Upper Chesapeake Health System, $309,643
processed by the Charles Regional Medical Center, and $74,855 processed by the Capital
Region Medical Center. As noted in the Scope and Methodology for Objective 3,
disbursements processed by these affiliates were not included in the population from which we
selected our test items.

Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS’ review of the invoices for employee supplemental
insurance coverage appeared to be sufficient. The billing agreements provided
that the vendor would invoice UMMS monthly for insurance premiums, and
UMMS paid the invoices with funds withheld from the participating employees’
paychecks. Our test of five payments totaling $433,750 made to Vendor 3E
between January 2017 and January 2019 disclosed that the amounts UMMS paid
the vendor were accurate and supported.

of the related payments selected for review.
Background
According to State records, Board Member 4 received financial compensation
from the parent company of Vendor 4A during the period of our review. Our data
matches disclosed that UMMS paid Vendor 4A approximately $1.7 million
during the period of our review. According to UMMS, Vendor 4A provides
temporary contractual employees to UMMS on an as-needed basis under a
contract awarded to the vendor in May 2011. The contract was still active as of
October 2019.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the May 2011 contract with
Vendor 4A was not competitively procured, and UMMS could not provide
documentation that any consideration was given to initiating a new procurement
for the services.
Payments
UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by Vendor 4A. The
contract provided for UMMS to issue purchase orders to request temporary
contractual employees and Vendor 4A was to invoice UMMS monthly for the
employees’ services. Our test of five payments made to Vendor 4A totaling
$39,946 between January 2016 and April 2019 disclosed that UMMS could not
33

provide the vendor’s fee schedule to support that the hourly rates it paid were
proper nor explain the specific services that were provided by the temporary
employees for any of the invoices tested. Therefore, we could not verify the

Background
According to State records, Board Member 4 received financial compensation
from the parent company of Vendor 4B during the period of our review. Our data
matches disclosed that UMMS made payments totaling $73,903 to the vendor
during the period of our review. UMMS advised that it awarded the vendor a
contract in February 2019 to recruit for specialized legal counsel positions.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, UMMS did not competitively
procure the contract with Vendor 4B. UMMS advised us that Vendor 4B was
selected because it specialized in recruiting candidates to provide legal services.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS appeared to effectively monitor the services
provided by the vendor. Specifically, the contract provided that UMMS was to
pay the vendor in three installments based on the estimated salary to be paid for
the positions. As of November 2019, UMMS had filled one of the positions and
the installment payments tested were consistent with the terms of the contract.
11 The total amount paid to Vendor 4B included 12 disbursements totaling $40,303 processed by
the Upper Chesapeake Health System. As noted in the Scope and Methodology for Objective 3,
disbursements processed by this affiliate were not included in the population from which we
selected our test items (we tested the one disbursement that was not processed by UCHS).

UMMS did not competitively procure the contract, and the contract was

adequately monitor the contract, and we could not determine the propriety
of the related payments selected for review.
Background
Our data matches and subsequent review of available UMMS financial records
disclosed that UMMS made payments totaling approximately $5.1 million during
the period of our review to Vendor 4C, which had a direct financial connection to
a vendor from which Board Member 4 received financial compensation. UMMS
management advised us that it has used Vendor 4C since January 2015 to develop
and implement a transitional care program at one medical center and to provide
staff to one institute. The most recent contract with Vendor 4C was awarded in
September 2017 and covered the period through June 2019.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the current contract with Vendor
4C was not competitively procured. Furthermore, the services being provided to
the institute were not included in the scope of this contract that covered the
medical center. UMMS management advised us that it has not awarded a contract
to Vendor 4C for those services at the institute.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by
Vendor 4C to the medical center and the institute. Specifically, the current
contract required UMMS to make monthly payments to Vendor 4C in exchange
for services rendered. However, our test of three payments totaling $122,451
made between September 2018 and March 2019 disclosed that, although the
payments were consistent with the contract, UMMS did not obtain evidence to
support that the services were provided.
12 This amount includes $109,024 processed by the Capital Region Medical Center, $119,575
processed by the Charles Regional Medical Center, and $99,632 processed by the Upper
Chesapeake Health System. As noted in the Scope and Methodology for Objective 3,
disbursements processed by these affiliates were not included in the population from which we

35

--- Page 38 ---
UMMS did not identify an employee responsible for monitoring Vendor 4C’s
services at the institute and could not explain how the amounts paid to Vendor 4C
for these services were determined since there was no associated contract. Our
test of five payments totaling $23,933 made between July and December 2016
disclosed that the invoices did not include a description of the services provided.
Consequently, we were unable to verify the propriety of the amounts billed or
confirm whether the services were provided.

Background
According to State records, Board Member 4 received financial compensation
from the parent company of Vendor 4D during the period of our review. Our data
matches disclosed that UMMS made payments totaling approximately $5.2
million to Vendor 4D during the period of our review. UMMS management
advised us that it has used Vendor 4D to obtain temporary contractual information
technology (IT) employees since 2015. The most recent contract with Vendor 4D
was awarded in March 2016 and covers the period through March 2021.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the most recent contract with
Vendor 4D was not competitively procured. Specifically, we were advised by
UMMS management that Vendor 4D was selected because it was satisfied with
the services and pricing received from the vendor under the previous contract,
which it stated was competitively awarded in January 2015. Although we were
able to confirm that the 2015 contract was competitively procured, our review
disclosed that the scope of the two contracts was not the same and therefore, there
was no basis for determining whether the terms of the current contract were in the
best interest of UMMS.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the contract with Vendor
4D. The contract provided for UMMS to issue work orders that specified the
36

--- Page 39 ---
work to be performed and the hourly rate UMMS would pay. However, UMMS
could not provide the work orders to support any of the four payments tested
totaling $293,497 made between June 2016 and July 2018. Therefore, we could
not determine the propriety of the amounts invoiced or confirm whether the
related services were provided.

Test Results
UMMS did not competitively procure the contract. Based on our testing,
UMMS appeared to have been effectively monitoring the contract, and
invoice payments tested were supported and accurate.
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 5 indicated that they
were the owner of Vendor 5A. Our data matches disclosed two payments made in
September 2016 to the vendor. According to documentation provided by UMMS
management, Vendor 5A represented a third-party seller and served as the escrow
agent for a real estate transaction between UMMS and the seller. Specifically, in
a June 2016 meeting one regional medical center’s Board of Directors approved
the acquisition of approximately 31 acres of land for future development. Board
Member 5 was also a board member of the regional medical center’s Board of
Directors.
Procurement
UMMS did not select Vendor 5A as the escrow agent for the transaction through a
competitive procurement. According to UMMS management, it chose to use
Vendor 5A rather than competitively procuring the services because Vendor 5A
already represented the seller in the transaction. We noted that Vendor 5A’s
representation of the seller was disclosed during the aforementioned June 2016
regional medical center’s Board meeting and the related meeting minutes UMMS
provided us indicated that Board Member 5 did not participate in discussions or
vote on this matter.
Payments
Based on our testing, both payments made to Vendor 5A were in accordance with
the contract between UMMS and the seller. Specifically, the contract required
37

--- Page 40 ---
UMMS to make an initial deposit of $100,000 and pay the balance (including the
$4 million payment) at closing. The UMMS Treasury Department processed both
payments via electronic wire transfers to Vendor 5A as specified by the contract.
According to the related United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development Settlement Statement that we were provided for the transaction,
Vendor 5A received title fees totaling $2,000, which included $1,300 paid from
UMMS funds. We were unable to determine the extent of other compensations
(such as commissions on the title insurance) Vendor 5A may have received
related to this transaction.

Due to a lack of available documentation, we were unable to determine

testing, UMMS appeared to have been effectively monitoring the contract
and invoice payments tested were generally supported and accurate.
Background
According to State records, Board Member 7’s spouse received financial
compensation from Vendor 7A during the period of our review. Our data matches
disclosed payments to Vendor 7A totaling approximately $3.9 million from
UMMS during the period of our review. UMMS management advised us that
13 Vendor 5B was also an associated business of Board Member 9.
38

--- Page 41 ---
Vendor 7A is the third-party billing administrator for another vendor that
provided voluntary supplemental insurance coverage to employees at two UMMS
hospitals. Based on the documentation provided, the insurance vendor has been
providing coverage at those hospitals since 2011 and 2015, respectively.
Procurement
We were unable to determine how Vendor 7A was selected as the third-party
billing administrator for the insurance vendor. Specifically, UMMS management
provided us with the UMMS hospitals’ billing agreements with the insurance
vendor, which indicated that Vendor 7A would bill UMMS for the related
insurance premiums. However, UMMS could not identify any employees who
had knowledge of how Vendor 7A’s relationship with the insurance vendor
began. Therefore, we could not determine whether UMMS was involved in the
selection of Vendor 7A as the third-party billing administrator for the agreements.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS’ review of the invoices for employee supplemental
insurance coverage appeared to be sufficient. Specifically, the billing agreement
with the insurance vendor provided that Vendor 7A would invoice UMMS
monthly for insurance premiums. UMMS paid the invoices with funds withheld
from the participating employees’ paychecks. Our test of seven invoices totaling
approximately $271,000 paid during the period from January 2016 through
January 2019 disclosed that the amounts UMMS paid were generally accurate and
supported.

14 This amount included $145,737 processed by the Charles Regional Medical Center ($74,323)
and the Upper Chesapeake Health System ($71,414) to the vendor that provided waste

processed by these affiliates were not included in the population from which we selected our
test items.
39

--- Page 42 ---
Background
According to disclosure statements filed by Board Member 8, their spouse was a
registered lobbyist for several entities. Our data matches disclosed UMMS
payments totaling $2.7 million to six entities represented by Board Member 8’s
spouse, including three vendors that were paid approximately $2.6 million, an
entity that received charitable donations totaling $23,000, and two entities to
which UMMS paid membership fees totaling $69,203.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure two of the three aforementioned vendors.
Specifically, UMMS awarded a contract to one vendor (for pharmaceuticals) and
had not documented its justification for not competitively purchasing the
products. UMMS could not provide a contract with the other vendor (for waste
management services) for the period covered by our review nor identify any
employees who were involved in the procurement. The third vendor (for post-
discharge care services) was competitively procured.
In regard to the charitable donations totaling $23,000 made to the entity receiving
lobbyist services, we were advised that UMMS periodically made donations at
management’s discretion (exclusive of the Boards input) to entities that were
aligned with UMMS’ mission or provided a community benefit or a service
related to a community health need. However, UMMS did not document its
justification for the selection of this specific entity (a nationally recognized non-
profit involved in childhood disease medical research) and the amount of the
charitable donations. The remaining two entities were paid membership fees for
services (for example membership in a senior care provider advocacy group) that
did not warrant a competitive procurement process.
Payments
UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by the two vendors that
were not competitively procured. Specifically, during the period of our review
UMMS paid one vendor $433,593 for pharmaceuticals without sufficient
monitoring of the amounts paid. Our test of six invoices totaling $24,158 paid
between March 2018 and January 2019 disclosed that the amounts billed on two
invoices (totaling $5,808) were not in accordance with the specified contract
rates. As noted above, UMMS could not provide us with a contract for the other
vendor, which it paid approximately $1.2 million for waste management services.
Consequently, we were unable to determine the vendor’s rates and therefore could
not verify the propriety of any of the six payments tested totaling $40,760. Since
UMMS could not identify an employee responsible for monitoring these
contracts, both of which were active during our review, we were unable to verify
that UMMS received the required deliverables.
40

--- Page 43 ---
In regard to the aforementioned donation, UMMS could not provide evidence that
it received the tickets to a fundraising event that were to be provided in return for
the donation or indicate who attended. However, UMMS advised that the
purpose of the payment was to donate to the charitable organization and not to
purchase event tickets. UMMS also could not provide support for the
membership rate it paid to one entity that received $7,804 from UMMS during the
period of our review. Based on our testing, payments to the other entity from
which UMMS purchased membership fees were made at the proper rate.

the contract was procured prior to UCHS becoming a UMMS affiliate, we did not review the
original procurement.
41

--- Page 44 ---
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 10 indicated that they
were an owner of Vendor 10A. Our data matches disclosed that UMMS made
payments totaling approximately $2.4 million to Vendor 10A during the period of
our review. According to UMMS, Vendor 10A has provided certain medical
services to two UMMS medical centers since 2009 and 2012, respectively.
The most recent contract between one medical center and Vendor 10A was a one-
year contract awarded in July 2009, before that center became a UMMS affiliate.
The most recent contract between the second medical center and Vendor 10A was
a one-year contract awarded to the vendor in January 2015. Both contracts
contained an automatic annual renewal clause.
Procurement
We reviewed the procurement of the contract for services at the second medical
center. Based on our review of available documentation, the most recent contract
awarded to Vendor 10A was not competitively procured. Specifically, the only
documentation UMMS could provide for the procurement was the executed
contract. UMMS could not identify any employees with direct knowledge of how
the vendor was procured to provide services to this medical center.
Payments
Although our testing disclosed that payments to Vendor 10A were consistent with
the rate specified in the contract, we were unable to determine whether UMMS
verified that needed services were provided. Specifically, Vendor 10A invoiced
UMMS monthly at a fixed daily rate specified in the contract to provide an on-call
surgeon to the second medical center. In this regard, our test of five payments to
the vendor totaling $90,500 made between October 2016 and September 2018
disclosed that all five payments were consistent with the established contract rate.
However, UMMS could not identify any employees who were responsible for
monitoring the services provided by Vendor 10A or any documentation that all
needed services had been provided (that is, surgeons provided services when
requested by the medical center).

UMMS did not competitively procure the contract nor could it provide a

the contract, and we could not determine the propriety of the related
payments selected for review.
Background
According to the response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 11 was
the owner of Vendor 11A. We were advised by UMMS management that UMMS
has used Vendor 11A to provide ambulatory transportation services (primarily in
one geographic area of the state) since at least 2001. Specifically, UMMS entered
into a contract with Vendor 11A that was executed in June 2001. The contract
was extended several times and ultimately ended in July 2017, but UMMS
continued to pay the vendor after the contract expired. Subsequently, a contract
was awarded to Vendor 11A in December 2017 which covered the period through
July 2019.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the most recent contract with
Vendor 11A was not competitively procured and UMMS did not document its
justification for not competitively procuring the services as required by its
procurement policy. UMMS management advised that the services were not
competitively procured because Vendor 11A was the only ambulatory
transportation company within a certain geographic area. However, no
documentation was provided to support this assertion that this was a sole source
procurement.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not monitor the contract effectively. The
contract provided that Vendor 11A would invoice UMMS for the costs incurred
from transporting uninsured patients to and from UMMS facilities. These costs
included a per-mile fee and certain operating expenses (for example, vehicle
maintenance). Our test of 10 invoices totaling $330,924 paid to Vendor 11A
during the period from August 2016 through September 2018 disclosed that the
43

--- Page 46 ---
invoices reflected only a lump sum amount for each patient the vendor
transported, with no details to support how the amounts were calculated.
Additionally, UMMS could not provide support that Vendor 11A had attempted
to bill patients or their insurance companies prior to invoicing UMMS for the
services as required by their contract. Due to the aforementioned conditions, we
could not verify that any of the invoices tested were proper.

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 12 indicated that they
were the majority owner of Vendor 12A. We were advised by UMMS
management that it awarded a contract to Vendor 12A in June 2018 to use the
vendor’s computer software at certain UMMS hospitals and participating nursing
homes. The contract covered the period between June 2018 and June 2019.
Vendor 12A terminated the contract in April 2019. Based on available
documentation, the contract with Vendor 12A appeared to have been awarded by
a former UMMS senior management employee.
Procurement
UMMS did not award the contract to Vendor 12A through a competitive
procurement. We were advised by a former UMMS senior management
employee that the contract was a pilot program for the use of the software at no
cost to UMMS and that UMMS had intended to competitively procure the
services once the pilot contract ended. Our review disclosed that while the initial
term of the contract did not have any cost to UMMS, there were provisions for
costs after the initial term. Specifically, after the initial term the contract required
UMMS to pay Vendor 12A a monthly fee for each affiliate that used the software.
The contract was to automatically renew each year. Therefore, it did not appear
that UMMS intended to competitively procure the services.
Payments
UMMS did not make any payments to Vendor 12A during the period we
reviewed; thus, our review did not include a test of payments.

disclose disbursements to Vendor 12B during the period of our review, UMMS
advised that a former senior management employee entered into a ground lease
option agreement with Vendor 12B in February 2019.
The agreement granted Vendor 12B the right to enter into a future ground lease
with UMMS to construct a comprehensive nursing and rehabilitation facility at an
existing UMMS medical center. According to documentation provided by
UMMS, Vendor 12B would also operate the facility upon completion. UMMS
management advised us that it did not execute the ground lease and the related
option contract was terminated effective April 1, 2019.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively award the ground lease option contract.
Specifically, UMMS could not provide any documentation that other vendors
were solicited to construct and operate the nursing and rehabilitation facility.
Payments
The ground lease option contract provided for Vendor 12B to pay UMMS $1,000;
however, UMMS management advised us that Vendor 12B did not make this
payment and no payments were identified by our data match.

payments selected for review.
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 12 indicated that they
held an ownership interest in Vendor 12C. Our data matches disclosed that
UMMS made payments totaling $16,125 to Vendor 12C during the period of our
review. According to UMMS management, it periodically purchased advertising
in Vendor 12C’s regional publication. We were advised that these purchases
were made on an as-needed basis.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the services from Vendor 12C. We
reviewed three purchases totaling $6,300 made from the vendor between March
2017 and March 2018. UMMS did not have a formal contract with the vendor for
any of the payments reviewed. We were advised by UMMS management that all
three purchases were made as sole source, but UMMS had not documented its
justification for not competitively procuring the services as required by its
procurement policy. UMMS management advised us that Vendor 12C’s audience
was a demographic that it wanted to reach, but could not provide any
documentation to support this assertion.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by
Vendor 12C to ensure the payments were proper. Specifically, the only
documentation provided for the three purchases reviewed were the vendor’s
invoices. Since UMMS could not provide us with a contract that included Vendor

UMMS did not competitively procure these services nor could it provide a

required by its procurement policy. UMMS did not adequately monitor
the services, and we could not determine the propriety of the related
payments selected for review.
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 12 indicated that they
held an ownership interest in Vendor 12D. Our data matches disclosed that
UMMS made payments totaling $23,600 to Vendor 12D during the period of our
review. According to UMMS management, it periodically purchased various
advertising services from Vendor 12D on an as-needed basis.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the services from Vendor 12D. We
reviewed five purchases totaling $14,100 made from Vendor 12D between July
2016 and April 2019. UMMS did not have a formal contract with Vendor 12D
for any of the payments reviewed. We were advised by UMMS management that
all of these purchases were made as sole source, but UMMS had not documented
its justification for not competitively procuring the services as required by its
procurement policy. UMMS management advised us that Vendor 12D’s audience
was a demographic that it wanted to reach but could not provide any
documentation to support this assertion.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by
Vendor 12D to ensure they were proper. Specifically, the only documentation
provided for the five purchases reviewed were the related vendor invoices. Since
UMMS could not provide us with a contract that included Vendor 12D’s rates, we
could not verify the propriety of the payment. In addition, UMMS could not
provide evidence to support that the services were provided (for example, a copy
of an advertisement from the print publication).

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 12 indicated that they
were the majority owner of Vendor 12E. Our data matches disclosed that UMMS
made payments to Vendor 12E totaling $91,617 during the period covered by our
review. UMMS was unable to provide an explanation of the services provided by
Vendor 12E which, according to the invoice tested, were consulting fees.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the services from Vendor 12E and could
not provide us with any contract with Vendor 12E. We reviewed one purchase
totaling $5,000 made from Vendor 12E in January 2016. UMMS was unable to
provide any documentation to explain how Vendor 12E was selected and what
services the vendor provided.
Payment
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by
Vendor 12E to ensure they were proper. The invoice reviewed indicated that
Vendor 12E billed UMMS $5,000 for a monthly consulting fee. Since UMMS
could not provide us with a contract that included Vendor 12E’s rate, we could
not verify the propriety of the payment. In addition, UMMS could not explain or
document the receipt of any consulting services received from Vendor 12E.

the propriety of the payments tested.
Background
According to State records, Board Member 12’s adult child received financial
compensation from Vendor 12F during the period we reviewed. Our data
matches disclosed that UMMS made payments totaling $696,172 to Vendor 12F
during the period covered by our review. UMMS management advised us that the
UMMS Office of General Counsel engaged the vendor to provide legal services
on an as-needed basis.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the services from Vendor 12F. We
reviewed five purchases totaling $115,833 made from Vendor 12F between May
2016 and March 2019. UMMS management advised us that Vendor 12F was
selected due to its legal expertise in certain areas of the law. However, UMMS
did not formally document its justification for not competitively procuring the
services.
Payments
Based on our testing, we were unable to assess UMMS’ monitoring of the
services provided by Vendor 12F to ensure they were proper. Specifically, our
test of the aforementioned five payments disclosed that UMMS did not perform a
documented review of the invoices to ensure the services were received prior to
approving the invoices for payment. However, of more significance, UMMS,
citing attorney-client privilege, redacted Vendor 12F’s description of the services
rendered on four of the invoices we reviewed and declined to provide any work
product provided by the vendor to support the amounts billed. Consequently, we
were unable to verify the propriety of any of the payments tested.

Test Results
UMMS did not competitively procure the contract. UMMS did not

documentation so that we could determine the propriety of the related
payments selected for review.
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 13 indicated they
were the owner of Vendor 13A. According to UMMS management, Vendor 13A
has provided pest control services at UMMS affiliated hospitals since 2011.
Specifically, in August 2011, the UMMS Supply Chain Management Department
awarded Vendor 13A a contract for pest control services that covered the period
through July 2015. Following the expiration of that contract, UMMS awarded
another contract to Vendor 13A which covered the period from August 2015
through July 2019.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the most recent contract with
Vendor 13A awarded in August 2015 was not competitively procured. UMMS
management advised us that it did not competitively procure the most recent
contract because it was satisfied with the services provided by Vendor 13A under
the 2011 contract, which had been approved by the Audit and Compliance
Committee of the Board of Directors. Although UMMS was able to provide
documentation to corroborate that the 2011 contract was competitively procured,
it could not provide a documented justification for not competitively procuring
the most recent contract.
Payments
UMMS did not effectively monitor the contract with Vendor 13A. Vendor 13A
generally billed UMMS for the services provided at fixed rates for each type of
service as established in the contract. The contract required Vendor 13A to
complete a service log maintained at each UMMS hospital to document the date,
location, and specific service provided, which could be used to support the
amounts invoiced.
50

--- Page 53 ---
However, UMMS could not provide the service logs to support 9 of the 10
invoices tested (related to services provided at 6 UMMS affiliated hospitals)
totaling $22,203 paid between June 2016 and March 2019, and the invoices did
not contain sufficient detail to explain how the amounts billed were calculated.
For example, the contract provided for the vendor to apply liquid termite
treatment at a fixed cost per square foot. Our test of one invoice for this service
(totaling $3,024) disclosed that the invoice did not identify the size of the area
Vendor 13A treated, and UMMS could not provide the related service log entry to
document that the services were provided. As a result, we were unable to verify
that the services billed by Vendor 13A were provided and in accordance with the
contract rates.

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 14 indicated that they
had a consulting agreement with UMMS. Our data match identified that UMMS
made payments totaling $496,629 directly to Board Member 14 during the period
of our review (consisting primarily of a certain monthly fee, see below).
According to UMMS management, Board Member 14 has provided consulting
services primarily related to UMMS expansion efforts and hospital acquisitions
under a contract originally awarded in September 2012. The most recent contract
renewal occurred in September 2018 and covered the period through September
2019. UMMS subsequently terminated the contract in April 2019.
Procurement
Based on our review of available documentation, the most recent contract with
Board Member 14 was not competitively procured. Based on our review of
available documentation, the contract appeared to have been initiated and
approved by a former senior management employee.
51

Payments
UMMS did not effectively monitor the contract with Board Member 14. The
contract provided for UMMS to pay a $13,000 monthly fee to the Board Member
in exchange for various consulting services, including assisting with UMMS
expansion efforts. However, the contract did not contain specific deliverables to
be provided by the Board Member, and UMMS could not explain how the
monthly fee was calculated.
According to UMMS management, the work performed by the Board member
primarily consisted of assisting UMMS with a fundraising campaign for the
construction of a new medical center. However, our test of 24 payments totaling
$312,000 made to the Board Member between September 2016 and September
2018 disclosed that UMMS could not provide any work product provided by the
Board Member under the contracts to support the amounts billed; therefore, we
were unable to verify the propriety of any of the payments.

Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 15 indicated they
were the owner of Vendor 15A. According to UMMS management, Vendor 15A
has provided engineering services related to the construction of a UMMS medical
center since June 2013. Our data matches disclosed payments from UMMS to
Vendor 15A totaling $496,404 during the period of our review. The UMMS
Construction and Facilities Planning Department awarded the vendor a contract in
June 2013 to assist with the initial schematic design and Certificate of Need
application for the project. UMMS subsequently amended the 2013 contract 29

times to include additional engineering services, the most recent of which was
executed in August 2019.
Procurement
Although the original contract with Vendor 15A was competitively procured, our
review disclosed that UMMS processed 29 amendments for additional work
related to the project that was not included in the scope of the original contract
(for example, to develop detailed site and utility plans) rather than competitively
procuring the additional services. According to UMMS records, these
amendments increased the original value of the 2013 contract ($193,450) by
approximately $1.1 million. UMMS management advised us that Vendor 15A
was selected to provide the additional services because they had been
competitively procured under the 2013 contract and they were familiar with the
project. Although UMMS was able to provide documentation to corroborate that
the 2013 contract was competitively procured, it had not documented its
justification for not competitively procuring the additional services.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS effectively monitored the contract. Vendor 15A
generally billed UMMS for the percentage completed for the various tasks (such
as, design services) outlined in the contract and related amendments. Our test of
five invoices totaling $237,267 paid between February and September 2018
disclosed that the payments were consistent with the rates established in the
contract.

Background
Based on State records, Board Member 17’s adult child received financial
compensation from Vendor 17A during the period we reviewed. Our data
matches disclosed that UMMS made payments totaling $402,076 to Vendor 17A
during the period covered by our review. UMMS management advised us that
one medical center had a strategic partnership with Vendor 17A, which included
an agreement for the medical center to sponsor various community events hosted
by the vendor in exchange for advertising at those events.
Based on the documentation provided, the partnership dated back to at least
September 2016. The most recent contract provided by UMMS covers the period
from September 15, 2018 through September 14, 2020. The prior contract
provided by UMMS covered the period from September 15, 2016 through
September 14, 2018 and indicated it was an extension of a prior contract.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the most recent contract with Vendor 17A
(and offered no documentation that any prior contracts were competitively
procured). According to UMMS management, the contract was not competitively

management advised us that sponsorships were periodically awarded at
management’s discretion (exclusive of the Board’s input) to entities that UMMS
believed were aligned with its mission or provided a community benefit or a

determining the amount of the related payments, and UMMS could not provide
any documentation to explain its basis for sponsoring Vendor 17A.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the contract. The
contract required UMMS to pay a lump sum amount ($40,000) to Vendor 17A
each year21 in exchange for advertising at the various community events the
vendor hosted. Our test of two payments totaling $80,000 made to Vendor 17A in
September 2016 and June 2018 disclosed that UMMS could not provide any
examples of the community event advertisements it received as required by the
contract.

the items purchased and paid for were received.
Background
According to State records, Board Member 18 was the owner of Vendor 18A.
Our data matches disclosed that UMMS made two payments totaling $200,000 to
Vendor 18A during the period we reviewed. According to documentation,
UMMS provided, these payments were for the purchase of 40,000 copies of
Vendor 18A’s books. The purchased books were to be donated to a local school
system as part of a UMMS community outreach initiative. UMMS management
further advised us that a former UMMS senior management employee had
approved a total of five purchases from Vendor 18A, the earliest of which
occurred in 2010.
21 We could not readily determine why the total payments to the vendor during the period we
reviewed exceeded the amount UMMS was required to pay under the contracts. Specifically,
the payments related to the contracts provided only accounted for $120,000 of the $402,000 that
UMMS paid to the vendor between January 1, 2016 and April 18, 2019.
55

--- Page 58 ---
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively purchase the books from Vendor 18A. In this
regard, UMMS could not provide any documentation to explain why Vendor
18A’s books were selected and how the purchase amounts were determined. We
were advised that UMMS did not competitively procure the purchases because it
considered the purchases of the books to be sponsorships of the school system. In
this regard, UMMS did not have a formal policy for selecting entities for
sponsorships and for determining the amount of the related award.
UMMS could not explain how the book donation to the school system supported
its community outreach initiative nor explain why the payments were made to
Vendor 18A instead of directly to the school system. UMMS also had not
confirmed that the school system would accept the book donations prior to
making the purchases. UMMS had confirmed that the school system would
accept an earlier donation of the books purchased from Vendor 18A prior to the
period of our review.
Payments
UMMS did not effectively monitor the payments to Vendor 18A. UMMS made
two $100,000 payments to Vendor 18A. Each payment was to purchase 20,000
copies of Vendor 18A’s books. However, UMMS did not attempt to verify that
the books were delivered to the school system as intended. In a November 2019
plea agreement with federal law enforcement officials, Board Member 18
admitted that none of the 40,000 books UMMS purchased were provided to the
school system.

Background
Based on State records, Vendor 18B was the inaugural committee for Board
Member 18’s election to public office in 2016. Our data match identified that
UMMS made one payment totaling $20,000 to Vendor 18B during the period of
our review. UMMS management advised us that the payment was approved by a
former UMMS senior management employee to sponsor the Board Member’s
inauguration.
Procurement
Based on the documentation provided, UMMS did not document its justification
for making the payment to Vendor 18B. UMMS management considered the
payment to be a sponsorship, which it periodically made at management’s
discretion (exclusive of the Board’s input) to entities that were aligned with its

UMMS competitively procured the contract with the vendor. The amount
paid to the vendor was proper based on the policy.
Background
In response to our June 2019 questionnaire, Board Member 20 indicated that they
received a commission payment totaling approximately $20,000 from Vendor
20A. The payment related to a one-time purchase of an insurance policy brokered
by Vendor 20A. Our data matches disclosed that UMMS paid Vendor 20A
$213,460 for the policy. The policy was procured by UMMS in 2018 subsequent
to the acquisition of a cardiology group operating at a UMMS medical center.
We were advised that the policy was needed to provide the cardiology group with
coverage for claims made after the group was acquired that arose from liabilities
prior to the date of acquisition.
Procurement
Based on our review, UMMS appeared to have competitively procured the
insurance policy. Specifically, UMMS provided documentation to support that it
had obtained two quotes for the policy and selected Vendor 20A because it
offered the most advantageous price.
Payment
Based on our testing, the payment to Vendor 20A was consistent with the terms of
the insurance policy. We did not have access to the terms of Board Member 20’s
compensation agreement with Vendor 20A; therefore, we could not independently
verify the reported commissions paid to Board Member 20 by Vendor 20A.

have a formal contract with the vendor for the services.
Payment
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by
the vendor to ensure they were proper. In this regard, the only documentation we
were provided for this payment was the vendor invoice. Since UMMS did not
have a formal contract that included the vendor’s rate, we could not verify the
propriety of the payment. In addition UMMS could not provide evidence to
support that the services were provided (for example, a screen print of the

these disbursements were reflected in a dataset that was not subject to

Other Associated Business Entities
Background
Based on the responses to our June 2019 Board member questionnaire and our
review of available State records, we identified numerous business entities that
met our criteria for being considered an associated business, but for which we did
not identify a direct financial interest held by the Board members (or their
immediate family). Specifically, our review disclosed that 13 UMMS Board
members also served on the boards of 19 entities that received payments from
UMMS, although we were not able to identify any payments or compensation
made from the entities to the UMMS Board members. These entities consisted of
various non-profits, private entities, and certain associations in which UMMS was
a member. Based on our data matches, payments to these 19 entities during the
period from January 1, 2016 to April 18, 2019 totaled approximately $6.7 million
(see Table 6). According to UMMS management, these payments related to
sponsorships and donations, membership fees, and various services to be provided
by the entities to UMMS.
We included these disbursements due to the potential that a Board member could
have received a financial benefit. Since we did not have access to these entities’
records, any payments from these entities to UMMS Board members would not
be detected by our review. For example, certain news sources reported that one
non-profit entity had paid approximately $77,600 to Board Member 18’s
associated business (Vendor 18A). According to its records, UMMS paid this
non-profit entity $29,500 during the period of our review. Since we did not have
access to the records of Vendor 18A or the non-profit entity, we could not verify
the aforementioned payments and could not determine the extent to which the
Board Member 18 may have benefited from the payments that UMMS made to
this entity.

Our data matches disclosed payments totaling approximately $4.9 million to 12
entities that had no apparent financial relationships with 12 Board members, but
with which the members had some affiliation (such as serving on the entity’s
board). UMMS paid membership fees to three entities membership fees totaling
$4.3 million and paid nine entities sponsorships and charitable donations totaling
$612,821.
Procurement
UMMS paid membership fees to three entities for services (for example
membership in a Statewide healthcare association) without competitive
procurement. We determined that the selection of these entities without
competition was reasonable based on UMMS’ relationship to the entities. In
regard to the various sponsorships and donations, we were advised that UMMS
periodically made sponsorships and donations at UMMS management’s discretion
(exclusive of the Board’s input) to entities that were aligned with UMMS’
mission or provided a community benefit or a service related to a community
health need. However, UMMS did not document its justification for selecting the
nine entities (which included both locally and nationally recognized non-profits).
Payments
UMMS could not provide support for the membership fees paid to the three
entities totaling $4.3 million. For example, UMMS paid $4.1 million for
membership in a Statewide healthcare association. UMMS advised us that the
membership fees were determined using certain internal financial measures.
However, UMMS could not provide an explanation of these measures and our test
of five payments totaling $1.2 million made to the entity between July 2016 and
July 2018 disclosed that UMMS could not provide support to explain how the
dollar amount of each payment was determined. Consequently, we could not
determine the propriety of any of the five payments tested due to the lack of
available explanatory documentation.

In regard to the sponsorships and donations, UMMS could not provide evidence
that it received certain items (such as tickets to fundraising events) that were to be
received in exchange for certain sponsorships or donations. However, UMMS
advised us that the purpose of these payments was to contribute to the various
organizations and not to receive specific benefits.

UMMS did not adequately monitor the payments, and we could not

Background
Our data matches disclosed payments totaling $419,465 to four entities during the
period of our review that were determined to have non-financial relationships
with four Board members. Specifically, we identified a country club that was
paid $220,070 to host charity fundraisers, a private club that was paid $132,445 to
host various business events, and a medical alumni association and a regional
newspaper service from which UMMS had purchased advertising services
totaling $66,950.
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the services from the four entities and could
not always provide us with copies of the applicable contracts. UMMS advised us
that the country club and private club hosted fundraising and business events for
UMMS and were selected based on their locations. UMMS also advised us that
the audiences of the two entities that provided advertising services represented
demographics that it wanted to reach, but could not provide documentation to
support these assertions.
Payments
Based on our testing, UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided by
these entities. Our test of 10 payments to the four entities, totaling $238,693,
disclosed that the only documentation UMMS could provide to support each
payment was an invoice. Since UMMS could not always provide us with
contracts to support the rates charged for the services, nor provide evidence to
support that the services (for example, advertisements) were provided, we could
not verify the propriety of the payments.

and we could not determine the propriety of the related payments selected
for review.
Background
Our data matches disclosed payments totaling approximately $1.3 million during
the period of our review to three entities (a private university, a nationally
recognized non-profit focused on cardiovascular health, and a Baltimore City
community organization) that had non-financial relationships with three Board
members. According to UMMS management, these payments were for a
combination of sponsorships and services provided to UMMS, and were initiated
by UMMS management (exclusive of the Board’s input).
Procurement
UMMS did not competitively procure the services provided by the three entities.
Specifically, UMMS did not document its justification for not competitively
procuring a contract to one entity for guide services in the areas surrounding an
UMMS medical center. UMMS could not provide copies of contracts with the
other two entities for access to medical data and medical training courses.
UMMS also made certain sponsorship payments to these three entities in addition
to the services provided by the entities. For example, UMMS purchased tickets to
one of the entity’s annual fundraising event. We were advised that UMMS
periodically made payments at UMMS management’s discretion (exclusive of the
Board’s input) to entities that were aligned with UMMS’ mission or provided a
community benefit or a service related to a community health need. However,
UMMS did not document its justification for selecting these specific entities (for
example, the national non-profit) and the dollar amount of the payments.
Payments
UMMS did not effectively monitor the services provided. Our test of three
payments totaling $37,650 to one entity for guide services disclosed that the
payments were in accordance with the contract rates. However, UMMS could not
64

--- Page 67 ---
provide documentation (such as timesheets) to support that the services billed
were provided. As noted above, UMMS could not provide us with contracts
related to the services obtained from the other two entities nor could UMMS
identify an employee responsible for monitoring these two entities.
Consequently, we were unable to verify the propriety of any of the five payments
for these services that we tested totaling $22,950.
In regard to the sponsorship payments to the three entities, UMMS management
could not provide evidence that it received certain items (such as tickets to
fundraising events) that were to be received for certain sponsorships or donations.
However, UMMS advised that the purpose of the payments was to sponsor the
entities and not to receive specific benefits.
Objective 4
Recommendations
Objective and Methodology
Our objective was to make recommendations regarding how best to evaluate the
procurement and contracting processes and any contracts with and payments to
UMMS affiliated hospitals and members of the Board of Directors of UMMS or
the members of the boards of directors of the affiliated hospitals.
To accomplish this objective, we considered the understanding of UMMS’
procurement and disbursement processes and procedures that we obtained during
work performed during Objective 2, as well as the results of the tests we
performed during Objective 3. We also reviewed the results of the internal review
of the Board of Directors’ policies and procedures and the financial management
practices performance audit22 that were conducted in accordance with the
requirements of Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019. As noted in Table
7, both the internal review and performance audit reports contained a number of
recommended actions for UMMS to implement. Copies of the internal review
and performance audit reports are available at the Department of Legislative
Services Library. At the time of our reporting, the reports of the internal review
and performance audit were available at the following links, respectively:
Report of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors University of
Maryland Medical System

22 As required by Section 2(a)(3)(ii) of Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019, we consulted
with the certified public accounting firm selected by UMMS on the scope and objectives of the
firm’s performance audit.

Conclusion
As noted in the aforementioned reports there were significant deficiencies
identified with UMMS’ procurement and disbursement policies and procedures.
The results of our work generally confirmed these deficiencies. Those reports
also included recommended actions to implement the establishment of new, or the
enhancement of existing, processes, and controls.
In our opinion, if UMMS successfully implements the recommendations
contained in the two referenced reports, further recommendations regarding
UMMS’ procurement and contracting processes, additional business relationships,
and other related parties should not be necessary. In addition, while it is possible
that further evaluation by the Office of Legislative Audits would disclose
additional business relationships, our ability to assess the propriety of these
relationships would likely be hindered by the absence of a comprehensive
procurement policy and the pervasive lack of available supporting documentation
that we highlighted in Objectives 2 and 3.
Therefore, we believe it is critical for UMMS to implement the recommended
corrective actions contained in the internal review and financial management
practices performance audit reports. Once implemented, UMMS should
periodically conduct internal audits to ensure that procurements and
66

--- Page 69 ---
disbursements are in compliance with its policies and that internal controls are
functioning as designed.

Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
Scope
We conducted a review of certain activities of the University of Maryland
Medical System Corporation (UMMS) in accordance with Section 3 of Chapters
18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019. Specifically, the law required the Office of
Legislative Audits (OLA) to:
 identify all of the members of the UMMS Board of Directors and each
member’s associated businesses23;
 obtain all disbursement records from UMMS;
 identify all contracts with or payments to the members of the Board of
Directors and a member’s associated businesses;
 identify the basis for the procurement and the UMMS official and department
that initiated and approved the payment;
 identify the procurement method used and test for the propriety of the
procurement, including whether it was conducted in accordance with a formal
UMMS policy and whether the full Board of Directors approved the contract
or payment;
 evaluate whether all proper steps were taken and, if a payment or contract was
sole source, whether the rationale was documented and supportable;
 evaluate whether the contract or payment to a member of the Board of
Directors or the member’s associated businesses was monitored effectively to
ensure that all deliverables paid for were provided; and
 make recommendations regarding how best to evaluate the procurement and
contracting processes and any contracts with and payments to UMMS
affiliated hospitals and members of the UMMS Board of Directors or the
members of the boards of directors of the affiliated hospitals.
Although the aforementioned laws required us to conduct a forensic audit of
UMMS, we consider this report to be a special review and not a forensic audit due
to certain restrictions encountered during our field work as described in further
detail below. Because of those restrictions, the scope of our review was less than
that of an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted government
23 Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019 do not define the “associated businesses” that were
to be identified by our review. Therefore, we included any entity, regardless of whether it
operated as for-profit or not-for-profit, with which the Board members or their immediate
family member (spouses and adult children) (a) held an ownership interest (excluding non-
controlling interests in publicly traded stock), (b) was employed, (c) received income, or
(d) served as a member of the entity’s board of directors or equivalent governing body.

auditing standards. Our review was conducted during the period from April 2019
through November 2019.
UMMS Imposed Limitations on OLA Access
Generally accepted government auditing standards require that we plan and
perform an audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable
basis for our findings and conclusions. We believe that the restrictions imposed
by UMMS on our access to its employees and records detailed below precluded
us from obtaining such evidence. Therefore, our review did not constitute an
audit as defined by those standards. In addition, if we had conducted an audit,
other matters may have come to our attention that would have been included in
this report.
As a consequence of these limitations and delays, and the resultant impact on our
ability to complete our work timely, we requested and were granted an extension
of the statutorily established report due date from the General Assembly’s
presiding officers. Specifically, on October 31, 2019, the Legislative Auditor
formally requested a report due date extension to March 13, 2020 (see Exhibit 1).
In a letter dated November 7, 2019, the Senate President and the Speaker of the
House approved the requested extension (see Exhibit 2).
Lack of Readily Available Documentation
For each disbursement that we identified from UMMS to a Board member or their
associated business, we requested UMMS to provide support for the
disbursements and related procurements including bidding documents, executed
contracts, invoices, and evidence that UMMS received the required deliverables.
Although we initially requested these documents in June 2019, UMMS did not
provide certain documents until November 2019. In addition, and as further
explained in Objective 3 of our report, UMMS ultimately could not provide all of
the requested documentation for the majority of the transactions that we
identified. Ultimately, the lack of available documentation prevented us from
being able to conclude on certain matters, including the extent to which Board
members were aware of, or involved in, the procurements and related payments to
their associated businesses or those of their immediate family members.
Limitations on OLA Access to UMMS Employees
For each disbursement that we identified from UMMS to a Board member or their
associated business, we requested UMMS to identify employees with direct
involvement in the procurement and/or monitoring of the related contracts.
Although our initial request was made in June 2019, UMMS did not permit us to
meet with certain of the employees it identified until October 2019. In addition, a
69

--- Page 72 ---
number of the employees UMMS identified were senior management officials
who were not directly involved in the transactions. Furthermore, UMMS could
not identify any employees involved in the procurement and/or monitoring of
certain contracts, including contracts that appeared to still be active, based on
current disbursement activity, as of the time of our review. According to UMMS
management, it was unable to identify these employees due to the decentralized
nature of its operations. Finally, UMMS management advised us that certain
responsible individuals were no longer employed by UMMS at the time of our
review.
Limitations on OLA Access to Email Records
In June 2019, we requested copies of the email records for five UMMS
employees, including key senior management, procurement, and accounts payable
personnel. We selected these employees based on their potential involvement in
procuring or paying Board members and their associated businesses.
UMMS legal counsel advised legal counsel to the Maryland General Assembly
that there were approximately 1.6 million emails associated with our request.
UMMS legal counsel further advised that it would need to review each email
before providing them to us to ensure the emails did not contain information that
was protected by UMMS’ attorney-client privilege. Citing the time and resources
necessary to complete such a review, UMMS offered to provide a limited number
of emails based on UMMS-developed search criteria, as well as key words or
terms of our choice. We advised UMMS that this methodology was not
acceptable since we would be unable to verify that UMMS conducted the work in
accordance with any agreed upon protocols, and it provided no assurance that we
would receive all of the emails relevant to our work. For example, our research
disclosed additional associated business entities that were not included on
UMMS’ proposed list of search criteria.
Ultimately, on its own initiative, in September 2019 UMMS provided us with
14,500 emails that it identified using the UMMS-developed search criteria and its
own terms and key words. When provided to us, some of these emails were
heavily redacted. For example, a November 2017 email we reviewed indicated
that the attached meeting minutes included discussion on executive compensation.
Such information may have disclosed that Board members who received
payments from UMMS were involved in decisions related to the compensation of
UMMS employees who authorized payments to the Board members (indicating a
potential conflict of interest). UMMS redacted the entire contents of the minutes,
beyond the issues related to specific compensation (see Exhibit 4). We further
noted that certain emails between UMMS and third parties were likewise redacted
when provided to us. In one instance, we noted an email to a corporate reputation
70

--- Page 73 ---
agency which appeared to be related to the activities subject to our review.
UMMS redacted the entire contents of this email citing the aforementioned
attorney-client privilege. Finally, UMMS did not provide the email records in the
electronic format we had discussed when making our original request.
Specifically, UMMS provided the 14,500 emails in approximately 110,000
individual image files, with each file containing a single page of an email or
related attachment. We had originally requested the emails in a format that would
have enabled us to conduct electronic searches of the emails to assist in our
review; an option that was not possible with the image files provided by UMMS.
Objectives and Methodology
Based on the requirements established in law, our objectives were to:
1. identify all members of the UMMS Board of Directors for the period from
January 1, 2016 through April 18, 2019;
2. identify all contracts with or payments to the members of the Board of
Directors and their associated businesses during the period from January
1, 2016 through April 18, 2019;
3. assess UMMS’ procurement of goods and services from members of its
Board of Directors and their associated businesses, and to determine
whether the related contracts and payments were monitored effectively to
ensure that all deliverables paid for were received; and
4. make recommendations regarding how best to evaluate the procurement
and contracting processes and any contracts with and payments to UMMS
affiliated hospitals and members of the Board of Directors of UMMS or
the members of the boards of directors of the affiliated hospitals.
Our review consisted of tests, analyses, observations, and discussions with
UMMS personnel (subject to the limitations discussed above) as we deemed
necessary to achieve our objectives. More detailed descriptions of the specific
objectives and related methodologies are discussed in the Findings and
Recommendations section of this report.
The response from UMMS to our findings is included as Appendix A to this
report. Auditor’s comments to the UMMS response can be found in Appendix B.

Re: Response of the University of Maryland Medical System
Dear Mr. Hook:
The University of Maryland Medical System (“UMMS”) appreciates the opportunity to
review and respond to the draft Special Review (“Draft Report”) prepared by your office. We
appreciate the time and effort you and your staff committed to this work and, in particular, want
to thank Mr. Fowler, Mr. Rubenstein, and Mr. Tanen for their professionalism and collegiality
over the course of the past nine months.
Most importantly, we want to assure you that the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and
management of UMMS, along with its 28,000 employees, share the General Assembly’s interest
in ensuring that UMMS has appropriate, effective governance and management procedures,
including with respect to potential conflicts of interest by its volunteer Board members. UMMS
acknowledges - as multiple audits, reviews, and self-assessments found last year - that during the
time period in question, there were significant weaknesses in UMMS’ control environment that
allowed conflicts of interest to benefit some Board members personally. The Special
Committee’s investigation, initiated in September 2019, focused on the root causes of those
governance failures and, along with the December 2019 Performance Audit, proposed numerous
reforms.

We appreciate the Draft Report’s conclusion that “if UMMS successfully implements the
recommendations contained in the two referenced reports, further recommendations regarding
UMMS’ procurement and contracting processes, additional business relationships, and other
related parties should not be necessary.” The Board and management have already made
substantial progress on implementing the new policies and procedures recommended by the
Special Committee and the Performance Audit, as well as the recommendations made by the
Board’s Governance and Nominating Committee. As set forth below, that remedial work
continues.
Taking Strong, Comprehensive Remedial Action
UMMS agrees with OLA’s implicit criticism of the procurement policies and practices in
place over the past several years. As detailed in the Special Committee’s Report, the policies and
operations of the Board prior to 2019 were fundamentally flawed and permitted numerous
conflicts of interest to occur. Both the new Board and management are committed to addressing
these failings and ensuring that, going forward, the governance and oversight of UMMS is
effective, efficient, and consistent with best practices. To that end, in the past nine months, the
Board – comprised primarily of newly appointed members – and UMMS management have
taken significant steps to address and remediate these weaknesses. In particular, with respect to:
• Conflicts of Interest – UMMS has adopted a new Conflicts of Interest Policy (“COI
Policy”) whereby a conflict of interest is defined as an interest that may affect, or may
reasonably appear to affect, the judgment or conduct of any covered person in a manner
that is adverse to the interests of UMMS. The COI Policy requires all conflicted
transactions with Board members or their families to be approved by the full Board and
prohibits the Chair of the Board and the Chairs of the Governance and Nominating
Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee (or their family members) from
having any business transactions with UMMS.
• Charitable Contributions – The Governance and Nominating Committee has developed a
policy to establish a procedure for the review and approval of charitable contributions
and sponsorships.
• Directors as Vendors – The Board has adopted a policy and a process by which the Board
may evaluate the appropriateness of individual directors simultaneously serving while in
a vendor relationship with UMMS (whether directly or indirectly, including through
family members) in a manner consistent with state law and the COI Policy.
• Procurement Discretion – UMMS is implementing a Contract Management Policy (“CM
Policy”) to create common processes and accountability for contract execution and
management across UMMS. The CM Policy will integrate conflict of interest processes
into the practice of contract management, will provide guidelines for contracting and
bidding, and will establish thresholds for Board approval.

In addition, many other remedial measures were adopted by the Board in 2019. The Audit
and Compliance Committee is actively monitoring implementation of these measures.
Disagreements With Draft Report
UMMS strongly disagrees with two main aspects of the Draft Report.
First, UMMS takes issue with the Draft Report’s repeated criticisms of the cooperation of
UMMS management with your office. OLA’s criticism appears to stem from the belief that
anything less than completely unfettered access to UMMS’ records and employees is “non-
cooperation.” This view is unfair and unrealistic. The standard business practices proposed by
UMMS for the management of information requests, whether interviews with employees or the
delivery of documents, are commonly used and accepted by other government investigators. We
are confident that an objective review of the facts, including the voluminous correspondence
between OLA and UMMS, bears this out. We respectfully urge you to reconsider this criticism.
Second, the scope, approach, and protocols employed by OLA in the Draft Report
identify transactions as potential conflicts of interest where there was no evidence or even a
suggestion of personal benefit to the “associated” Board member(s) or their family members. By
way of example, the Draft Report identifies numerous “disbursements” that are simply charitable
donations to Maryland and national non-profit organizations. For instance, the Draft Report
identifies UMMS’ sponsorship of the as a “disbursement” to an
“associated business entity” of three different Board members solely because those Board
members also serve – as volunteers – on the board of the . UMMS believes it is
appropriate for one of the state’s largest private-sector employers to support the communities it
serves, and the fact of a common Board member between UMMS and a community institution
does not – and should not – render that institution undeserving of UMMS’ support. As discussed
in further detail below, we believe that the overbreadth of OLA’s findings and its definition of
“associated businesses” inappropriately taint the people and entities involved, including UMMS,
and does not advance the shared goal of improving the governance of UMMS. Again, we
respectfully urge you to reconsider this approach.
Correcting The Record On UMMS’ Cooperation With OLA
The Draft Report’s repeated criticism that UMMS did not cooperate with the audit is
unfounded and misstates key facts. As stated above, UMMS is a private, not-for-profit healthcare
company and, as such, differs significantly from the state agencies that OLA typically reviews.
Disclosures of confidential information to an outside third-party, including a state agency, can in
some cases be a violation of law or, at minimum, act as a waiver of any future claim of
confidentiality. As a healthcare provider, UMMS is heavily regulated and has numerous

obligations implicating patient privacy,1 employee privacy, the secure preservation of data, and
privileged legal advice. In addition, UMMS operates in a highly competitive marketplace, where
the protection of confidential business information is a key priority.
Against this backdrop, in June 2019 OLA demanded that UMMS provide all emails of
five members of UMMS management – more than 1.6 million emails – without any limitation on
subject matter of the documents, any method to protect the privacy or privilege interests of
UMMS, or any regard for the relevance of the documents to OLA’s assignment. As is routine
among companies responding to government information requests, UMMS proposed narrowing
the data set by using search terms, with OLA’s consideration and agreement, to reduce the 1.6
million emails to a more manageable and relevant set based on the subject matter of the
communications. UMMS also expressed its desire to review the narrower set of emails prior to
delivery to OLA in order to ascertain legal privilege and other confidentiality concerns, such as
those involving patient privacy. This routine protocol would not have compromised OLA’s
audit – just as it does not compromise the investigations of law enforcement agencies, healthcare
regulators, or other government agencies that commonly permit and encourage this approach.
Indeed, UMMS used search terms and reviewed documents for privileged and confidential
information when it provided documents subpoenaed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in
connection with its investigation of .
OLA makes several criticisms of UMMS’ cooperation with OLA’s requests for email
records, including that UMMS did not provide assurances that OLA would receive relevant
emails, that emails were heavily redacted, and that UMMS provided emails in an unsearchable
format. However, the record shows that UMMS provided an initial list of search terms in
June 2019 and offered to provide OLA additional search terms to the extent OLA had further
inquiries throughout the investigation. (OLA never asked to supplement this initial list.) Second,
UMMS only withheld or redacted a small number of documents that were deemed privileged or
that contained private patient data (such as personally identifying information (“PII”), including
the names and identification numbers of Medicare patients). Of the 14,809 documents that
UMMS produced, only 141 documents (.95%) had privilege redactions and only 52 documents
(.35%) had PII redactions. UMMS produced the documents to OLA on September 3, 2019. At no
point prior to issuing its Draft Report did OLA raise questions or concerns regarding these
redactions. Yet, the Draft Report seeks to paint an alternative picture of the redactions. Lastly,
UMMS did in fact produce documents in standard, searchable format, which could have been
explained if the issue were raised prior to the delivery of the Draft Report.
The Draft Report also suggests that disbursement documentation was not “readily
available” and that OLA’s access to UMMS employees was delayed and/or limited. UMMS
disagrees. UMMS sought to provide OLA with access to available business records and UMMS
1 As a “covered entity” governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), UMMS must
protect the privacy and security of the “protected health information” or “PHI” it maintains, and may only use and disclose PHI in accordance
with HIPAA. Where permitted to disclose PHI to a “health oversight agency” for appropriate oversight activities, UMMS must also only provide
the minimum necessary PHI.

employees in a timely and orderly manner that respected both the employees’ and UMMS’ legal
rights and OLA’s interest in access to information. Businesses do not responsibly allow third
parties, even government agencies, to question their employees without regard for responsible
business practices and their legal rights and duties. UMMS acted reasonably in trying to establish
an orderly process and did not deny OLA access to any employee.
Finally, the Draft Report asserts that UMMS’ supposed lack of cooperation prevented
OLA from carrying out its legislative mandate under Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland
2019. There is no factual basis for that conclusion. Under Section 3(a) of the Act, OLA was
tasked with seven objectives, including identifying members of the Board and their associated
businesses, and obtaining disbursement records from UMMS – both of which UMMS
facilitated.2 Beyond that, UMMS provided substantial additional help, including producing
emails, contract documentation, and numerous witnesses to assist OLA, and meeting with you
and your staff on many occasions. UMMS did not prevent OLA from completing any of the
seven objectives identified by the statute.
Response to Expenditures Identified by OLA
As the Special Committee found, prior to March 2019, “significant aspects of the Board’s
effectiveness as an oversight and decision-making body were deeply compromised, not only by
the self-interested transactions of a group of Board members, but by structural and operational
flaws in the Board’s organization and operation.”3 Self-interested transactions in which volunteer
Board members received financial benefits, directly or indirectly, from UMMS – even when
properly disclosed – did not adhere to UMMS policies, follow best-practices for non-profit
organizations, or honor the System’s community mission and principles. Deficiencies in UMMS’
procurement and payment processes, as identified by the Special Committee, likewise
contributed to the overall weak control environment that allowed self-interested transactions to
occur.
Instead of focusing on conflicted transactions and control deficiencies, the Draft Report
employs an overreaching definition of “associated businesses” and identifies dozens of
2 According to Section 3(a), OLA was required to conduct a forensic audit of UMMS for January 2016-April 2019 that: (1) identifies all of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Medical System Corporation and each member’s associated businesses; (2) obtains all disbursement
records from the Medical System Corporation; (3) identifies all contracts with or payments to the members of the Board of Directors and a
member’s associated businesses; (4) identifies the basis for the procurement and the Medical System Corporation official and department that
initiated and approved the payment; (5) identifies the procurement method used and tests for propriety of the procurement, including whether it
was conducted in accordance with a formal Medical System Corporation policy and whether the full Board of Directors approved the contract or
payment; (6) evaluates whether all proper steps were taken and, if a payment or contract was sole source, whether the rationale was documented
and supportable; and (7) evaluates whether the contract or payment made to a member of the Board of Directors or the member’s associated
business was monitored effectively to ensure that all deliverables paid for were provided. University of Maryland Medical System Corporation-

disbursements and charitable contributions,4 amounting to tens of millions of dollars, that were
in no way tainted by the self-interest of a Board member or officer. In doing so, it leaves the
impression that these proper business transactions and contributions somehow exhibited the
same breakdown in processes and controls examined by the Special Committee and other
reviews, when in fact they did not. Additionally, OLA notes that it “could not definitively
determine the extent to which the Board members were involved in the UMMS procurements
from or payments to those entities” and that “it is plausible that the Board members may not
have had knowledge of the relationships.” Indeed, for certain of the transactions, financial
interests, and relationships identified, no disclosure by the Board member was required.
Unfortunately, not only does OLA’s audit scope obscure rather than clarify the Board process
problems, it also tarnishes many volunteer community members and organizations that UMMS
supports with purported conflicts of interest where none exist.
A. UMMS and Affiliated Hospitals Support for Charities
The Draft Report identifies numerous charitable donations by UMMS or its affiliate
hospitals to Maryland and national non-profit organizations with which an UMMS Board
member or a family member was associated (in most cases, as a volunteer director or trustee, or,
in one instance, an employee of a regional community service organization).5 UMMS and its
member hospitals take seriously the responsibility to support the communities they serve and are
proud of their contributions to these organizations. Unlike the self-interested transactions that
were the focus of the Special Committee Report, these charitable contributions did not confer a
private financial benefit on a Board member or a family member. The decision to include them
in the scope of the OLA audit tarnishes these community organizations and the volunteers who
lead them. For example:
• Charitable support of $180,625 to the , which is
characterized as an “associated business” solely because it is also supported by the
private business of Board Member 1, conferred no discernible private benefit on Board
Member 1.
• Charitable support of $979,071 to , where of Board
Member 1 was a trustee, conferred no discernible private benefit on Board Member 1.
• Charitable support of $151,070 for the where Board
Member 2, Board Member 6, Board Member 16, Board Member 22, and of Board
4 Chapters 18 and 19, Laws of Maryland 2019 did not define the “associated businesses” that were to be identified by OLA’s review. OLA
therefore defined “associated business” as “any entity, regardless of whether it operated as for-profit or not-for-profit, with which the Board
members or their immediate family member [spouse or adult child] (a) held an ownership interest (excluding non-controlling interests in publicly
traded stock), (b) was employed, (c) received income, or (d) served as a member of the entity’s board of directors or equivalent governing body.”
5 Although UMMS was not able to independently verify all purported relationships between Board members and “associated businesses,” or the
existence of or amounts of related disbursements, it accepts the Draft Report's assertions on both matters for purposes of providing this response.

Member 1 served as volunteer directors, conferred no discernible private benefit on
Board Members 1, 2, 6, 16, or 22.
• Charitable support of $254,210 for the , on which
Board Member 16 served as a volunteer director, conferred no discernible private benefit
on Board Member 16.
• Charitable support of $220,240 for the , on
which Board Member 19 serves as a volunteer director, conferred no discernible private
benefit on Board Member 19.
As reflected in the Special Committee Report, UMMS agrees with OLA’s conclusion that
improved policies are needed to ensure a more objective, deliberative decision-making process
for UMMS’ charity support program, among other things. Those process improvements are
underway. However, UMMS firmly believes that supporting community organizations is an
appropriate role for UMMS to play and disagrees with the implication that these contributions
are tainted by conflicts of interest.
B. UMMS Business Expenditures That Conferred No Private Benefit on
Board Members
The Draft Report identifies private businesses, clubs, and associations as “associated
businesses” where the only connection between UMMS and the “associated business” is a
common member or director. Doing so suggests the Board member benefited personally from the
business/club/association’s transaction with UMMS and that it represented a conflict of interest.
UMMS disputes that characterization. For example:
• Payments of $132,455 to a local city club for membership and expenses, where Board
Member 2 is also a member, conferred no discernible private benefit on Board Member 2.
• Payments of $4,120,815 in dues to the for
UMMS’ 13 member hospitals’ participation in the , where Board Member 6 served
as a director and Vice Chairman, conferred no discernible private benefit on Board
Member 6.
• Payments of $21,950 for advertising on community news sites on the Eastern Shore. The
Draft Report attributes this transaction to Board Member 14 solely based on his service as
a volunteer director of the . is a
non-profit organization that acts as a disbursing agent for over 400 non-profits, each of
which has its own separate component fund. There is no evidence the transaction
conferred a discernible private benefit on Board Member 14 or that he was even aware of
it.

Hook, Gregory A.

The Draft Report also includes in its calculation of “total disbursements” almost $58
million in payments to insurance companies, which in large part represents insurance premiums
passed on by UMMS or its affiliates to those insurers. The Draft Report also includes a $4
million pass-through payment to an escrow agent for a land purchase (as discussed below in
Section D). As the vast majority of these payments are pass-throughs, the $62 million does not
reflect a benefit conferred on an entity associated with a Board member.
C. UMMS or Affiliate Hospital Expenditures for Practicing Physician
The Draft Report identifies payments of $2,352,985 to the medical practice of Board
Member 10, a practicing physician affiliated with the . The
relationship between the medical practice and the was disclosed as required and widely
known during Board Member 10’s service on the UMMS Board. The payments were to Board
Member 10’s group practice for call coverage services and medical director services. As
discussed with OLA, all payment amounts have written, contemporaneous substantiation.
Although the payments to the medical practice were not formally approved by the UMMS
Board, these services are the type for which appropriate non-Board service-related compensation
for a Board member is contemplated by the UMMS bylaws. In addition, as noted by the Draft
Report (see note 16), Board Member 10’s contract with predated merger with
UMMS and Board Member 10’s service on the UMMS Board.
D. Additional Relationships Where No Disclosure Was Required
The Draft Report identifies 1,077 payments totaling $6,967,654 to three companies with
a common parent (“Vendor A”, “Vendor B”, and “Vendor D”) associated with Board Member 4.
The Draft Report does not disclose that Board Member 4 has not worked for the parent
corporation (“Parent”) since 2010 – six years before his appointment to the Board – or that the
payments to Board Member 4 are interest on deferred compensation owed by the Parent to Board
Member 4 as part of a retirement plan. Board Member 4 has not had a management or ownership
interest in the Parent in the time he has served as an UMMS director. The Disclosure of Financial
Interest form did not require disclosure of these interest payments, which also did not violate the
Board Conflict of Interest Policy.
Further exemplifying the overreach of the Draft Report, it also included 1,021 payments
totaling $5,103,455 to a group of companies (“Vendor 4C”) that the Draft Report states “had a
direct financial connection to a vendor from which Board Member 4 received financial
compensation.” We understand the “direct financial connection” is merely a common investor in,
or owner betweenVendor 4C and the separate Parent company that owns 4A, 4B, and 4D. We
are aware of no evidence that Board Member 4 had any financial connection to “Vendor 4C,”
and the Draft Report does not substantiate that conclusion.
The Draft Report also identifies two payments totaling $4,107,354 to Vendor 5A and 87
payments totaling $2,652,827 to Vendor 5B, associated with Board Member 5. The payments to

--- Page 96 ---
Hook, Gregory A.
March 6, 2020
Page 9.
Vendor 5A – a pass-through escrow payment for which the law firm of Board Member 5 served
as escrow agent for the party opposite to UMMS – related to a real estate transaction completed
before Board Member 5 was appointed to the Board. This financial transaction was not required
to be disclosed on the Disclosure of Financial Interest form and did not violate the Board
Conflict of Interest Policy. OLA’s decision to include the full $4.1 million escrow payment as a
“disbursement to vendor” leaves the impression that Board Member 5 profited from the
transaction by more than $4 million, which is incorrect. Similarly, the $2.7 million in payments
to Vendor 5B primarily consisted of payments by on a loan
that predated Board Member 5’s appointment to the Board by three years. Vendor 5B is a
subsidiary of a publicly traded company, of which Board Member 5 owns far less than three
percent, and therefore Board Member 5’s stock ownership does not require disclosure or violate
the Board Conflict of Interest Policy. As a stockholder in a public corporation, it is misleading to
suggest that Board Member 5 personally benefited from debt repayments of almost $2.7 million.
Call for Transparency
Finally, it is our understanding that OLA intends to release its report to the General
Assembly and public without disclosing the names of the Board members, businesses, and
charities that form the focus of the Draft Report. UMMS strongly urges you to reconsider. In the
past year, the new Board leadership and management of UMMS have made transparency a core
principle of governance. That is why, even though UMMS is a private entity, the Board
authorized the full disclosure of the Special Committee’s Report in December 2019.
Furthermore, lack of disclosure will merely fuel speculation as to the thinly veiled identities of
the people and institutions addressed by the Draft Report and serve to make transactions appear
nefarious when they are anything but. While we disagree with your findings for the reasons
explained above, masking the true facts underlying your conclusions will do more harm than
good. UMMS strongly believes in the critical values of transparency and accountability and
urges you to make your findings fully public.
Conclusion
UMMS recognizes and applauds OLA’s efforts to provide a fact-based and detailed
report. UMMS further recognizes that the Board’s governance and management controls were
deficient prior to the recent reforms. As such, the concerns outlined above are not aimed at or in
any way intended to minimize the Draft Report findings that point to legitimate breakdowns in
corporate governance. To the contrary, please be assured that these findings are welcome and
will inform our remediation work, which has been underway for nine months. Perhaps most
importantly, UMMS and OLA agree that, once the remedial measures set forth in the Special
Committee and other reports are fully implemented, UMMS will have a set of governance
policies and oversight mechanisms that will serve the organization, its hospitals and other
facilities, its employees, its patients, and the communities that it serves for many years to come.
It is UMMS’ sincere hope that this Draft Report can be an aid in achieving the shared goal of

restoring efficient, effective, and visionary leadership for the University of Maryland Medical
System. UMMS believes that OLA’s review completes the extensive round of audits,
investigations, and reviews into these governance issues to allow UMMS to move forward with
complete focus on providing highest level of quality and compassionate patient care.

Appendix B
Auditor’s Comments on UMMS Response
Although UMMS generally agrees with our findings, it disputes that limitations
were imposed on our access to its records (including emails) and employees, and
disagrees with our basis for including certain disbursements in our report.
Disagreement on UMMS Cooperation
In regard to the limitations imposed on our access, UMMS disputes that (a) it did
not comply with our request for certain employees’ emails and (b) it did not make
its employees and documentation available to us.
(a) Emails – UMMS cited its obligation to protect confidential and legally
privileged information as well as the routine protocols established among
companies responding to government information requests as the basis for not
providing us with all of the requested emails. UMMS further asserts that it
provided us with emails and offered to conduct additional queries at our request.
There are several factors that support our comments regarding the emails.
Specifically, UMMS discounts the three-month delay between our initial request
for the emails in June and the ultimate delivery of the limited number of emails in
September. As we advised UMMS senior executive management on a number of
occasions, access to the emails after a certain point would impair the usefulness of
the data for our review given the time needed to analyze, corroborate, and develop
appropriate follow up on the results. Furthermore, the extent to which UMMS
screened and redacted these emails raised questions as to completeness of the
emails that would be provided. Finally, the routine protocols referenced by
UMMS in its response demonstrates a lack of appreciation for the unprecedented
nature of the legislation mandating our work and its related scope.
(b) Access to records and personnel - UMMS contends that documentation and
employees were made readily available to OLA during the audit.
As noted in our report, there were extensive delays between our repeated requests
for documents and personnel with whom to discuss the procurements. Ultimately,
there were numerous instances in which UMMS could not provide the requested
documentation or identify responsible employees, including those related to
contracts that appeared to still be active at the time of our review. While these
delays may have been the result of systemic procedural deficiencies that have
been acknowledged by UMMS, the delays ultimately impaired our ability to
determine the source, nature, and propriety of numerous transactions identified.

--- Page 99 ---
Disagreement on Inclusion of Certain Disbursements
UMMS believes that OLA employed an overreaching definition of associated
businesses. UMMS disagrees with the inclusion of several associated businesses
in our report for which (a) OLA did not demonstrate that the respective Board
member(s) had a financial interest and (b) for which UMMS disputes the extent
and timing of the financial relationship with the Board members and/or that the
transactions presented a conflict of interest.
(a) We are explicit throughout our report that we could not definitively determine
that Board members were aware of, involved in, or benefited from the payments,
nor that the transactions we identified were improper. The format used to present
the transactions in Table 5 (page 19) and our related comments clearly labeled the
transactions highlighted in the UMMS response as associated businesses for
which we could not demonstrate a financial benefit to the respective Board
member(s).
While we acknowledge and respect UMMS’ contributions to these entities, there
was a lack of transparency, policies and procedures, and documentation to support
the source, nature, and the overall propriety of many of these payments.
Furthermore, as noted in our introductory comments in the Other Associated
Business Entities section (page 60), payments to legitimate and otherwise
respectable charities can be used for questionable purposes. Therefore, we felt
compelled and deemed it appropriate to include these disbursements in our report
to comply with the mandate of Section 3(a)(3) of Chapter 18, Laws of Maryland
2019 which required us to identify all contracts with or payments to a member’s
associated businesses.
(b) Our review of available documentation clearly demonstrates that Board
Members 4, 5, and 10, highlighted in the UMMS response, have a financial
interest in the associated business (or another business with a direct financial
connection to the associated business). The legislation mandating our review did
not distinguish between the type and timing of the financial relationship and
therefore, we believe it was appropriate to include them in the scope of our
review. In addition, due to the lack of policies and procedures and documentation
to support the source, nature, and propriety of many of these payments, we could
not conclude on the extent to which these transactions presented a conflict of
interest.
In regard to the specific concerns raised by UMMS for Board Member 4, as noted
above and in our comments on pages 33-37, using State and UMMS records, we
were able to establish a direct financial relationship between the Board Member

--- Page 100 ---
and the associated businesses included in our report. The terms of employment
and nature of the compensation was not included in the scope of our review and
do not contradict any of the facts presented. In regard to Board Member 5, our
comments on the associated businesses (pages 37-38) clearly explain the nature of
the payments to Vendor 5A, and we did not test Vendor 5B, but the relationship
was nevertheless disclosed to us by the Board Member in response to our
questionnaire. In regard to Board Member 10, UMMS asserts that the nature of
the activity is appropriate, but acknowledges the relationship was not formally
approved by the Board. As noted in our comments on pages 41-42, UMMS could
not provide document to support the propriety of the procurement and the related
payments to support these assertions.
Disclosure of Board Member and Associated Business Names
UMMS requested that we disclose the names of the Board members and
associated businesses included in Objectives 2 and 3. However, as noted on page
18 we believe that such information should be excluded from the report given the
focus of our review.
