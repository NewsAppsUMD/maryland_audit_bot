Mr. Karl S. Aro, Executive Director
Department of Legislative Services
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In accordance with Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland,
we have performed desk reviews of the audit reports filed by each county,
incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2006. The desk reviews consisted of assessments of compliance with
accounting and auditing standards, evaluations of compliance with certain State
laws, and analyses of selected financial data to identify potential financial
problems.
Most of the local governments and their independent auditors substantially
complied with accounting and auditing standards for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2006. Nevertheless, we identified instances of noncompliance with certain
requirements of our audit guidelines, generally accepted accounting principles,
and/or generally accepted auditing standards. Letters were sent to 75 local
governments and to their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies
disclosed by our reviews so that corrective actions could be taken to help ensure
future compliance.

--- Page 4 ---
The financial statements disclosed 15 local governments with uninsured/
uncollateralized bank deposits, which is an area of noncompliance with State law.
The financial statements also disclosed that 1 local government held investments
in common stock, in violation of State law. In addition, our desk reviews
identified 8 local governments with potential financial problems (such as deficit
fund balances or unfavorable financial trends). Where appropriate, letters were
sent to these local governments, and to their legislative representatives, to
communicate their noncompliance or potential financial problems, and to request
that the local governments advise us of the corrective actions that will be taken.
Respectfully submitted,
Bruce A. Myers, CPA
Legislative Auditor

Introduction and Scope
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires each
county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland to file annual
(once every four years under specified conditions) audit reports. There were 198
local government audit reports due for fiscal year 2006 (24 counties, 156 cities
and towns, and 18 taxing districts). The reports are to include financial
statements with accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions
as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented. The financial
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. We have prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide
additional information regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing
requirements.
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code requires the Office of Legislative Audits to
perform a desk review of each local government’s annual audit report for
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards.
Subsections (b) through (f) of Section 40 specify the reporting and review
requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by the counties. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is required to
review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2006 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as of six fiscal year 2005 reports (Towns of Burkittsville, Charlestown, Eagle
Harbor, Morningside, and Williamsport, and the Washington Suburban Transit
Commission), and of four fiscal year 2004 reports (Towns of Burkittsville,
Charlestown, Eagle Harbor, and Morningside) received subsequent to our
previous review. The desk reviews were performed to accomplish the following
tasks:
• Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and accounting and
auditing standards, using a checklist for governmental audits published by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
• Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits)
4

--- Page 7 ---
• Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances, underfunded pension plans, or unfavorable trends and ratios,
based on analyses of financial data over the most recent five-year period (July
1, 2001 through June 30, 2006)
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2006 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
Four local governments had not filed an audit report for fiscal year 2006.
Thirty-nine local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date.
Four local governments had not filed an audit report for fiscal year 2006.
Furthermore, 39 local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date. The failure of a local government to file an audit, or a delay in filing,
results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The submission of audit
reports after the required filing date was also noted for 14 of these 39 local
governments during our preceding year’s review. Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Annotated Code of Maryland requires audit reports to be filed by November 1
after the close of the fiscal year, or by January 1 after the close of the fiscal year
for those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 had not been received, as of
August 30, 2007, for the following four local governments:
1. Town of East New Market
2. Town of Forest Heights
3. City of Glenarden
4. Mount Savage Special Taxing Area
We will review these fiscal year 2006 audit reports and take any follow-up action
necessary when they are received. The results of these reviews will be included
in the report on our review of fiscal year 2007 local government audit reports.
The Towns of Marydel and Templeville requested and were granted waivers from
filing audit reports in fiscal year 2006 because they met the conditions for filing
an audit report every fourth year as provided for under Article 19, Section 40(a).
These entities will next be required to file an audit report for fiscal year 2009.
The Towns of Brookview, Church Creek, Eldorado, Galestown, Henderson,
Hillsboro, and Queen Anne had previously requested and were granted waivers
from filing audit reports. These towns will next be required to file an audit report
for fiscal year 2008.

The audit report for one local government contained an adverse opinion and
one other local government’s report contained a qualified opinion but did not
appropriately identify the opinion units affected.
The audit report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion related
to the discretely presented component unit for fiscal year 2006 due to the
omission of financial data for the Town’s legally separate component unit.
Specifically, the Warfield Development Corporation was determined to be a
component unit of the Town based on criteria established by generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, financial data for the Corporation should be
reported as part of the Town’s financial reporting entity. However, the
Corporation’s financial statements were not included in the Town’s financial
statements because audited financial statements were not available for the
Corporation for the year ended June 30, 2006.
An adverse opinion states that the financial statements for an opinion unit (or for
the financial statements taken as a whole) do not present fairly the financial
position, changes in financial position or, where applicable, cash flows in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
In addition, the audit report for the Town of Williamsport contained a qualified
opinion because of a scope limitation related to inadequacies in the Town’s
accounting records for meter deposits reported in the Electric Fund. However, the
auditor did not distinguish between the opinion units affected by the scope
limitation and those not affected. In this regard, the aforementioned scope
limitation would affect the “each major fund” and “business-type activities”
opinion units, and the opinion should have been qualified for those opinion units.
Conversely, the “governmental activities” and “aggregate remaining fund
information” opinion units would not be affected by the aforementioned scope
limitation and a separate unqualified opinion should have been expressed for
those opinion units as specified by auditing standards.
A qualified opinion is issued when the auditor states that “except for” the effects
of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial statements are
presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Although required by our audit guidelines, the auditors for the Towns of
Sykesville and Williamsport did not submit separate letters to the Office of
Legislative Audits explaining the reasons for the adverse opinion and the
qualified opinion, respectively, and the Towns’ plans to rectify the problems to
enable the auditors to express unqualified opinions in the future.

Auditors’ reports for 30 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for 30 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The auditors’ reports for
11 of these local governmental units included a deficiency that was also cited
during our previous year’s review. The following is a summary of these
deficiencies:
Number of Audit
Area of Noncompliance
Reports
Auditor’s report did not include all basic elements of an 13
audit report (for example, report was not presented in
accordance with the State and Local Governments
Audit Guide published by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants).
Auditor did not express an opinion(s) on all opinion units 9
or on all financial statements.
Auditor’s report did not report on all required information 8
(for example, supplemental information accompanying
the basic financial statements).
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires that audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. These
standards require, in part, that the auditor express an opinion(s) as to whether the
basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position, the respective changes in financial position, and cash flows,
where applicable, of the local government in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Financial statements submitted by 39 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 39 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of 9 of these local governments included two or more such
deficiencies, and the financial statements of 15 of these local governments
included one or more deficiencies that were also cited during our preceding year’s
review.

--- Page 11 ---
The following is a summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of
instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 38
presentation of Statement of Cash Flows was
improper).
All required financial statements were not presented or 15
presentation of statement was inappropriate.
Financial statements and accompanying notes for 19 local governments did
not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
All required information was not included in the financial statements, or in the
accompanying notes, for 19 audit reports. The financial statements of 2 of these
local governments included three areas of insufficient disclosure, and the financial
statements for 4 local governments included an area of insufficient disclosure that
was also cited during our preceding year’s review. Adequate disclosure is
necessary to facilitate the understanding of, and to provide for fair presentation of
the financial information. The following is a summary of these areas of
insufficient disclosure and the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Area of Insufficient Disclosure
Instances
Long-term or short-term debt 8
Basis of accounting or revenue recognition policies 7
Reconciliation of the budgetary basis of accounting to the 4
modified accrual basis
Capital assets 2
Other (significant accounting policies, cash) 2
Noncompliance with State Law
Financial statements of 15 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law.
Financial statements of 15 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not fully collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by State
law (Exhibit A). Article 95, Section 22 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
9

--- Page 12 ---
requires that deposits with financial institutions by local governmental units be
fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes the risk of loss of deposits in
the event the financial institution defaults.
One local government invested in common stock which is a violation of State
law.
The financial statements of the Town of Lonaconing disclosed that the Town had
investments in common stock, totaling $49,974 as of June 30, 2006, which is a
violation of State law. Article 95, Section 22 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
restricts the types of investments authorized for local governments to those
specified in the State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 6-222 of the
Code. Investments not authorized by State law increase the Town’s risk of loss
associated with investments.
Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes:
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for five local
governments as of June 30, 2006.
Unreserved general fund deficit balances were noted for five local governments as
of June 30, 2006 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of the
current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem. Two of these local governments also had a general
fund deficit as of June 30, 2005.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local
governments as of June 30, 2006.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local governments as
of June 30, 2006 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local governments had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
10

--- Page 13 ---
balances to general fund expenditures. Significant unfavorable trends and ratios
have been noted for one of these local governments for each fiscal year since
2004.
The pension plan for one local government was significantly underfunded.
One local government had a pension plan that was significantly underfunded.
Specifically, members of the Fire and Police Departments of Baltimore City, who
were hired prior to January 1, 1947, were eligible for coverage under a defined
benefit retirement plan. All employees eligible under the plan have retired.
The City funds pension benefits under this plan on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.
During fiscal year 2006, the City contributed approximately $2.3 million to the
plan. The present value of future benefits related to this plan was approximately
$10.8 million as of June 30, 2006.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Code. Subsections (b) through (f) of this Section require that certain types of
special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the county in
which they are located within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year in accordance
with the rules and regulations established by the applicable county. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each district’s compliance with the
applicable provisions of the law and for submitting copies of these reports to the
Office of Legislative Audits.
The required reports have not been filed for four special taxing districts.
As of August 30, 2007, we had not received the required reports for four special
taxing districts located in Anne Arundel County for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2006. The County advised us that they were in the process of pursuing
compliance with applicable filing requirements for these districts and that
appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding County
funds).
