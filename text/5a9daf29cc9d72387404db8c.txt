Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA)
Original Hotline Allegation:
(cid:190) Possible conflict of interest for the procurement of .an
ambulance for BWI by MAA employees employed by the
ambulance dealer.
Key Findings:
(cid:190) MAA issued a $170,000 contract for an ambulance to a
vendor that employed two MAA employees.

been written to favor a particular vendor. For example,
(cid:190) Eight features from the MAA bid specifications were
virtually identical to the manufacturer’s description of
its ambulances.
(cid:190) We were advised by 2 vendors that they did not
submit a bid because only the selected vendor could
have fulfilled the contract specifications.
(cid:190) MAA provided certain inaccurate information to the Board
of Public works justifying the receipt of only one bid.
