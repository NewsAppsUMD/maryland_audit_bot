Audit Overview
(cid:190) UMB provides professional and graduate level
instruction through its schools of Dentistry, Law,
Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Social Work.
(cid:190) Certain UMB faculty members provide services to
the University of Maryland Medical System
Corporation, and the Corporation reimburses
UMB for the cost of services provided by the
faculty members.
(cid:190) For the spring 2009 semester, UMB’s enrollment
totaled approximately 6,100 students.
(cid:190) During FY 2009, UMB revenues totaled about
$909 million, including a General Fund
appropriation of $173 million.
(cid:190) The audit report included 13 findings, 7 of which
were repeated from the preceding audit report.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Several deficiencies were noted relating to certain
employee compensation, including:
(cid:131) Questionable employment compensation payments
totaling $410,000 to a senior management
employee.
(cid:131) A lack of established policies over the payment of
bonuses and other compensation (e.g., summer
research payments) made to employees.
(cid:190) UMB did not execute contracts and receive payments
timely from the University of Maryland Medical System
Corporation, and did not assess late payment fees of
$121,000.
(cid:190) Deficit balances of $2.9 million existed in certain
revolving fund accounts and UMB had not established
written plans to address the deficits.
(cid:190) Several purchasing/disbursement findings were noted:
(cid:131) BPW approval not obtained for certain contracts
(cid:131) Competitive procurement process not always used

Employee Compensation
UMB made questionable compensation payments
to a senior management employee and the
payments were not disclosed to the budget
committees. (Finding 1)
(cid:190) A senior management employee received
payments totaling $350,000 during fiscal year
2007 for unused sabbatical leave, even though
UMB and USM policies do not provide for such
payments.
(cid:190) Payments totaling $60,000 were made to the
employee for summer research and these
payments were approved by the employee’s
subordinate.
(cid:190) A compensation agreement entered into with
this same employee in June 2008 had not been
approved by the Office of the Attorney General
and the USM Board of Regents, as required by
USM policy.

Employee Compensation (continued)
Certain compensation payments made to employees
(other than their regular salaries) were not supported
by established policies. (Finding 2)
We tested 36 such compensation payments made to
employees during FYs 07 to 09 totaling $877,000.
(cid:131) Seven payments totaling $52,500 were made to
faculty members of one school for summer
research; however, UMB had not established a
policy governing such payments. Total payments
made to faculty for summer research during CYs
07 - 08 were $1.1 million.
(cid:131) Six payments totaling $160,000 represented
bonuses paid to employees even though UMB had
not established a policy for the payment of
bonuses. UMB lacked sufficient documentation
supporting how these payments were determined.
(cid:131) None of the aforementioned employee
compensation payments were specifically
disclosed in UMB’s annual budget submissions.

Contracts With Medical Systems
Annual contracts with the University of Maryland
Medical System Corporation were not executed
timely and payments from the Corporation and a
local hospital were not received timely. (Finding 5)
(cid:190) Contracts with the Corporation providing for the
reimbursement of certain costs incurred by UMB
during FYs 07–09 were executed as much as
23 months after the date required by State law.
(cid:190) Eighteen payments received from the
Corporation and a local hospital during FYs 06-
09 totaling $8.6 million were received from 14
to 165 days after the required payment date.
UMB did not assess related late payment fees
totaling $121,000.
(cid:190) Similar findings have been commented upon in
our preceding seven audit reports dating back
to 1988.

Revolving Fund Accounts
UMB did not always establish written plans to
eliminate deficit balances in revolving fund accounts.
As of 3/31/09, UMB had 172 such accounts with
deficit balances totaling $14.7 million. (Finding 6)
(cid:190) Our review of ten revolving fund accounts with
deficit balances totaling $5.4 million as of March
2009 disclosed that written plans to address the
deficit balances had not been established for six
accounts with deficits totaling $2.9 million. These
deficits had existed since at least 7/07. The six
accounts related to physician associations that
allow UMB faculty to engage in private practices
within UMB or at affiliated hospitals.
(cid:190) One of these physicians associations with a deficit
balance of $584,000 had experienced recurring
financial losses and it was unclear whether the
association would be able to make payments to
UMB to cover its deficit.

Purchasing and Disbursements
(cid:190) UMB did not always request BPW approval for
service contracts in excess of $500,000, as
required. An OLA test of 9 contracts totaling $7.9
million disclosed BPW approval was not obtained for
2 contracts valued at $1.8 million. (Finding 7)
(cid:190) UMB did not use a competitive procurement process
for repetitive purchases that were reasonably
expected to exceed $100,000, as required. An OLA
test of corporate purchasing card (CPC) purchases
totaling $5.1 million from 10 vendors during 7/06
through 10/08, found purchases totaling $1.2
million from 4 vendors were made without a
competitive procurement process. (Finding 8)
(cid:190) CPC transactions were not always properly reviewed
and approved for a former employee who pled guilty
in February 2009 to felony theft of $470,000 from
UMB. Additionally, documentation was not
maintained as to the disposition of $40,700 in gift
cards purchased by another employee. (Finding 9)

Other Findings
(cid:190) UMB did not adequately pursue the collection of
outstanding accounts receivables. For example,
an OLA test of 74 grant billings (primarily for
sponsored research) totaling $17.6 million made
during the period of 1/06 to 2/09, found that 58
of the billings totaling $11.4 million were not paid
timely or remained unpaid. Funds that would
otherwise be available for investment purposes
had to be used to fund the research until
payments were received. (Finding 4)
(cid:190) Several instances of inadequate IT controls were
noted, including:
(cid:131) Proper user account and password controls for
certain critical components were not
established. (Finding 10)
(cid:131) Certain significant security-related events for
financial and student-related information
systems were not monitored. (Finding 11)
(cid:131) Network security was inadequate to protect
certain key administrative systems. (Finding 12)

Conclusions
(cid:190) UMB should establish policies for additional
employee compensation payments and ensure
compliance with those policies. Additional
compensation payments should be specifically
disclosed in its annual budget submissions to
the General Assembly.
(cid:190) Contracts with medical systems should be
executed timely and UMB should assess late
payment fees for any payments that are not
received by the required payment date.
(cid:190) Written plans should be established to address
revolving fund accounts with deficit balances.
(cid:190) Adequate processes and controls should be
established over:
(cid:131) Procurement and disbursements (including
those made with a CPC),
(cid:131) Accounts receivable, and
(cid:131) Key information systems.
