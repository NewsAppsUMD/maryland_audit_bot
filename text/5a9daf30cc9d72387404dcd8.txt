Senator Guy J. Guzzone, Co-Chair, Joint Audit Committee
Delegate C. William Frick, Co-Chair, Joint Audit Committee
Members ofthe Joint Audit Committee
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) is seeking the Joint Audit Committee’s (JAC)
approval to amend the overall scope ofthe financial management practices performance audits of
local school systems. In addition, we are proposing to tailorthe scope ofeach local school system
audit to address each system’s particular financial management risks. Changing the overall audit
scope, coupled with tailoring the audit scope for each local school system, would reduce the audit
effort by concentrating our work on the most important financial management matters.
The State law (Education Fiscal Accountability and Oversight Act of2004) that authorized
OLA to conduct a financial management practices performance audit ofeach local school system
once every six years required OLA to obtain JAC’s approval of the audit scope prior to
commencing the audits. At its September 14, 2004 meeting, JAC approved OLA’s proposed
scope, consisting of 12 general audit areas, collectively including 34 objectives. Since OLA had
no prior experience auditing school systems, the scope was developed based on research and
discussions with other state auditors performing similar audits.
OLA believes that a change in the overall audit focus is warranted. OLA has gained
experience and knowledge ofMaryland’s school system operations over the last 12 years, during
which OLA has generally completed two six-year audit cycles. Based on that work, we believe
focusing onthe most critical financial management areas would result in amore efficient audit and
reduced workload for school system personnel, while still providing the General Assembly and
local officials with an objective and meaningful assessment of each system’s major financial
operations. Furthermore, the enactment of recent legislation (Chapter 261, Laws of Maryland,
2016), which provides an exemption from the next six-year audit cycle for individual school
systems if certain requirements are met, suggests to OLA that a more targeted approach is
desirable.

Delegate C. William Frick, Co-Chair
Members ofthe Joint Audit Committee
OLA is proposing that the overall audit scope be revised to eliminate 16 of 34 audit
objectives (see Proposed Audit Scope Outline and Proposed Audit Scope Deletions) that were
previously approved by the JAC. Furthermore, unlike the past two audit cycles, we may not
perform workin each ofthe 12 general audit areas based on our assessment ofthe primary financial
management risks for each local school system. Previously, for every school system, we have
performed audit work in each ofthe general audit areas, although the extent ofsuch work varied.
Thank you for your consideration ofour proposal.
Sincerely,
Thomas J. Barnickel III
Legislative Auditor
