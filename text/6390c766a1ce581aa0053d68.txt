Reports Recommended for Committee Action
November 1, 2022 to November 30, 2022
The following audit report has been recommended for follow-up action by the Joint Audit
and Evaluation Committee (JAEC). The basis of the recommendation could include the
number and significance of the audit findings, the agency receiving an “unsatisfactory”
rating (which will necessitate future OLA follow-up), and/or contentious or controversial
issues that remain unresolved or have related recommendations in a state of
implementation (that is, are “in–progress” by the agency). The determination of whether
to recommend a JAEC follow-up letter (letter of concern) or hearing, is based on a
subjective determination by the OLA using professional judgment. The purpose of a
“follow-up letter” from the Committee is to convey the Legislature’s formal concern and
reinforce the Committee’s commitment to ensure appropriate accountability is
established (via the audit recommendations) for those audits or findings that do not rise
to the level of a hearing.
1) Maryland Department of Labor – Division of Unemployment Insurance (DUI) –
Part 2 – Unemployment Benefits (11/15/22 – 13 findings, DUI’s accountability
and compliance level was unsatisfactory due to the significance and number of
findings across all areas of DUI’s operations)2
