Key Audit Issues (from original audit report)
Presentation of original audit report to the JAC was
made on September 9, 2008.
1. Use of helicopters for non-critical missions was
not deemed to be significant.
2. Better information systems are needed to
provide data needed to manage critical aspects
of its operations, including the identification of:
(cid:131) downtime by helicopter, and
(cid:131) all costs associated with maintenance to
help assess efficiency, appropriate staffing
levels and the cost/benefits of outsourcing.
3. Certain personnel policies and practices should
be addressed to foster more stable leadership,
reduce staff turnover and establish competitive
salaries.
4. A key performance measure needs to be better
defined and subject to quality assurance
processes to ensure the reliability of results.

Report Recommendations & DSP Responses
(cid:190) Our report included 22 specific recommendations.
(cid:190) DSP’s response indicated general agreement with
all but one of the recommendations and included a
timeline of the planned corrective (including
anticipated completion dates). Completion dates
were primarily either February 2009 or July 2009.
(cid:190) Area of Disagreement- Recommendation 21 “that
the Command develop formal qualifications for its
various management/ supervisory positions.”
(cid:131) Subsequent to the issuance of the audit report
and the September 2008 JAC hearing, OLA and
DSP have been unable to reach agreement
regarding establishing qualifications for certain
management positions.
(cid:131) DSP believes this recommendation would unduly
limit the Superintendent’s legal authority
(provided for in State law) to organize, and assign
personnel within, the Department.
