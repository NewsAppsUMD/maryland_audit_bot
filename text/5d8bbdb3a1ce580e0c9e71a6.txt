AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Improve Financial Recording
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: No
During our audit of fiscal year 2017, we noted that the Potomac River Fisheries Commission
(Commission) did not have accounting personnel with adequate knowledge of accounting standards to
properly record and process the Commission’s uncommon financial transactions. While we considered
this issue resolved in our fiscal year 2018 audit, the issue has surfaced again, resulting in various
inaccuracies, as described below, in the Commissions financial records. The Fiscal Officer did not
properly prepare the year-end adjusting entries to record:
 An expense for the annual contribution to the retiree healthcare investment account,
resulting in an understatement of expenses of $20,000; and
 An adjustment of the liability for future oyster work after the Commission reduced
some of the oyster program restrictions from prior years totaling $185,282.
In addition, the Fiscal Officer post-dated the check for the Commission’s annual insurance
premium for July 1, 2019; however, the check cleared the bank on June 28, 2019. This resulted in a
variance between the reconciled balance in the operating account and the general ledger balance. The
Fiscal Officer did not detect the variance because she does not perform a review of account activity.
Overstatement of liabilities and expenses hinders the ability of the Commission to assess its
financial position and make sound financial decisions. While the Fiscal Officer has taken training on the
accounting system and the Executive Secretary has taken an introductory online class in accounting, they
still require additional knowledge and training in some areas. The Commission should continue to
encourage the Fiscal Officer to enhance her knowledge. In addition, the Fiscal Officer should review all
financial transactions and account balances for agreement and completeness at a minimum each
quarter, and especially at year end, prior to presenting the financial report to the full Commission.
Prepare Bank Reconciliations Timely
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (first issued in fiscal year 2016)
The Commission does not prepare bank reconciliations timely. The Commission holds six
checking/savings accounts, which requires them to complete 72 reconciliations. The Executive Secretary
prepared reconciliations 32 to 61 days after month end for 15 reconciliations or 21 percent. The
Commission policy manual, which was last updated on June 7, 2019, does not outline a timeframe for
the completion of the reconciliations. Best practices suggest that the Commission should complete a
reconciliation at least monthly prior to issuance of the following month’s statement to ensure that
transactions are correct and no fraud has occurred.

--- Page 8 ---
Without timely reconciliation of all bank accounts, the Commission increases the risk that
unauthorized expenses will occur and that deposits will not be properly recorded. Preparation
timeliness has improved since the prior year; however, we still recommend that the Executive Secretary
should set specific deadlines for completion of all monthly bank reconciliations and adhere to these
deadlines.
Develop and Implement Information Security Policies and Procedures
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: No
The Commission does not have information security policies and procedures to support their
information security program. In addition, the Commission has not adopted an information security
standard. Industry best practices suggest that entities prepare, disseminate, and maintain information
security policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures to facilitate effective implementation of an
information security program.
Without documented and formally approved information security policies and procedures, the
Commission cannot effectively communicate and implement information security requirements to
protect and mitigate risks to sensitive data. Additionally, the Commission may inconsistently address
security needs in the information technology (IT) environment, increasing the potential of unauthorized
access to data and reducing the ability to recover from system outages timely, among other risks.
The Commission has not adopted an information security standard and lacks documented and
approved information security policies and procedures due to a lack of sufficient financial resources to
hire full-time IT personnel. Additionally, the Commission uses outside contractors to help manage and
maintain its IT operations, and the contractors may not understand the Commonwealth security
requirements. Given the absence of the Commission’s choice of an information security standard, we
evaluated their information security program against the Commonwealth’s Information Security
Standard, SEC 501.
The Commission should dedicate the necessary resources to select a security standard, develop
and formally approve information security policies and procedures, and implement them into their
information security program. The policies should align with the requirements in the security standard
the Commission selects and establish the minimum information security requirements to implement in
the Commission’s IT environment. Selecting an information security standard and developing and
implementing information security policies and procedures will help to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of data and achieve compliance with the security standard.

Upgrade End-of-Life Technology
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: No
The Commission is using end-of-life software to support their sensitive systems. The Commission
is running unsupported software versions to support their backup environment. In addition, the
operating system that supports the Commissions’ production environment and all desktop devices are
running software for which support will end in January 2020. There are currently no plans to upgrade
or replace the end-of-life server and other software versions that will be end-of-life in several months.
We communicated these issues to management in a separate document marked Freedom of
Information Act Exempt (FOIAE) under § 2.2-3705.2 of the Code of Virginia due to it containing
descriptions of security mechanisms.
The Commonwealth’s Information Security Standard, SEC 501 (Security Standard), Section SI-2-
COV, prohibits the use of software products that the software publisher has designated as end-of-life or
end-of-support. Additionally, the Security Standard, Section SI-2, requires entities to install security-
relevant software and firmware updates within 90-days after the vendor releases the update.
The Commission’s use of end-of-life software increases the risk that known vulnerabilities will
persist in the systems without the potential for patching or mitigation. Additionally, vendors do not offer
operational and technical support for software versions designated as end-of-life or end-of-support,
which increases the difficulty of restoring system functionality if a technical failure occurs. The
Commissions production and backup environments use the end-of-life technology, which increases the
risk of an extended downtime in the event of an outage.
While management is aware of the need for current technology, the Commission lacked the
financial resources to upgrade their information technology infrastructure to versions the vendor
supports due to a going concern issued identified in fiscal year 2016.
The Commission should dedicate the resources necessary to upgrade the infrastructure
components using the end-of-life technology as soon as possible. Upgrading and replacing the end-of-
life technology will help to protect the integrity and availability of mission essential data.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the
following sources.
Commission Revenues
Table 1
2018 2019
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000
Federal and other grants 104,350 67,728
Sport fishing licenses 113,459 102,505
Commercial fishing licenses 79,215 82,618
Commercial crab licenses 67,975 70,690
Commercial oyster and clam licenses 80,085 92,873
Commercial license surcharge 60,450 120,250
Oyster bushel tax 13,681 23,815
Interest and miscellaneous 28,765 53,708
Total revenue $836,730 $902,937
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission’s revenues increased by eight percent for fiscal year 2019 due primarily to an
increase in the fees charged for commercial license registration (from $50 to $150). All other license
revenues increased except for sport fishing licenses due to a severe decrease in the striped bass
population and more stringent sport regulations. Additionally, federal grant revenues decreased as
there were no oyster plantings during the fiscal year due to conditions in the Potomac River caused by
record rainfalls, which decreased the salinity of the water.

The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years:
Commission Expenses
Table 2
2018 2019
Personnel services $405,401 $377,974
Development and repletion 124,563 22,500
Federal grant 102,373 53,268
Contractual services 83,140 72,039
Materials and supplies 54,975 52,908
Insurance 8,033 8,175
Fixed assets - 3,368
Total Operating Expenses 778,485 590,232
Reserve Fund Deposits for:
Retiree health care 20,000 20,000
Total Expenses $798,485 $610,232
Source: Commission’s financial system
Total expenses decreased by 24 percent from fiscal year 2018. This is attributable to continued
decrease in oyster seeding expenses due to weather conditions (82 percent) and a seven percent
reduction in personnel expenses. In addition, the Commission made a conscious effort to decrease
operating expenses to address the going concern issue reported in previous reports.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2019 with an operating profit of $292,706, including funding
of the retiree healthcare trust. This profit is attributable to no oyster plantings for the oyster programs
and an increase in the commercial license registration fee. The Commission has also changed their
strategy and overhauled the oyster program reserves to reduce the reserve by approximately $185,000.
The Commission has taken seriously the going concern issue reported in the last three fiscal years
and has become more deliberate in their financial planning. The Commission ended the year with a
positive operating cash balance of $266,164 as shown in Chart 1. By repurposing the oyster program
reserve funds, they have reduced prior year deficits in funding reserves to $18,381. The Commission
voted in October 2018 to only fund amounts specifically received for the Oyster Management Reserve
(Reserve) and Rotational Natural Oyster Harvest Program (Harvest) supplemented by amounts
specifically allowed by the Potomac River Compact of 1958. The Commission has improved their overall
financial position through these actions.

Fiscal Year
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission closed fiscal year 2019 with an overall cash balance of $941,957 in six different
bank accounts, which was a 50 percent increase ($311,403) over fiscal year 2018 levels. The cash balance
includes $221,934 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts to fund future oyster work and
$453,859 in a separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree health care reserves. The remaining
three accounts include two operating and one savings account. The retiree healthcare account is
managed by a trust and legally cannot be used to fund operations. The Commission earmarked two
accounts for the Reserve and Harvest programs, and the Commission no longer uses these reserves to
supplement operating cash. As shown in Chart 2, as of June 30, 2019, the Commission’s operating cash
coverage has tripled from negative two months coverage to a positive 5 months coverage of operating
expenses due to the Commission’s decision to restrict contributions to the oyster programs and
recalculate the reserves for these programs.

The Honorable Ralph S. Northam
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Thomas K. Norment, Jr.
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2019. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commission’s financial system; review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls; test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and review corrective
actions of audit findings from the prior year report.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances.

Information system security
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also tested details of
transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system, excepted as reported in the finding “Improve
Financial Recording.” The financial information presented in this report came directly from the
Commission’s financial system.
We noted certain matters involving internal control and its operation that require management’s
attention and corrective action. These matters are described in the section entitled “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.” The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts,
and grant agreements disclosed no instances of non-compliance or other matters that are required to
be reported under Government Auditing Standards.
The Commission has taken adequate corrective action with respect to audit findings reported in
the prior year that are not repeated in this letter.
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on September 11, 2019. Management’s response to
the findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did not
audit management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
