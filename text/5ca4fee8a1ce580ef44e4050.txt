Dear Senator King and Delegate McIntosh:
The Office ofLegislative Audits (OLA) has reviewed the actions taken by the Department
ofHuman Services (DHS) Office ofthe Secretary to resolve the repeat findings in our September
12, 2017 audit report. This review was conducted in accordance with a requirement specified in
the April 201$ Joint Chairmen’s Report (ICR), page 101. The ICR required that, prior to the
release of $100,000 of its administrative appropriation for fiscal year 2019, DHS must take
corrective action on all repeat audit findings on or before November 1, 2018. The JCR language
further provided that OLA submit a report to the budget committees listing each repeat audit
finding along with a determination that each finding was corrected. The OLA report is required
to be submitted to allow 45 days for the budget committees to review and release the funds prior
to the end ofthe fiscal year.
The September 12, 2017 audit report ofDHS contained four repeat audit findings (findings
4, 5, 10, and 12) that were addressedby four recommendations. In accordance withthe April 201$
requirement, DHS provided a report to OLA, dated November 1, 2018, detailing the corrective
actionsthat it hadtaken withrespectto the repeat audit findings (Exhibit 1). The DHS status report
indicated that corrective action had been completed to address all ofthe recommendations.

Delegate Maggie McIntosh, Chair
We reviewedthe DHS status report and related documentation, performed limitedtests and
analyses of the information, and held discussion with DHS personnel as necessary to assess the
implementation status of the related recommendations. In this regard, findings 4 and 5 were
previously determined to be resolved during our March 2018 review undertaken in response to the
April 2017 JCR, the results of which were communicated in the letter from us dated March 6,
201$. As such, our current review was limited to determining the status ofrepeat findings 10 and
12. Our review did not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. Based on our current review, we determined that DHS had
resolved findings 10 and 12 (Exhibit 2).
After discussing our review results, DHS generally agreed with the accuracy of the
information presented. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation extended to us by DHS during
this review and its willingness to address the audit issues and implement appropriate corrective
actions.
We trust our response satisfactorily addresses the JCR requirement. Please contact me if
you need additional information.
Sincerely,
Gregory A. Hook, CPA
