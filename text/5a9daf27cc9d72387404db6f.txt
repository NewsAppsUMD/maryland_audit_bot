Audit Overview
(cid:190) DDA plans, develops policies and regulations, and
funds a statewide system of services for individuals
with developmental disabilities and their families.
(cid:190) Through private contractors, DDA funds services to
the developmentally disabled, various community-
based programs that include community residential
services, day habilitation services, and vocational
training.
(cid:190) In FY 2009, DDA served over 24,000 individuals
with developmental disabilities and it’s
expenditures totaled $718 million ($416 million
general funds, $297 million federal funds, $5
million in special and reimbursable funds).
(cid:190) The report included 14 findings, 4 of which were
repeated from the preceding audit report. These
four repeated findings appear as five findings in
this report.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Maximization of Federal Funds.
(cid:131) Opportunity was lost to obtain $3 million in federal
funds due to the failure to submit rejected claims
identified during the prior audit.
(cid:131) Unrecovered funds of $570,000 due to failure to
detect or investigate certain rejected claims.
(cid:131) Lost interest of $421,000 due to untimely requests.
(cid:190) Certain reports to the Legislature contained
undocumented critical information or were not
comprehensive.
(cid:190) Inadequate monitoring of contractors/providers
resulted in certain clients losing Medicaid eligibility
(resulting in the State paying all service costs) and in
payments for services provided after certain clients’
dates of death.
(cid:190) An OLA Performance Audit Report - Processing of
Certain Medicaid Claims (dated 11/09) - noted there
was no systematic process to analyze the causes of
rejected DDA federal reimbursement claims.

Federal Funds
(cid:190) DDA lost the opportunity to obtain federal funds
totaling approximately $3 million, because claims
were not corrected and resubmitted within
required federal timeframes. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) Our preceding audit identified $3.3 million in
available federal funding due to DDA under-
billing the federal government during CYs 2004
and 2005.
(cid:131) Our current audit found that DDA only
resubmitted corrected claims for federal funding
totaling $323,000, out of the $3.3 million
identified.

Federal Funds
(cont’d)
(cid:190) DDA did not investigate rejected federal fund
reimbursement claims and federal funds were
not recovered because of improper edits.
(Finding 2)
(cid:131) DDA did not investigate the cause of claims
rejected for eligibility reasons (e.g., a client not
eligible on the date of service). During
December 2008, such rejected claims totaled
$1.5 million. DDA did not maintain records of
rejected claims and their related disposition.
(cid:131) Federal funds totaling $433,000 were not
recovered due to the improper application of a
DHMH Medicaid edit to DDA claims.

Federal Funds
(cont’d)
DDA did not have adequate processes to ensure that
certain provider claims were submitted for Federal
reimbursement processing and that reimbursement
requests were timely. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) Our test of manual claims totaling $1.2 million,
which DDA’s records indicated had been
submitted for reimbursement processing, found
that claims for 70 clients totaling $279,000 were
not actually processed for Federal reimbursement.
Consequently, the related federal funding
($139,500) was not obtained.
(cid:131) Federal fund reimbursement requests were not
always timely. Our test of 21 federal fund
reimbursement requests from July 2007 to
February 2009, revealed that 5 requests were
submitted from 3 to 4 months late, resulting in
$421,000 of lost income to the State.

Reports to the General Assembly
Certain reports to the General Assembly contained
undocumented critical information or were not
comprehensive.
(cid:131) DDA lacked documentation supporting the annual
waiting list information reported to the General
Assembly’s budget committees in 1/09, potentially
impacting its accuracy. For example, DDA could not
provide detail for the reported 17,250 individuals
waiting for one or more services, and as of 6/09 had
not completed a review begun in 12/08, that
identified 250 deceased individuals who should
have been removed from the list. (Finding 4)
(cid:131) A DDA report, in response to the 2008 JCR
requesting details on the prioritization of services,
omitted certain information on the Transitioning
Youth Program. The report did not disclose that
clients completing that one-year Program bypassed
all other individuals on the waiting list for full
services (individuals on the list are prioritized based
on severity of need and some have been on the list
for over 20 years). (Finding 5)

Client Resource Coordinators (CRCs)
DDA did not ensure that CRCs performed required
annual eligibility assessments for certain clients,
resulting in lost federal Medicaid eligibility. (Finding 6)
(cid:131) An OLA test of a DDA report of clients, who lost their
Medicaid eligibility during the period from July 2006
to November 2008, found 72 clients who lost
eligibility because the CRCs did not perform the
required reassessment. These clients were
subsequently funded solely with State funds.
(cid:131) DDA was unaware of the lost eligibility, since no
documented follow-up actions were taken by DDA to
ensure that client eligibility was reassessed.
(cid:131) DDA also did not monitor the CRCs to ensure that
they met with clients every six months, as required
by State regulations. Had DDA ensured that such
meetings occurred, it would have been alerted to
certain improper provider billings and payments (as
noted in Finding 7).

Payments for Deceased Individuals
DDA did not have effective procedures to detect
providers who billed for services to deceased
individuals. (Finding 7)
(cid:131) We matched DDA’s FY 2007 and 2008 payment
files to death records maintained by DHMH’s
Division of Vital Records and identified 367 clients
who received payments during those years, but died
before 7/1/08.
(cid:131) Our test of payments to 43 clients found many did
not receive payment for service after death, but:
• DDA did pay 7 providers $235,000 for 8 clients
who were deceased on the dates services were
reportedly provided.
• For example, one provider reported providing
services for a client through FY 2008; however,
that client died in 2003 and the provider was paid
$70,339 during that 5-year period.
(cid:131) We referred this matter to the Office of the Attorney
General – Criminal Division.

Other Issues
(cid:190) DDA did not have adequate procedures to verify
that clients in the Family and Support Services and
the Individual Family Care programs received
required services. Payments for these programs
during FY 2009 totaled $41 million, primarily from
general funds. (Finding 8)
(cid:190) DDA did not take timely action to recover $3.6
million from providers for Wage Disparity Funds
paid to providers that were not used to increase
compensation for providers’ direct service workers,
as required by State law. As of June 2009, $2.9
million remained uncollected. (Finding 10)
(cid:190) Proper security had not been established to control
access to DDA’s provider customer information
system (PCIS2) as well as to restrict the
capabilities of users. (Findings 11 – 12)

DDA Related OLA Performance Audit Findings
In November 2009, OLA issued a performance audit
report which evaluated the effectiveness of the
DHMH’s processes to obtain federal Medicaid funds
for other administrations including DDA.
(cid:190) No systematic process existed to analyze the
reasons for numerous DDA claims for federal
reimbursement being rejected by the claims
processing system. For example, 116,000 DDA
claims submitted during August 2008 totaling
$12.2 million were rejected. Since DDA previously
paid providers for the services and determined the
related costs represented legitimate claims for
federal funding, the amount of rejected claims
should be minimal.
(cid:190) Rejected claims for federal reimbursement were
not investigated and resolved promptly. As of
December 2008, DDA claims paid for services
provided in CY 2006 totaling approximately $8.4
million were submitted and denied for federal
reimbursement and remained outstanding.

Conclusion
DDA needs to:
(cid:190)maximize the recovery of federal funds, submit
reimbursement requests timely, promptly
investigate and resubmit rejected claims, and
ensure that reassessments of client Medicaid
eligibility are conducted, as appropriate.
(cid:190)maintain documentation to support information
reported to the General Assembly and ensure the
accuracy of the reported information.
(cid:190)monitor the work of contractors and the services
performed by providers for compliance with
related legal requirements.
(cid:190)collect amounts due from providers and establish
proper controls over its automated provider
consumer information system (PCIS2).
(cid:190)With DHMH, determine what improvements can
be made to reduce claim rejections.
