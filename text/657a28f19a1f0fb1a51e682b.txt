Overview of Repeat Audit Findings
 OLA issues about 50 fiscal compliance audit reports each year containing
about 150 recommendations.
 Virtually all recommendations are accepted by agencies, although there have
been isolated disagreements.
 As of June 2008, 35% of findings were repeated in the first subsequent audit
report.
 As of June 2023, 27% of findings were repeated in the first subsequent audit
report, indicating significant improvement since 2008. After a decline in
2013 to 21%, the overall repeat percentage started rising again up to 29% in
June 2021. The number of repeat findings has been stable for the last two
years (See Exhibit).
 As of June 2023, 8% of findings were repeated after the second subsequent
audit, which represents no change from the previous year.

Follow-up Processes for Repeat Audit Findings
 State Government Article, §2-1224(h) requires agencies with 5 or more
repeat audit findings to provide
• an initial status report to OLA on corrective actions taken on all findings
within 9 months of the related audit reports and, thereafter,
• quarterly status reports until satisfactory progress has been made on all
findings, or until the next audit begins.
 Budget bill language and committee narrative (Joint Chairmen’s Report),
instituted annually since the 2013 Session, has restricted the appropriations
for agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings until
• corrective action has been taken by the agencies for the repeat findings,
and
• OLA submits reports on its determination regarding the actions taken.

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process
Historical Perspective:
 From 2006 to October 2010, 38 audit reports (involving 28 agencies) had 5
or more repeat findings, requiring these agencies to submit quarterly status
reports, which are subject to OLA desk review.
 From October 2010 through December 2016, 4 audit reports had 5 or more
repeat findings and the status report process has concluded. These 4 audit
reports collectively contained 44 report findings (including 23 repeats). The
next audit for each found that 35 of the 44 prior findings were resolved (only
1 of the original 23 repeats was not corrected).
 During calendar years 2017 and 2018, 4 audit reports had 5 or more repeat
findings and have also been subject to the more comprehensive JCR follow-
up process and/or the OLA follow-up review process for agencies with
unsatisfactory ratings. These 4 audit reports collectively contained 50 report
findings (including 26 repeats). The next audit for each found that 37 of the
50 prior findings were resolved (only 4 of the original 26 repeats were not
corrected).

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process (cont.)
 During calendar year 2019, 2 audit reports had 5 or more repeat findings and
have also been subject to the OLA follow-up review process for agencies with
unsatisfactory ratings or the more comprehensive JCR follow-up process.
These 2 audit reports collectively contained 17 report findings (including 10
repeats). The next audit for each found that 9 of the 17 prior findings were
resolved (6 of the original 10 repeats were not corrected).
 During calendar year 2020, no audit reports issued had 5 or more repeat
findings.
 During calendar year 2021, 3 audit reports had 5 or more repeat findings and
have been subject to the OLA follow-up review process for agencies with
unsatisfactory ratings and/or the more comprehensive JCR follow-up process.
All 3 reports are subject to the quarterly status report process, which is still in
process for 1 agency. Subsequent audits are in progress or due to start for
the other 2 agencies.

Results for the SG §2-1224(h) Follow-up Process (cont.)
 During calendar year 2022, 3 audit reports including DHS – Local
Department Operations (LDO) and DHS – Family Investment Administration
(FIA) had 5 or more repeat findings. The third report is not named in this
presentation due to the existence of cybersecurity-related issues in the
repeat finding total. The JCR requires OLA review of agency corrective action
for 2 of these reports, while the JCR subjects the LDO to follow-up and
reporting by DHS – Office of the Secretary. The OLA quarterly status report
process is also ongoing for all 3 audits.

JCR Follow-up Process – Background
 Beginning with the April 2013 Joint Chairmen’s Report, in response to JAC
concerns, the Chairmen of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and
the House Appropriations Committee instituted a process to restrict funding
for agencies with 4 or more repeat audit findings, until the submission of a
report by OLA on the status of related corrective actions.
 The annual amount of funds restricted for each agency generally is
$100,000, but has recently ranged as high as $500,000.
 The determination of whether to release funding is at the sole discretion of
the budget committees.

JCR Follow-up Process – Recent Results
 The April 2022 JCR contained budget bill language restrictions for 3 agencies
with 4 or more repeat audit findings or significant findings. Based on OLA’s
review, the 3 agencies had not fully resolved the findings, with over half of the
collective 15 findings still in progress. The budget committees did not release
the restricted funds for these agencies.
 The April 2023 JCR contained budget bill language restrictions for 4 agencies
with 4 or more repeat audit findings, including those referred to on page 6,
plus MDH – DDA and MDL – DUI. In November 2023, OLA sent out letters to
these agencies reminding them of the need to submit the required reports.
OLA will review these reports and will report our conclusions regarding the
corrective actions taken on the 18 repeat findings to the budget committees.
The budget committees have 45 days from receipt of the report to review and
comment to allow for funds to be released prior to the end of fiscal year 2024.
 In addition to the above, there were budget language restrictions in April 2020,
2021, and 2023 for cybersecurity-related findings.

Conclusion
 We believe that the various follow-up processes provide useful tools to
compel State agencies to generally take meaningful corrective action to
implement audit recommendations.
 Since 2008, the overall percentage of repeat audit findings has decreased
from 35% to 27% in 2023. There were some recent upticks in repeat
percentages, but those percentages have begun to trend down again starting
in 2022. OLA will continue to monitor this trend and report to the Committee.
