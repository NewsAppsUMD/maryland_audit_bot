Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have conducted a follow-up review of actions taken by the Maryland
Department of Health (MDH) to address the findings in our October 19, 2023
audit report of the MDH – Office of the Secretary and Other Units. In that report,
we concluded that MDH’s accountability and compliance rating was
unsatisfactory.
In March 2024, we requested an implementation status from MDH for the
findings included in the report. In response to our request, MDH provided a
status report, as of April 18, 2024, which indicated that MDH had made minimal
progress in addressing the findings. Accordingly, we determined that we would
delay our follow up review and request an updated status report from MDH in
August 2024.
MDH provided a status report, as of September 30, 2024, indicating the
implementation status of each of the 17 findings as well as its corrective action
plan, including timelines and processes to monitor the implementation of the plan.
In summary, MDH’s status report indicated that, for the 12 non-cybersecurity-
related findings, 5 findings had been corrected (all recommendations fully
implemented) and additional corrective actions were required to fully implement
some or all of the recommendations for the remaining 7 findings in our report.
Based on our assessment of the relative significance of the 17 findings, we
performed certain procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of actions taken by
MDH for 8 non-cybersecurity-related findings. Our review, which was performed
during the period from December 2024 to February 2025, disclosed that MDH
had corrected 2 of the 8 non-cybersecurity-related findings and had made
progress, but had not resolved some or all of the recommendations in the 6
remaining findings. For the 2 that had been corrected, this outcome was due to

--- Page 4 ---
MDH either meeting its established deadline for implementation of its corrective
action or implementing actions more timely than planned.
Exhibit 1 identifies MDH’s assessed implementation status for the 12 non-
cybersecurity-related findings, according to the status report, as well as the results
of our review for the 8 non-cybersecurity-related findings. Exhibit 2 describes, in
detail, the results of our review of the status of MDH’s efforts to implement the
recommendations for the 6 non-cybersecurity-related findings that we determined
MDH had not resolved (fully corrected). To obtain a thorough understanding of
the audit findings, recommendations, and the follow-up status described in
Exhibit 2, the original October 19, 2023 audit report should be consulted due to
the technical nature of some of these findings.
MDH’s status report and its response to this report are included as Appendix A
and Appendix B, respectively. Consistent with State law, we have redacted any
cybersecurity elements in these appendices. MDH’s response, as presented in
Appendix B, only addresses the recommendations that we determined to be in
progress. We have reviewed MDH’s response to our assessment of the status of
those recommendations and determined that MDH generally agreed with our
assessment.
To improve its accountability and compliance rating, MDH should continue to
implement its corrective action plan for all findings and related recommendations,
and ensure that other areas do not deteriorate. The status of all of the audit
findings will be subject to review during our next audit of the MDH – Office of
the Secretary and Other Units. We wish to acknowledge the cooperation
extended to us during the review by MDH.
Respectfully submitted,

Federal Funds
Prior Finding 2
The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) did not ensure critical
quarterly reconciliations were performed, resulting in the failure to recover
$973.3 million of federal funding timely and lost investment income totaling
$6.4 million.
Prior Report Recommendation 2
We recommend that MDH establish a formal policy and procedures, including the
appropriate procedural safeguards, to ensure that the critical quarterly
reconciliations are completed properly and timely, and reviewed and approved by
a supervisor independent of the reconciliation process.
Status as Determined by MDH – Corrected
Office of Legislative Audits (OLA) Assessment of Status – In Progress
MDH did not fully implement the recommendation. While MDH developed
written procedures for completing quarterly reconciliations of its federal fund
recoveries in March 2024, these procedures did not address the timing of when
the reconciliations were to be performed. Furthermore, as of December 2024,
MDH had not completed reconciliations for the quarters ending June and
September 2024.
MDH advised that the June and September 2024 reconciliations were not
performed because it prioritized the fiscal year 2024 closeout process. This
response raises questions about MDH’s commitment to ensuring the
reconciliations are completed in a timely manner going forward and emphasizes
the need for the procedures to include a specific timeframe for completing the
reconciliation.
MDH could not provide us with a timeline for when the overdue reconciliations
would be completed, nor could it readily determine the amount of federal funds it
had not collected due to its failure to perform the reconciliations or the amount of
the related lost investment income to the State. In this regard, our October 2023
audit report noted that the failure to perform quarterly reconciliations resulted in
6

--- Page 9 ---
the untimely recovery of federal funds totaling $973.3 million and lost investment
income totaling $6.4 million.
Prior Finding 3
MDH did not have procedures to ensure federal funds requested for
reimbursement of State payments were subsequently received.
Prior Report Recommendation 3
We recommend that MDH establish a documented procedure to ensure that all
federal funds requested were received.
Status as Determined by MDH – Corrected
OLA Assessment of Status – In Progress
MDH did not implement the recommendation. Although MDH advised us that it
implemented a review process in December 2024 to ensure drawdown requests
were received, MDH did not document these reviews. Accordingly, we could not
verify that the reviews were performed.
Budgetary and Year-End Closing
Prior Finding 5
MDH used an automated script to record year-end revenue entries without
verifying that the amounts recorded were valid and collectable.
Prior Report Recommendation 5
We recommend that MDH
a. ensure that all year-end revenue transactions are properly supported,
b. analyze the balances in the federal fund accounts to determine the
collectability of any deficit balances and proper disposition of any surplus
balances, and
c. properly report any amounts determined to be uncollectable and work with the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to resolve any related
deficits.
Status as Determined by MDH – In Progress
OLA Assessment of Status – In Progress
MDH did not implement the recommendations.

--- Page 10 ---
In response to recommendation a, MDH advised that it was developing a process
to ensure that the year-end balances in its federal fund accounts accurately
reflected amounts that were valid and collectable from the federal government,
but that this process would not be implemented until June 30, 2025. As noted in
our recently issued Statewide Review of Budget Closeout Transactions for Fiscal
Year 2024, MDH continued to record accrued federal fund revenue entries using
an automated script5 and still could not support the propriety of its accrued federal
fund revenue entries. Specifically, our test of 10 positive accrued revenue entries
totaling $2 billion disclosed that MDH could not readily document that 8 of the
entries totaling $1.7 billion accurately reflected amounts collectable from the
federal government.
In regard to recommendation b, MDH indicated that it contracted with an
independent accounting firm to analyze the balances in its federal accounts but
that this analysis would not be completed until June 30, 2025. Our review of
MDH’s fiscal year 2024 federal fund accrued revenue entries disclosed that a
significant number of these entries were recorded to accounts that had no current
year expenditures, including numerous entries that were identical to entries
recorded in one or more prior fiscal years dating as far back as June 30, 2015.6
In regard to recommendation c, MDH had not yet reported any uncollectible
amounts to DBM because, as noted above, the independent accounting firm was
still analyzing the balances in MDH’s federal fund accounts.
Procurements and Disbursements
Prior Finding 6
MDH used an emergency contract originally procured for COVID related
purposes for unrelated services without sufficient documentation that the
services were received and the related payments were proper. As a result, we
could not determine services were received or the propriety of MDH
payments totaling $60.4 million.
Prior Report Recommendation 6
We recommend that MDH
5 The automated script recorded year-end revenue entries to offset positive and negative account
balances at year-end, resulting in the accounts being zeroed out at year-end.
6 Specifically, 265 of the 994 fiscal year 2024 accrued revenue entries were recorded to accounts
with no fiscal year 2024 expenditures, including 121 entries that were identical to entries
recorded in one or more fiscal years.

a. conduct a review of this contract, which includes obtaining the detailed
staffing information required by the contract, determine the extent of the
services that were provided in relation to payments made, recover any
payments determined to be improper, and disclose this information to the
Board of Public Works (BPW); and
b. ensure that future emergency contracts are procured and documented in
accordance with State procurement regulations and are properly monitored to
ensure services were received and the related billings are adequately
supported.
Status as Determined by MDH – Corrected
OLA Assessment of Status – In Progress
MDH did not fully implement the recommendations.
In regard to recommendation a, MDH’s response indicated that it initiated a
review in September 2023 to determine the services received and the propriety of
the related payments made under the emergency contract. MDH’s review
identified certain overpayments resulting from the vendor improperly billing
above the contract rates for certain individuals. Our review disclosed that MDH’s
conclusions appeared to be proper based on the supporting documentation. MDH
advised that it was working with legal counsel to pursue recovery of these funds.
However, as of February 2025 no funds have been recovered from the vendor.
In regard to recommendation b, our review of the one emergency contract MDH
awarded since our audit disclosed that it was not procured in accordance with
State procurement regulations. On December 15, 2023, MDH awarded a
$554,000 emergency contract to address a heating system failure at Clifton T.
Perkins Hospital Center. Four days later it processed a $5.1 million contract
modification to install a temporary boiler and extend the term until September 30,
2024. MDH could not document that it negotiated the terms of the initial contract
and could not justify the $5.1 million modification made four days after the initial
contract.
As of January 2025, MDH had processed a total of six modifications that
collectively increased the cost of this contract by $20.7 million, including a $12.9
million modification processed 10 months after the initial procurement to extend
the contract term through March 2026 (see Figure 1 on the following page).
MDH could not justify why it did not competitively procure a contract during the
year since the initial emergency contract was procured. Additionally, MDH did
not document its justification for these modifications, nor could it explain why
9

--- Page 12 ---
separate procurements were not issued for these services.7 Furthermore, MDH
could not document any negotiations for the modifications and based the
modifications on the vendor’s price proposals. As a result, there is a lack of
assurance that the cost of the modifications was reasonable.

Prior Finding 7
MDH did not always comply with State procurement regulations when
procuring goods and services via sole source and emergency contracts and
did not always publish contract solicitations and awards as required.
Prior Report Recommendation 7
We recommend that MDH ensure that
a. sufficient documented justifications exist for sole source (repeat) and
emergency procurements;
b. documented price negotiations are conducted as appropriate (repeat);
c. BPW is notified of emergency procurements, including the one noted above
(repeat); and
d. solicitations and awards are published on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage
(eMMA) as required (repeat), including the ones noted above.
Status as Determined by MDH – In Progress
OLA Assessment of Status – In Progress
While MDH implemented recommendation c, it did not fully implement
recommendations a, b, and d.
In regard to recommendation a, our test of five sole source contracts awarded
between November 2023 and November 2024 totaling $3.7 million disclosed that
the use of the sole source procurement method for one contract was not justified
since MDH had identified numerous other vendors that could perform the services
(sign language interpretation). In addition, the justifications for two sole source
contracts awarded in July and September 2024 were not prepared until after we
requested this documentation in December 2024.
In regard to recommendation b, as noted in our assessment of Finding 6 above,
MDH did not document price negotiations for the initial award and subsequent
modifications to an emergency contract that collectively totaled $21.3 million.
Accordingly, we determined that the recommendation was still in progress.
For recommendation d, our test of seven contracts totaling $10.2 million disclosed
that as of January 2025, MDH had not published three contract awards on eMMA
that were awarded between 6 to 13 months prior to that date. In addition, the
award for one contract awarded in December 2023 was published in August 2024,
7 months beyond the 30-day requirement.
11

Payroll
Prior Finding 14
MDH had not established adequate controls to ensure the propriety of
biweekly payroll adjustments, leave balances, and timesheets.
Prior Report Recommendation 14
We recommend that MDH
a. independently verify pay and leave balance adjustments to ensure that only
authorized adjustments have been processed and take appropriate corrective
action when errors are noted (repeat);
b. retroactively verify that the time recorded on timesheets approved by payroll
unit employees were actually worked, including those noted above (repeat);
and
c. reconcile total payroll as reflected in the Central Payroll Bureau (CPB) payroll
registers each pay period with SPS payroll summary reports, investigate any
differences, and ensure that those reconciliations are documented (repeat).
Status as Determined by MDH – Complete
OLA Assessment of Status – In Progress
MDH implemented recommendation c but had not fully implemented
recommendations a and b. In regard to recommendation a, while MDH advised
that it enhanced its review of pay and leave balance adjustments, our test of six
payroll adjustments processed between September and November 2024 disclosed
that these reviews were not always properly performed. Specifically, the
supervisor did not obtain documentation to support four of the adjustments tested,
including one adjustment that resulted in the employee being overpaid by $1,400.
MDH advised that it would pursue recovery of this overpayment after we brought
the matter to its attention.
For recommendation b, MDH advised that it developed a procedure to
retroactively verify that time recorded on timesheets approved by payroll unit
employees were actually worked, but had not implemented the procedure as of
January 2025.

Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We conducted a follow-up review of the actions taken by the Maryland
Department of Health (MDH) – Office of the Secretary and Other Units to
address the findings in our October 19, 2023 audit report. In that report, we
concluded that MDH’s accountability and compliance rating was unsatisfactory.
The purpose of our review was to determine the status of MDH’s corrective
actions to address certain of our audit findings and recommendations. As
customary, our review did not include all prior report findings and
recommendations, but a number judgmentally selected based on our assessment
of significance. This review was conducted under the authority of Section 2-
1220(a)(4) of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland
and was based on our long-standing practice of performing a follow-up review
whenever an agency receives an unsatisfactory rating in its fiscal compliance
audit report. The rating system was established, in accordance with State
Government Article, Section 2-1221, of the Annotated Code of Maryland, for the
purpose of determining an overall evaluation of an agency’s fiscal accountability
and compliance with State laws and regulations.
Our review consisted of obtaining a status report from MDH as of September 30,
2024, which described the level of implementation of each prior audit report
finding, as well as obtaining additional clarifications from MDH of the actions
taken to resolve the selected findings. Our review also consisted of performing
tests and analyses of certain information and holding discussions with MDH
personnel, as we deemed necessary, to determine the status of MDH’s corrective
actions to address the selected findings, including the related recommendations,
from our October 19, 2023 audit report.
State Government Article Section 2-1224(i) requires that we redact in a manner
consistent with auditing best practices any cybersecurity findings before a report
is made available to the public. This results in the issuance of two different
versions of a report that contains cybersecurity findings – a redacted version for
the public and an unredacted version for government officials responsible for
acting on our audit recommendations.
The State Finance and Procurement Article, Section 3A-301(b), states that
cybersecurity is defined as “processes or capabilities wherein systems,
communications, and information are protected and defended against damage,
unauthorized use or modification, and exploitation”. Based on that definition, and
in our professional judgment, we concluded that findings in this report fall under
that definition. Consequently, for the publicly available report all specifics as to
13

--- Page 16 ---
the nature of the cybersecurity findings and required corrective actions have been
redacted. We have determined that such aforementioned practices support the
redaction of this information from the public report. The specifics of the
cybersecurity findings have been communicated to MDH and those parties
responsible for acting on our recommendations in an unredacted report.
This review did not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Had we conducted an audit in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, other matters
may have come to our attention that would have been reported.
Our review was conducted primarily during the period from December 2024 to
February 2025, and our assessment of the status of MDH’s corrective actions was
performed at the time of our review.
MDH’s response to our follow-up review is included as an appendix to this report.
Depending on the version of the report, responses to any cybersecurity findings
may be redacted in accordance with State law. As prescribed in the State
Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, we will
advise MDH regarding the results of our review of its response.

6b: Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center (Perkins) is Maryland’s
only maximum-security psychiatric facility. It supports 289
patients, with a waitlist for admissions. MDH’s top priority is
always ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of the patients
and staff. Additionally, there is no other available capacity within
the state designed to address the needs of the patients.
If the HVAC system at Perkins fails, the facility becomes
uninhabitable within thirty-six (36) hours and would require the

Agency Response Form
patients and staff to evacuate. However, if MDH was able to find
capacity to evacuate the facility, that evacuation would have to
start well before the thirty-six (36) hour mark.
Furthermore, with a failed HVAC system the facility’s
infrastructure would be in jeopardy, risking the potential of burst
pipes, flooding, mold, and resulting property damage. If those
resulting damages occurred, the State would not have a facility in
which to house these patients until repairs were made.
Given this context and ensuring the health, safety, and well-being
of the patients and staff, MDH acted accordingly.
In making the determination as to engage in contract
modifications, MDH consulted the Maryland Board of Public
Works (BPW) Advisory 1995-1. This advisory provides guidance
to Maryland agencies, allowing modifications of existing
contracts, even when a new contract is under development or
already underway. This is often done to address unforeseen
changes, ensure continuity of services, or adapt to evolving needs
without needing to cancel or reissue a contract. The BPW
Advisory 1995-1 states that contract extensions must be for valid
reasons, such as ensuring service continuity. If a new procurement
or solution is already in progress, the existing contract should end
when the new one is ready and not be extended for an indefinite
reason. Extensions can only occur in specific situations and must
be approved by the Board of Public Works (BPW).
On January 31, 2024, MDH issued a Using Agency Request to
DGS to retain AE services in support of the development of a Part
I and Part II Program of Requirements for a comprehensive
buildings’ systems replacement. The development of the POR
would form the basis of an MDH Capital Improvement Project
(CIP) submission to the Department of Budget and Management
Capital Budgeting Office and petition for CIP funding.

Agency Response Form
On April 3, 2024, MDH issued a second Using Agency Request to
DGS for support for project management, bidding, and
construction administration for a project to replace HVAC
Component Replacement at Perkins. This project would
eventually form the basis of the Expedited Non-Competitive
Procurement for HVAC Component Replacement approved by
the BPW on December 4, 2024.
From April through October 2024, MDH and DGS worked to
retain AE services, assess building systems, develop a scope of
work and cost projections, identify funding, and develop a project
schedule. Concurrent with this work MDH, with DGS support,
developed and submitted a Part I & II Program of Requirements
(titled Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center Heating, Cooling, and
Distribution Infrastructure Component Replacement) to the DBM
Capital Budget Office for review and approval, and also submitted
a Capital Improvement Program funding request for FY 2026
funding in the amount of $12.5M.
On October 11, 2024, MDH received DBM approval of the
Program of Requirements for the CIP funded project.
Per the BPW Advisory, contract modifications are permitted even
when a new contract is under development. Modifications must be
for valid reasons, such as ensuring service continuity.
Modification #6, approved by BPW on September 11, 2024, was a
modification to ensure continuity of service operations until the
HVAC Component Replacement project can be completed.
MDH acted with the knowledge available at the time within the
context of the situation, moving forward, MDH will consider
competitive procurements and sole source contracts for continuity
of services.

PayAdjustments: Managers within OHR’s Payroll and
Timekeeping Unit review pay adjustments (inputs) and supporting
documentation submitted by MDH payroll coordinators each week
to ensure that they are accurately reviewed, verified, and recorded
and confirm that only authorized adjustments are processed and
paid. Pay adjustments will not be processed without the supporting
documentation. If pay adjustment errors are noted during
processing, the appropriate corrective actions are taken by the
payroll manager, including manual review of input forms and
supporting documentation, coordination of error resolution with
the assigned Payroll personnel, and final submission of inputs to
DBM.

Leave Balance Adjustments: OHR’s Payroll and Timekeeping
Unit instituted a leave adjustment review process to confirm the
accuracy and proper recording of leave adjustments to prevent
and/or correct the processing of unauthorized adjustments. If errors
are noted upon review, appropriate corrective actions are taken.
OHR’s corrective and preventative measures include an internal
review and audit of a randomized selection of 35% of records to
ensure compliance with leave adjustment standards.
Timesheet Certification: OHR has implemented a revised
timesheet certification process to ensure the accurate review and
verification of merit and contractual timesheets that were approved
by OHR timekeepers. When timesheets with missing initial entries
are identified, email-based outreach is initiated to obtain
confirmation from the respective supervisors regarding the missing
information. This outreach is conducted weekly on Thursdays by
assigned Payroll personnel, following the conclusion of the
Office’s standard weekly payroll activities.
If supervisors fail to confirm the missing entries within two weeks
of the initial outreach, the assigned Payroll personnel escalate the
matter to the Chief of Payroll. The Chief then sends follow-up
email communications to the supervisors, urging them to complete
the certification process. Additionally, a quarterly report is
generated and sent to management, listing subordinate staff with
uncertified timesheets for that quarter.
To strengthen accountability, Payroll will collaborate with the
Employment Services Division to notify the manager of any
delinquent supervisors. This notification will prompt discussions
and implementation of corrective actions to address negligence in
fulfilling supervisory responsibilities.
All corrective actions are complete as of 03/14/2025.
