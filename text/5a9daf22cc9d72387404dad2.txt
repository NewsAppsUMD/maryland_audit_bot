Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Family Health Administration (FHA) works to
prevent and control chronic diseases; prevent
injuries; provide public health information; and
promote healthy behaviors in Marylanders. In
addition, FHA strives to ensure that quality
health care services are available, especially for
at-risk and vulnerable people.
(cid:190) FHA is also responsible for administering the
Tobacco Use and Prevention and Cessation
Program and the Cancer Prevention, Education,
Screening, and Treatment Program. These
Programs are financed by the Cigarette
Restitution Fund (CRF).
(cid:190) During FY 2007, FHA expenditures totaled
approximately $203 million, including $46
million applicable to the CRF.
(cid:190) Audit report included eight findings, with one
finding repeated from the preceding audit report.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Substantive action was not taken when a vendor
did not meet contract requirements.
Subsequently, critical Maryland Cancer Registry
(MCR) data under the control of the vendor was
determined to be deliberately altered. (Finding 1)
(cid:190) FHA did not exercise adequate oversight of CRF
grants to ensure compliance with program goals
and fiscal requirements. (Finding 2)
(cid:190) Claims processing deficiencies were noted for the
State funded Breast and Cervical Cancer
Diagnosis and Treatment Program (BCCDTP). In
addition, FHA did not ensure it maximized Federal
recoveries and minimized State expenditures by
determining if BCCDTP recipients were eligible for
Medicaid. (Findings 5 and 6)
(cid:190) FHA did not properly monitor and account for
grants to the Prince George’s Hospital Center.
(Finding 7)

Maryland Cancer Registry
Dataset Problems
(cid:190) FHA did not take any substantive action when a
vendor failed to attain a national certification for
Maryland Cancer Registry (MCR) for the 2001
dataset, as required by the contract. (Finding 1)
(cid:190) Certain registry data (mainly for the 2001 and
2002 datasets) under control of the vendor
were determined to be deliberately altered to
indicate that numerous individuals had cancer
when they did not.
(cid:190) The 2002 dataset was not reviewed until August
2005. FHA noted significant increases in the
number of cases of cervical cancer and
melanoma (for example, more than 90%
increase in cervical cases from 1998 to 2002)
and when questioned, the vendor could not
provide an adequate explanation.

Maryland Cancer Registry - continued
(cid:190) In July 2005, FHA sent letters to 2,300 patients,
who per the MCR had breast or cervical cancer,
requesting that they be part of a DHMH study.
Subsequently, FHA received calls from individuals
who had received the letters, but had never been
diagnosed as having cancer. FHA later estimated
that up to 400 individuals who were sent letters
were erroneously listed on the MCR as having
cancer.
Investigations
(cid:190) In May 2006, FHA received information regarding
the deliberate alterations of the MCR data and
referred the matter to the DHMH-OIG. An
investigation was conducted, the aforementioned
study was suspended, and the vendor terminated
the employee responsible for the MCR data.
(cid:190) The vendor also completed its own investigation
and determined that over 13% of all cases in
diagnosis year 2002 showed some sign of
alteration.

(cid:190) Changes were made after the cases were
initially entered into the MCR by the laboratory
facility or provider. For example, a significant
number of discrepancies between the
lab/provider reports and the comparable MCR
data for prostate cancer cases were noted, with
3,895 and 3,248 discrepancies in the 2001
and 2002 datasets, respectively.
(cid:190) The vendor concluded that these changes were
methodical and were made by one or more
persons with broad access to the system, and
not a result of a random set of events.
Impact
(cid:190) Recipients of the MCR data (such as, federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
other states, and researchers) were using
incorrect data.
(cid:190) MCR data is also used in the award of local
public health grants.

Cigarette Restitution Fund
Certain grants from the Cigarette Restitution Fund
(CRF) were not adequately monitored. (Finding 2)
During FY 2007 over $38 million in grants were
disbursed from the CRF.
(cid:190) Required annual site visits of grantees to verify
compliance with program goals and fiscal
requirements were not conducted for grants
totaling $28 million.
(cid:190) Four of five grantees tested, which received
$4.7 million during FY 2007, did not meet
specific performance requirements and no
corrective action plans were obtained.
(cid:190) FHA reduced the performance requirements for
two other grantees that received $1.2 million to
more closely align with the actual results.
(cid:190) Certain grantees had not submitted annual
expenditure reports.

Breast & Cervical Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment
The Breast and Cervical Cancer Diagnosis and
Treatment Program (BCCDTP) is a State-funded
program that pays for diagnostic and treatment
services provided to low-income individuals with
qualifying medical conditions. During FY 2007, FHA
paid medical providers $12.6 million on behalf of
4,200 recipients.
Claims Processing Deficiencies (Finding 5)
(cid:190) FY 2007 claims totaling $7.7 million were
processed for payment using system overrides and
did not receive supervisory review. Consequently,
there was a lack of assurance that the claims were
proper.
(cid:190) FHA routinely paid claims submitted by providers
more than nine months after the date of service, in
violation of State regulations. We estimate that
approximately $545,000 in claims paid during FY
2007 were submitted on average 13 months after
the date of service. Some had service dates dating
back to 2003.

BCCDTP - continued
Potential Recipient Eligibility for Medicaid
(Finding 6)
Since BCCDTP is primarily financed by general
funds, enrolling participants in Medicaid reduces
the State’s expenditures. Consequently, State
regulations require all BCCDTP recipients to apply
for Medicaid.
(cid:190) Although FHA sent letters to recipients after
they enrolled in BCCDTP requesting that they
apply for Medicaid, FHA continued to pay
claims and continued the recipients’ eligibility,
even when the recipients did not apply for
Medicaid. According to FHA’s records, 745
recipients did not respond to the letters and
could potentially be Medicaid eligible.
(cid:190) Due to computer programming deficiencies,
weekly automated matches of BCCDTP and
Medicaid recipients would not always alert FHA
if recipients were enrolled in Medicaid.

Prince George’s Hospital Center Grants
FHA did not properly monitor and account for
grant funds totaling $11.3 million ($6.3 million
general funds and $5 million special funds)
awarded to Prince George’s Hospital Center for
fiscal years 2006 and 2007. (Finding 7)
For example,
(cid:190) The grant agreement did not include a
provision that required the Center to provide a
budget detailing how the funds were to be
spent.
(cid:190) The annual reports submitted by the grantee
did not detail how the funds were spent.
(cid:190) FHA did not perform annual financial audits.
The Center disclosed that FY 07 State grant
funds totaling $701,103 were used for
expenditures related to two other hospitals
due to a system error.

Conclusion
FHA should:
(cid:131) Take substantive action when conditions of a
contract are not met or document why no
action was taken. FHA should also work with
the appropriate agencies to investigate and
resolve the aforementioned alterations to the
MCR data.
(cid:131) Exercise adequate oversight of grants funded
by the CRF.
(cid:131) Address the internal control deficiencies
regarding the BCCDTP claims processed, and
institute appropriate procedures to maximize
Federal recoveries.
(cid:131) Properly monitor grant funds provided to the
Prince George’s Hospital Center.
