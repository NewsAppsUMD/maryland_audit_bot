Significant Audit Findings
August 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017
1) Maryland Department of Health (MDH) – Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA)
(8/18/17 – 43 pages – 15 Findings)
As a result of the significance of our audit findings and the number of repeat findings, OLA
determined that MCPA’s accountability and compliance level was unsatisfactory, in accordance
with the rating system we established in conformity with State law.
 MCPA did not have adequate procedures and controls over the Medicaid enrollment and
eligibility process. MCPA did not enroll 11,153 new recipients in a Managed Care
Organization (MCO) in a timely manner resulting in MCPA paying certain recipients’ claims
on a fee-for-service basis rather than the claims being paid by an MCO. MCPA could not
determine the fiscal impact of these delays without an analysis of each recipient’s claim
activities. Our test of the 10 highest fee-for-service claims paid during fiscal year 2015
disclosed that 4 claims totaling $826,000 would have been paid by an MCO had the
recipient been enrolled in an MCO timely.
 MCPA’s memoranda of understanding with the Department of Human Services and the
Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, the two entities that are responsible for processing the
majority of eligibility determinations, did not contain provisions for quality assurance
procedures to ensure that recipient eligibility determinations were proper and did not specify
the actions to be taken when fraud or abuse was identified.
 MCPA did not conduct timely follow-up on potentially ineligible Medicaid recipients it had
referred to the appropriate local department of social services (LDSS) for resolution. For
example, as of June 2015, 2,721 instances identified at three LDSSs had been outstanding
for an average of 79, 125, and 194 days, and 266 alerts statewide related to long-term care
recipients had been outstanding for an average of 201 days.
 MCPA did not take certain actions or establish adequate processes to maximize recoveries
from other sources to reduce Medicaid payments to providers. Timely action had not been
taken to ensure Medicaid recipients age 65 or older had applied for Medicare, which
generally reduces Medicaid payments. According to its records, MCPA paid claims during
fiscal year 2015 totaling $85.4 million for 4,133 recipients who were at least 65 and were not
enrolled in Medicare, despite being potentially eligible. Furthermore, MCPA did not ensure
that all potential third-party health insurance information for Medicaid recipients was
received and properly investigated in a timely manner.
 MCPA did not institute certain security measures and controls over its information systems,
and did not ensure recipient’s personally identifiable information and protected health
information maintained by both MCPA and its vendors were safeguarded.

Significant Audit Findings
August 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017
2) MDH – Office of the Secretary and Other Units (8/30/17 – 36 pages – 17 Findings)
As a result of the significance of our audit findings and the number of repeat findings, OLA
determined that MDH’s accountability and compliance level was unsatisfactory, in accordance
with the rating system we established in conformity with State law.
 MDH did not provide adequate oversight of and guidance to its administrations to ensure
interagency agreements with State universities, which are not competitively procured, are
appropriate and represent the best value to MDH. During an approximate three-year
period, there were 304 such agreements in effect valued at $329.5 million. In many cases,
the agreements allowed MDH administrations to augment their staff beyond their authorized
positions. It appears that 102 of the 304 agreements totaling $122.7 million were used for
this purpose. Furthermore, State universities typically charged administration fees ranging
up to 31 percent of the agreement value and MDH did not have a process to evaluate those
fees for reasonableness. Administration fees for the 304 agreements totaled $25.6 million.
 MDH did not always comply with State procurement regulations when awarding sole source
and emergency procurements. For example, MDH had not negotiated pricing for any of the
six sole source contracts tested, totaling $17.1 million, and for three of these contracts
totaling $8.7 million, it did not adequately justify the procurements as sole source awards.
In addition, MDH did not have a formal monitoring procedure to ensure contract awards
were consistently published, as required by State law and regulations.
 Supervisory reviews of federal fund reimbursement requests were not always effective. Our
review of 20 of these requests totaling $3 billion disclosed that 5 requests contained errors
totaling $27.2 million of which only one of these errors totaling $1.3 million was identified
through the review for correction.
 MDH’s Office of the Inspector General had not completed timely and/or comprehensive
audits of private providers, which received $196 million from MDH during fiscal year 2016.
The Office also lacked a formal process for oversight and monitoring of corrective actions
taken related to audits of both local health departments and private providers.
 There were a number of deficiencies with MDH’s security and control over its information
systems and network. For example, MDH inappropriately stored certain sensitive personally
identifiable information, including social security numbers stored in clear text along with
names, addresses, and dates of birth, for approximately 215,000 individuals without
adequate safeguards.

August 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017
3) Department of Human Services (DHS) – Office of the Secretary and Related Units
(9/12/17 – 25 pages – 13 Findings)
 DHS did not effectively administer contract terms and task order activity under a $125
million information technology (IT) contract. DHS did not have formal procedures to evaluate
the vendor cost proposals for each task order, nor was there any evidence DHS verified the
reasonableness of employee hours and related costs proposed by the vendor. Also, DHS
adopted a change in the billing process from a deliverable basis to a fixed-price installment
basis, which was not consistent with contract terms. This change resulted in DHS paying
approximately $4 million more than necessary for one project that was ultimately cancelled.
DHS issued and paid for $8.4 million in task orders beyond the $10 million authorized in the
contract for fiscal year 2015 without preparing a contract modification and obtaining Board
of Public Works approval as required by State procurement regulations.
 DHS did not properly plan and administer task order projects for the IT contract, resulting in
payments totaling approximately $10.1 million for a project that was subsequently cancelled,
including the $4 million referenced above. DHS did not formally cancel the project in a
timely manner, resulting in $781,000 being unnecessarily paid to the vendor. DHS
management advised us that it does not anticipate resuming the project; therefore, there is
no evidence that the deliverables received will provide any future benefits.
 DHS guaranteed a minimum compensation to two of eight legal firms awarded emergency
contracts resulting in approximately $616,000 more being paid than if the firms were
reimbursed on a per-case fee, which was the reimbursement method used for the other six
firms. DHS could not explain why some firms were offered this payment provision while
others were not. DHS also did not have adequate procedures to ensure payments made to
the legal firms, totaling $24.5 million from September 2013 through August 2015, were
proper and did not follow up on deficiencies regarding services provided that were noted
during annual site visits of the firms.
 DHS did not properly secure its information systems. Sensitive personally identifiable
information stored on several databases was not properly protected. Also, DHS did not
ensure, on an ongoing basis, that malware protection software was installed, up-to-date,
and operational on all its computers.
 DHS did not have adequate internal controls and record keeping with respect to grants,
purchases and disbursements, and payroll. For example, in August 2015, DHS paid a State
university’s $300,000 invoice in full, but as of March 2017, the billed services had not been
provided.

4) Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) (11/01/17 – 28 pages – 12 Findings)
 DJS procured certain youth care services via intergovernmental agreements with non-
private entities, which did not provide assurance that these services were obtained at the
best value to the State and DJS did not ensure that the related services were received. Six
agreements we tested, valued at $7.6 million, included administrative fee payments totaling
$523,000 to the entities to monitor non-private subcontractors that in some cases provided
all youth care services. These agreements did not require the entities to report on their
subcontractor monitoring efforts, nor had DJS monitored the entities for this oversight.
 Financial examinations of youth care service providers conducted by DJS were not sufficient
to ensure funds were spent on allowable costs and that excess payments were recovered.
Our review of 12 providers found 4 that were allowed to retain $380,000 in excess
payments without required justifications. During fiscal year 2015, DJS was under contract
with 81 providers for services valued at approximately $63.0 million.
 DJS circumvented State procurement regulations, including Board of Public Works and
control agency approvals, by artificially dividing procurements to certain vendors so as not
to require public solicitation of bids and public notification of the awards. During fiscal years
2014 through 2016, DJS paid 22 vendors $9 million, with $7.5 million for procurements of
$15,000 or less; including 204 purchases totaling $1.5 million from one vendor, of which 202
purchases were for $15,000 or less. These conditions also allowed certain questionable
purchasing activity to occur without detection since DJS employees, under delegated
authority were able to directly solicit, receive, evaluate bids, and select vendors without
extensive involvement of DJS procurement personnel. For example, DJS employees
accepted bids for 19 routine service procurements from 2 companies owned by the same
individuals, and these companies were the only bidders for 18 of these procurements. We
referred this matter to the Office of the Attorney General – Criminal Division.
 DJS did not maximize recovery of federal funds used to offset the cost of eligible residential
rehabilitation and treatment foster care services. Our tests disclosed that certain federal
reimbursement requests did not include all potentially eligible expenditures. In addition,
DJS did not take action to obtain federal Medicaid reimbursement for allowable residential
rehabilitation services and DJS has not recovered any such costs since July 1, 2015.
 DJS had not established sufficient controls to ensure that court-ordered restitution was
properly recorded, collected, and disbursed to crime victims. DJS admitted that its records
of restitution owed by juveniles are unreliable.
 DJS did not protect personally identifiable information of juveniles, such as names, social
security numbers and/or dates of birth, in both hardcopy and electronic formats.

5) Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) (11/14/17 – 22 pages – 8 Findings)
 BCCC’s Facilities Planning and Operations Department procurement deficiencies resulted in
a circumvention of State procurement regulations and lack of effective controls. Department
employees directly solicited, received, and evaluated bids and selected vendors to supply
maintenance goods and services.
o Many of these purchases were artificially divided to avoid competitive public solicitations
or the use of statewide contracts, as well as the involvement of BCCC’s central
procurement personnel. During a three-year period, the Department made 178
payments to the same seven vendors totaling $420,000, each below the $15,000
threshold requiring central personnel to perform procurement tasks.
o These procurement practices allowed certain questionable purchasing activity to occur
within the Department without detection. Our tests disclosed an apparent familial
relationship between vendors from which bids were directly solicited and questionable
payments totaling $73,900, such as payments for maintenance services performed in
rooms or on equipment that did not exist.
o Department employees shared their corporate purchasing cards (CPC), precluding
effective accountability and control, and did not have documentation, such as detailed
invoices, to support certain payments, as required by State CPC policy. Our review of
five payments for maintenance services totaling $10,900 disclosed three purchases
totaling $6,500 that were not supported.
 BCCC granted salary incentives or increases totaling $129,250 to four senior management
positions without adequate justification, including three increases that were not approved by
its Board of Trustees.
 BCCC did not have a current and comprehensive agreement with its affiliated foundation
and the most recent agreement did not contain any operational goals or outcomes to be
achieved by the foundation. BCCC paid the salaries and benefits for the foundation’s three
employees, which totaled $524,846 during fiscal years 2015 and 2016, representing 65
percent of the foundation’s total revenue during those years.
 There were several deficiencies with BCCC’s security and control over its information
systems and data, such as the lack of protection for personally identifiable information.

6) DHS – Social Services Administration (SSA) (11/20/17 – 37 pages – 14 Findings)
Due to the number and significance of our audit findings, OLA determined that SSA’s
accountability and compliance level was unsatisfactory, in accordance with the rating system
we established in conformity with State law.
 SSA did not have a comprehensive quality assurance program to ensure that child welfare
programs were being properly administered by the local departments of social services
(LDSSs) that are responsible for case management functions, including the monitoring of
child placements, providers, and investigating reports of abuse and neglect. SSA had not
established LDSS oversight or the oversight was insufficient in the following areas:
o Foster care placement recordkeeping
o Medical and dental exams for foster care children
o School attendance for school-aged children
o Approval, monitoring, and continued eligibility of family foster care providers, and
adoptive parents and guardians
o Continued program eligibility of children over the age of 18
o Child abuse and neglect investigations
o Substance-exposed newborn risk assessments
o Children born to individuals with parental rights previously terminated
In each of these areas, we identified instances in which the LDSSs were not complying with
SSA requirements, State regulations, or law. For example, based on a judgmental selection
of 57 foster care children monitored by 10 different LDSSs, we determined that evidence
was lacking regarding compliance with 31 percent of five required attributes tested, such as
medical exams. According to SSA records, during fiscal year 2016, approximately 17,000
children participated in SSA programs and were served by 9,000 providers/parents at a cost
of approximately $270 million.
 SSA did not maximize the recovery of federal reimbursement for eligible children in foster
care, as well as those in adoption and guardianship programs. Eligibility decisions were not
subject to effective supervisory reviews, and our test of 36 children for which federal funding
was not being received identified 18 cases for which children were incorrectly identified as
ineligible, resulting in the failure to recover $1 million in federal funds. We also identified
instances in which the State was not collecting Supplemental Security Income to apply
against the cost of care for eligible children.
 Financial information from providers of child placement services, such as group homes,
were not reviewed timely to identify and recoup overpayments. As of September 2016, most
of the approximately 90 provider financial reports for fiscal year 2014 had not been
completed and none of fiscal year 2015 reports were reviewed.

7) Department of Transportation – Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) (11/22/17 – 29 pages
– 12 Findings)
 A focused internal investigation conducted by MVA in 2016 identified 270 fraudulent
federally non-compliant driver’s licenses and identification cards (products) that had been
issued based on counterfeit documents at one branch over a six-month period. However,
MVA did not expand its investigation to determine the full extent of such occurrences and
did not alter its procedures to address the related control deficiencies. Our expanded
analysis identified 329 additional products that may have been improperly issued;
accordingly, further investigation is warranted.
 MVA had not established sufficient controls over its inventory stock of driver’s license and
identification cards, and could not account for 7,500 cards received in June 2016, which
could be used for improper purposes.
 MVA did not ensure that all driving records were being reviewed for possible administrative
action. After our inquiries, MVA determined that certain cases in which the driver had
already accumulated 8 or 12 points on his or her driving record were being incorrectly
excluded from MVA established review procedures. Our test of 31 excluded records
disclosed that required administrative action, such as license suspension, was not taken
against 8 drivers.
 MVA did not ensure that required supervisory reviews of 5% of the critical transactions
recorded on driving records, such as the addition or removal of a license suspension or
revocation, were adequately performed and documented. Our test of 1,044 critical
transactions processed by 10 employees over five days disclosed that, although 46 (4.4
percent) of the critical transactions tested had been reviewed, none of the 176 transactions
processed by 2 employees were reviewed.
 By using a competitive procurement process instead of an existing State master contract,
MVA did not ensure that a $21.4 million IT services contract was procured at the most
favorable labor rates available. In addition, MVA’s procedures for monitoring this and other
IT contracts, including the review of related billings, were not effective in ensuring the
receipt of all deliverables, compliance with all contract terms, and the reasonableness of the
hours billed and paid.
 Effective controls were not established over MVA’s virtual servers associated with its eStore
and 15% of its computer workstations were not adequately secured with malware protection.
 A number of other internal control and record keeping deficiencies were noted in areas
including cash receipts, the Ignition Interlock Program, and corporate purchasing cards.
