Background Information
Agency Responsibilities
The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) was
established to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland in Maryland.
MALPF, which is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of 13 members,
purchases land easements with Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund
(Fund) revenue and places certain restrictions on the use of the land (for example,
the land cannot be subdivided for residential or commercial purposes). The Fund,
which is administered by MALPF, generally derives funding from State transfer
taxes, agricultural transfer taxes, and local subdivision matching funds. In
addition, MALPF uses proceeds of General Obligation bonds to fund easement
purchases. No State transfer taxes were received by the Fund during fiscal year
2012 as a result of the Budget Reconciliation and Financing Act of 2011 which
transferred these collections to the State’s General Fund. According to MALPF’s
records, since inception through June 30, 2012, it had purchased 2,078 easements
on 283,915 acres of land for a total cost of approximately $610 million.
Financial Information
Attached, as Exhibit A, is a schedule of the financial activity of the Special
Revenue Fund and Installment Contracts for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.
This schedule is not intended to, and does not provide the financial position and
results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
In addition, certain other financial statements (for example, a balance sheet) and
disclosures have not been provided as would be required by generally accepted
accounting principles. The schedule was prepared on a modified accrual basis of
accounting which provides that revenues are recognized when they become
available and measurable, and expenditures are recognized when the related
liability is incurred.
As of June 30, 2012, the total resources available to finance future expenditures
including easement acquisitions were $22,761,988. The fund balance in the
Special Revenue Fund was $10,616,166 as of June 30, 2012. The Special
Revenue Fund balance is reserved for easement acquisitions that were approved
by MALPF’s Board of Trustees, but were not presented to the landowners as well
as offers accepted by the landowners that were awaiting Board of Public Works
approval or settlement at year end. In addition to its special fund appropriation,
MALPF received certain General Obligation bond authorizations. Accordingly,
bond funds available to finance future expenditures totaled $12,145,822 at June

30, 2012. The fund balance as of June 30, 2012 in the Installment Contracts
Fund ($6,479,232) represents funds committed for the payment of easements
purchased by MALPF on an installment basis.
Status of Findings From Preceding Audit Report
Our audit included a review to determine the status of the two findings contained
in our preceding audit report dated June 6, 2012. We determined that MALPF
satisfactorily addressed both of these findings.
Findings and Recommendations
Easement Violations
Finding 1
The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) did not
ensure that all noted easement violations were resolved in a timely manner.
Analysis
MALPF did not ensure that all noted easement violations were resolved in a
timely manner. Violations may be noted, for example, during periodic easement
inspections performed by the counties, and include conditions such as an
improper dwelling on the property or a subdivision problem. Although a record
of easement violations was established in a database, MALPF did not periodically
review the database to ensure follow up was performed and corrective actions had
been taken on all violations by the landowner to comply with easement terms.
As of January 31, 2013, the current MALPF database indicated approximately
281 unresolved violations. According to MALPF management, 33 of these
violations were duplicates but, of the remaining 248 violations, it considered 31
violations to be either high priority (such as subdivision violations) or medium
priority (such as debris issues). According to MALPF records, these violations
have remained unresolved for periods of up to 6 years.
As a result of the aforementioned condition, MALPF lacked assurance that noted
easement violations were resolved in a timely manner and that the land owners
complied with the terms of the easement. The MALPF Easement Inspection
Policy requires that the counties perform inspections on a minimum of 10 percent
of their existing State funded easement properties and 100 percent of their
federally funded easement properties each year. Inspection reports submitted by
4

--- Page 7 ---
the county offices are entered into MALPF’s database, and MALPF is responsible
for notifying the landowners of noted violations. State regulations allow MALPF
to impose civil penalties of $2,500 per day per violation (up to a $50,000
maximum) on a landowner as a result of uncorrected violations although no
penalties were imposed during fiscal year 2012.
Recommendation 1
We recommend that MALPF
a. perform appropriate and timely follow-up actions on outstanding
easement violations to ensure that corrective actions were taken; and
b. determine the current status of the aforementioned unresolved violations
and impose penalties, if deemed appropriate.
Audit Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
We have audited the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (Fund) for
the fiscal ending June 30, 2012. The audit was conducted in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
As prescribed by the State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, the objectives of this audit were to examine the Fund’s
financial transactions, records, and internal control, and to evaluate its compliance
with applicable State laws, rules, and regulations. We audit the Fund annually as
required by the Agriculture Article, Section 2-505 of the Code. We also
determined the status of the findings contained in our preceding audit report.
In planning and conducting our audit, we focused on the major financial-related
areas of operations based on assessments of materiality and risk. The areas
addressed by the audit included disbursements for the purchase of easements, as
well as receipt of agricultural land transfer taxes, and compliance with easement
terms. Our audit procedures included inquiries of appropriate personnel,
inspections of documents and records, and observations of the Fund’s operations.
We also tested transactions and performed other auditing procedures that we
considered necessary to achieve our objectives. Data provided in this report for
background or informational purposes were deemed reasonable, but were not
independently verified.

Our audit did not include certain support services provided to the Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) by the Department of
Agriculture. These support services (such as purchasing, data processing,
maintenance of accounting records, and related fiscal functions) are included
within the scope of our audit of the Department.
MALPF management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control. Internal control is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance that objectives pertaining to the reliability of financial records,
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including safeguarding of assets, and
compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations are achieved.
Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud may
nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that conditions may
change or compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Our reports are designed to assist the Maryland General Assembly in exercising
its legislative oversight function and to provide constructive recommendations for
improving State operations. As a result, our reports generally do not address
activities we reviewed that are functioning properly.
This report includes a finding relating to a condition that we consider to be a
significant deficiency in the design or operation of internal control that could
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to maintain reliable financial records, operate
effectively and efficiently, and/or comply with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations. This finding is also regarded as a significant instance of
noncompliance with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.
The Department of Agriculture’s response, on behalf of MALPF, to our findings
and recommendations is included as an appendix to this report. As prescribed in
the State Government Article, Section 2-1224 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, we will advise the Department regarding the results of our review of its
response.

Finding
Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) does not have adequate
procedures in place to monitor easement violations and to ensure that violations noted are
resolved in a timely manner.
Agency Response:
MALPF concurs with the finding and acknowledges the need for better communication
among staff for better follow up and resolution of easement violations.
MALPF has an existing database to record and monitor easement violations. MALPF
staff understands that they must adhere to a regular review of the database and commit to a more
consistent population of the database. The monitoring and enforcement coordinator will
conduct a comprehensive review of the database three times a year, and MALPF administrators
will commit to entering the violations that they identify into the database. While the database
may not currently reflect the latest information, MALPF regularly reviews existing violations,
prioritizes them in terms of gravity, and addresses them in a timely manner.
Both the administrators and the monitoring and enforcement coordinator work closely
with the assigned Assistant Attorney General to address violations. Working together, the staff
and Assistant Attorney General notify landowners about violations by letter, and then engage in
a negotiation process with the landowner or the landowner’s attorney to resolve the violation.
