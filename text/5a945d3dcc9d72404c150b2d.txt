Introduction and Scope
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires each
county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in Maryland to file annual
(or once every four years under specified conditions) audit reports. There were
193 local government audit reports due for fiscal year 2012 (25 counties, 154
cities and towns, and 14 taxing districts). The reports are to include financial
statements, with accompanying notes, and auditors’ reports that express opinions
as to whether the financial statements are fairly presented. The financial
statements are required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. We have prepared and distributed audit guidelines to provide
additional information regarding the accounting, reporting, and auditing
requirements.
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Code requires the Office of Legislative Audits to
perform a desk review of each local government’s annual audit report for
compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing standards.
Subsections (b) through (f) of Section 40 specify the reporting and review
requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by the counties. The
applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special taxing district’s
compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting the
districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is required to
review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2012 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts, as
well as four fiscal year 2011 reports (Baltimore City, Town of Deer Park, Town
of Fairmount Heights, and Town of Forest Heights). The desk reviews were
performed to accomplish the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and accounting and
auditing standards.
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits).
 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances or unfavorable trends and ratios, based on analyses of financial
data over the most recent five-year period (July 1, 2007 through June 30,
2012).

We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2012 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
Certain audit reports were not filed or were not filed on time.
One local government had not filed audit reports for fiscal years 2011 and 2012,
and four other local governments had not filed audit reports for fiscal year 2012.
Furthermore, 41 local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date. The failure of a local government to file an audit report, or a delay in
filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The submission
of audit reports after the required filing date was also noted for 17 of these 41
local governments during our preceding year’s review. Article 19, Section 40(a)
of the Annotated Code of Maryland generally requires audit reports to be filed by
November 1 after the close of the fiscal year or by January 1 after the close of the
fiscal year for those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Audit reports for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2012 had not
been received, as of August 9, 2013, for the City of Hyattsville. The failure of
this city to submit audit reports has been reported to the Executive Director of the
Department of Legislative Services. If these reports are not filed, the State
Comptroller, acting upon the advice of the Executive Director, is authorized by
law to discontinue the payment of all funds, grants, or State aid to which the city
is entitled.
Additionally, audit reports for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 had not been
received, as of August 9, 2013, for the following four local governments:
1. Baltimore City
2. Town of Deer Park
3. City of Fruitland
4. Town of Sharptown
We will review these fiscal year 2012 audit reports and take any follow-up action
necessary when the reports are received. The results of these reviews will be
included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2013 local government audit
reports.
The town of Eagle Harbor and the Ellerslie and Mount Savage special taxing
areas requested and were granted a waiver from filing an audit report in fiscal
year 2012 because the local governments met the conditions for filing an audit
report every fourth year as provided for under Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Code. These entities will next be required to file an audit report for fiscal year
6

--- Page 9 ---
2015. The towns of Barclay, Burkittsville, Marydel, Port Tobacco, and
Templeville had previously requested and were granted waivers from filing audit
reports. These entities will next be required to file audit reports for either fiscal
year 2013 or fiscal year 2014.
The auditor’s report for one local government contained an adverse opinion
on one opinion unit and a qualified opinion on another opinion unit.
The auditor’s report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion (a
statement that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles) on the discretely presented component
unit opinion unit because of the omission of financial data for the Town’s
component unit. Specifically, financial data related to a development corporation
that is a component unit of the Town had not been audited and was not included
in the Town’s financial statement.
The Town’s audit report also contained a qualified opinion (a statement that,
except for the effects of the matter to which the qualification relates, the financial
statements are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles) on the governmental activities opinion unit because the Town had not
measured the effect of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
49 entitled “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation
Obligations.” According to the report, certain buildings of the development
corporation contained asbestos and, although deemed improbable, the Town could
become liable for the cost of abatement.
As a result, the Town’s financial statements were not presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required by State law. The
Town’s audit reports for each fiscal year since 2009 also contained an adverse
opinion and a qualified opinion due to these situations.
Auditors’ reports for 13 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for 13 local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The auditor’s report for
two of these local governmental units included a deficiency that was also cited
during our preceding year’s review. The following is a summary of these
deficiencies:

Audit Reports
Auditor did not express an opinion(s) on all opinion 6
units or on all financial statements.
Auditor’s report did not report on all required 5
information (for example, supplemental information
accompanying the basic financial statements).
Auditor’s report did not report on all prior-period 2
financial information presented.
Article 19, Section 40(a) of the Annotated Code of Maryland requires that audits
be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. These
standards require, in part, that the auditor express an opinion(s) as to whether the
basic financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective
financial position, the respective changes in financial position, and cash flows,
where applicable, of the local government in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Financial Statements
Financial statements submitted by 19 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 19 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of two of these local governments included two such deficiencies, and
the financial statements of one of these local governments included a deficiency
that was also cited during our preceding year’s review. The following is a
summary of the deficiencies and the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
Governmental fund balances were not properly 10
classified.
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 8
presentation of net assets was improper).
All required financial statements were not presented or 3
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.

Financial statements and accompanying notes for 13 local governments did
not include certain disclosures required by generally accepted accounting
principles.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or in
the accompanying notes, for 13 audit reports. The audit report for one of these
local governments included two such deficiencies. Adequate disclosure is
necessary to facilitate the understanding of, and to provide for fair presentation of,
the financial information. The following is a summary of these areas of
insufficient disclosure and the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Area of Insufficient Disclosure
Instances
Long-term or short-term debt 10
Significant accounting policies 3
Cash and cash equivalents 1
Noncompliance with State Law
Financial statements of 12 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required
by State law.
Financial statements of 12 local governments contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law (Exhibit A). Article 95, Section 22 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
requires that deposits with financial institutions by local governmental units be
fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes the risk of loss of deposits in
the event the financial institution defaults. In addition, this law requires that
collateral be of the types specified in the State Finance and Procurement Article,
Section 6-202 of the Code.
Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.

Unrestricted general fund deficit balances were noted for two local
governments as of June 30, 2012.
Unrestricted general fund deficit balances were noted for two local governments
as of June 30, 2012 (Exhibit B). The general fund is used to account for most of
the current operating expenditures of a local governmental unit. A general fund
deficit balance represents the costs of current or past services that will need to be
financed in future periods. Consequently, a general fund deficit may indicate a
potential financial problem. One of these local governments has had a general
fund deficit since June 30, 2006, and the other has had such a deficit since June
30, 2008. In both cases, the local governments’ general fund deficits were
reduced during fiscal year 2012.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local
governments as of June 30, 2012.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for two local governments as
of June 30, 2012 (Exhibit C). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local governments had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Section 40(a) of the
Code. Subsections (b) through (f) of this Section require that certain types of
special taxing districts file annual audit or financial reports with the county in
which the districts are located within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year, in
accordance with the rules and regulations established by the applicable county.
The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each district’s compliance with
the applicable provisions of the law and for submitting copies of these reports to
the Office of Legislative Audits.
The required reports have not been filed for five special taxing districts as of
September 9, 2013.
As of September 9, 2013, we had not received the required reports for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2012 for five special taxing districts which are located in
Anne Arundel County. Anne Arundel County advised us that they were in the
10

--- Page 13 ---
process of pursuing compliance with applicable filing requirements for these
districts and that appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example,
withholding funds).
