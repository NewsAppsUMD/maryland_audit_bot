Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Baltimore Region is a separate budgetary
unit within the Department of Public Safety and
Correctional Services’ Division of Correction and
includes the following institutions for male
offenders:
(cid:131) Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center
(cid:131) Metropolitan Transition Center
(cid:131) Maryland Reception, Diagnostic, and
Classification Center
(cid:131) Baltimore City Correctional Center
(cid:131) Baltimore Pre-release Unit
(cid:190) As of June 30, 2009, the Region had a total
population of 3,202 inmates and during FY 2009
had expenditures totaling $132.8 million.
(cid:190) Our audit report included 10 findings, 6 of which
were repeated from our preceding audit report.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Serious oversight, record keeping, and
documentation deficiencies existed with
respect to the Region’s working and inmate
funds, as well as questions regarding specific
disbursements. These conditions indicated an
almost complete lack of control and
accountability over these funds. Based on the
matters noted, we referred these issues to the
Criminal Division of the Office of the Attorney
General.
(cid:190) Adequate procedures and controls, and records
had not been established over several other
financial areas including cash receipts, payroll,
and equipment.

Working Funds and Inmate Funds
Background:
(cid:190) The Region maintains a general (GWF) and an
inmate (IWF) working fund, each established by an
advance from the Comptroller of Maryland (COT),
consisting of a checking account & cash on hand.
(cid:190) Disbursements can be made by cash withdrawal
or by check and the funds are replenished through
the State’s transmittal process, using general
funds (GWF) or from inmate funds (IWF) held by
the State Treasurer.
(cid:190) COT policy requires the GWF to be used only for
emergency purchases in nominal amounts or for
travel and emergency payroll advances. The IWF
is used to disburse funds belonging to inmates at
their direction, or upon their release.
(cid:190) GWF disbursements totaled $283,000 between
July 1, 2006 and October 31, 2009. IWF
disbursements totaled $1.5 million between July
1, 2007 and October 31, 2009.

Working Funds and Inmate Funds (continued)
Record keeping for both the GWF and the IWF was
poor, contributing to a significant lack of
accountability & control over the funds. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) Checking account balances were not maintained
on a current basis. Consequently, daily balances
were not available, account reconciliations were
difficult or impractical to perform, and any
reconciliations or fund compositions that were
completed were unreliable.
(cid:131) Analyses prepared by us and by the Region at
our request, disclosed that IWF funds totaling
$15,500 and GWF funds totaling $14,400 could
not be accounted for.
(cid:131) Bank fees of $23,300 were incurred over a two-
year period, due primarily to checks being written
without sufficient funds on account.

Working Funds and Inmate Funds (continued)
(cid:190) The Region’s inmate account records were not
reconciled with the Comptroller’s corresponding
record of actual inmate funds held on deposit.
(Finding 2)
(cid:131) As of May 31, 2009, the Region’s total of
$698,556 exceeded the Comptroller’s balance
of $471,807 by $226,749.
(cid:131) This difference implies that funds on deposit
may not be sufficient to cover all inmate
account balances on record.

Working Funds and Inmate Funds (continued)
(cid:190) Certain basic internal controls were lacking for the
GWF and IWF, or existing controls were ineffective.
(Finding 3)
(cid:131) Access to GWF blank checks and signature plates
was not adequately restricted.
(cid:131) One employee exercised complete control over
cash withdrawn from the IWF, by requesting and
receiving the cash, & preparing it for distribution.
(cid:131) IWF disbursements & reimbursement requests
frequently lacked adequate supervisory review.
We identified 12 duplicate transmittals totaling
$28,235 that were submitted to the Comptroller
for reimbursement and one transmittal for
$70,454 that did not have any supporting
documentation to substantiate the
reimbursement request.

Working Funds and Inmate Funds (continued)
The Region periodically transferred funds between the
GWF and the IWF, impairing accountability over the
funds and circumventing the Comptroller’s approval
process for establishing the amount authorized for
each fund. We question the practice of comingling
State funds and funds belonging to inmates.
(Finding 4)
(cid:131) Four transfers totaling $48,829 were made between
the two funds during the period of 4/08 to 4/09,
including $31,500 temporarily advanced by the
Comptroller to the IWF. The advance was not repaid
to the Comptroller as required, but instead the
Region moved the funds to the GWF.
(cid:131) The Region received a $40,000 “loan” from the
inmate funds of another Region.
(cid:131) Our test of GWF checks found three totaling
$10,365 that were payable to the Region’s IWF, but
there was no justification on file for these payments.

Working Funds and Inmate Funds (continued)
The Region made numerous unsupported and
questionable check disbursements and cash
withdrawals from the working funds. (Finding 5)
(cid:131) A review of 37 GWF checks disclosed 25 for $19,536
without documentation substantiating the propriety
of the disbursement, including one for $2,000
payable to the IWF, for which we could find no
corresponding deposit in the IWF.
(cid:131) Authorizing documentation was not on file to
substantiate the propriety of any employee salary
advances issued from the GWF prior to fiscal year
2008. In fiscal year 2007 alone, 72 advances for
$53,000 were issued from the GWF.
(cid:131) A review of documents supporting approximately 270
cash withdrawals totaling $10,500 from the IWF for
the purpose of paying inmates upon their release,
disclosed that the vast majority did not include the
inmate’s signature as required by DPSCS policy.

Working Funds and Inmate Funds (continued)
Further analysis of certain transactions in Finding 5,
disclosed highly questionable disbursements.
(cid:131) A $541 GWF check was issued in February
2008 to a former employee who had resigned
in June 2005. No authorizing documentation
was on file.
(cid:131) A GWF salary advance of $1,117 was issued to
an employee just prior to the individual’s
retirement in July 2009. This employee
already had an outstanding salary advance of
$1,052 dating back to October 2007. Neither
amount had been repaid as of January 2010.
(cid:131) Seven salary advances totaling $7,474 were
paid from the IWF. As previously noted, inmate
funds are the property of inmates. They
should not be used to advance funds to
Region employees.

Other Control and Record Keeping Issues
(cid:190) Procedures and controls relating to the
accountability and verification of cash receipts
were not sufficient. Cash receipts totaled $4.1
million during fiscal year 2009. For example, many
pre-numbered receipt forms (used to record
collections) were missing from inventory and
chargeback transactions (NSF checks) totaling
$174,000 were not investigated. (Finding 6)
(cid:190) Procedures had not been established during our
audit period to ensure that payroll adjustments
recorded on automated timekeeping reports, such
as adding overtime worked, were subject to
independent supervisory review. (Finding 7)
(cid:190) Equipment records were not properly maintained.
For example, acquired equipment was not always
recorded in the detail equipment records, and
some equipment that was recorded could not be
located. (Findings 9)

Conclusion
The Region needs to:
(cid:190) Establish proper accountability and controls over both
its working funds and inmate funds by:
(cid:131) Maintaining accurate records and preparing timely
reconciliations and fund compositions.
(cid:131) Requiring proper separation of duties, and ensuring
that transactions are subject to supervisory review.
(cid:131) Complying with established State procedures for
adjusting working fund balances when necessary
and maintaining adequate documentation to support
disbursements and withdrawals.
(cid:131) Investigating the proper disposition of unaccounted
for and improperly transferred funds, and
questionable working fund transactions identified,
and recovering outstanding advances.
(cid:190) Ensure that adequate procedures, controls, and
records have been established and implemented for
other Region fiscal processes, such as cash receipts.
