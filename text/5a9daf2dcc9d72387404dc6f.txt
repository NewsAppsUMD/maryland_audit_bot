Reports Recommended for Committee Action
Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2013 to November 30, 2014
1) Department of General Services – Office of Procurement and Logistics (OPL)
(11/8/13 – 30 pages – 13 Findings)
• The structure of the five-year $305 million State fuel contract procurement may have
limited competition, resulting in only one bidder being eligible for the contract award.
OPL did not consider rebidding the contract to provide greater assurance that the State
received the best value. OPL also did not timely obtain certain contract deliverables,
such as proof of insurance, and did not ensure State agencies were billed the proper
fuel rates.
• A deliverable specified under the $3.7 million eMaryland Marketplace (eMM) contract
was not implemented as intended and OPL did not seek to modify the related contract
price. In addition, certain features of eMM that would enhance the documentation,
security, and efficiency of procurements, such as the electronic bid function, were not
being used by State agencies.
• OPL did not document that it was in the best interest of the State to participate in
certain Intergovernmental Cooperative Purchasing Agreements (ICPAs) valued at
$41.5 million. ICPAs are contracts that are intended to promote efficiency and savings
that can result from intergovernmental cooperative purchasing. OPL also did not
ensure one ICPA vendor was pricing its goods in accordance with the related contract,
resulting in certain pricing discrepancies going undetected.
• OPL assessed fees on certain contracts without statutory authority, without disclosing
the fees to appropriate control agencies, and without ensuring that vendors
subsequently remitted the fees.
• OPL did not ensure that prices of goods and services offered by providers that receive
preferences for State agency purchases of goods and services were set at fair market
value. For example, OPL did not determine and publish the fair market prices of all
goods and services offered by Maryland Correctional Enterprises. OPL also did not
adequately monitor the State’s Employment Works Program designed to facilitate the
distribution of the State’s procurements of goods and services among community
service providers and businesses owned by individuals with disabilities.
• OPL did not exercise appropriate oversight over DGS-controlled Statewide purchasing
transactions, State property, and DGS equipment.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2013 to November 30, 2014
2) State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) (12/16/13 – 30 pages – 11
Findings)
• Certain aspects of SDAT’s quality assurance process for real property assessments
needed improvement to help ensure local assessment offices were complying with its
policies. For example, SDAT had not established written policies specifying the
documentation to be prepared by local assessment supervisors evidencing their review
and approval of assessment values. Furthermore, SDAT policies lacked specificity
regarding the documentation to be maintained to support certain assessment values
and to evidence the review and approval of those values by local office supervisors.
• Physical exterior inspections were not performed for all properties every three years as
required by State law and a record of inspections performed was not maintained. At
the time of the audit, the State’s total assessable real property tax base was valued at
approximately $690 billion.
• SDAT’s centralized real property database system (Assessment Administration and
Valuation System - AAVS) had access vulnerabilities that placed critical assessment
data at risk of unauthorized modification. For example, all AAVS users, including those
with read-only access could modify critical data without a record identifying the
changes being prepared. Furthermore, SDAT did not establish procedures to ensure
that certain data (such as property sales and permit information) received from local
jurisdictions were properly recorded in AAVS.
• Personal property returns submitted by businesses for calendar years 2008 through
2011 had not been reviewed to ensure the values reported to SDAT were proper, and
appropriate actions were not taken to identify businesses that failed to file or submitted
returns late. SDAT also had not completed audits of applications received from
individuals who qualified for homeowners’ and renters’ tax credits during calendar
years 2009 through 2011.
• Security and control weaknesses were noted with respect to SDAT’s information
systems and network, and proper internal controls were not established for certain
payments to contractors and for the processing of cash receipts.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2013 to November 30, 2014
3) State Board of Elections (SBE) (3/24/14 – 22 pages – 9 Findings)
• SBE’s bundling of tasks in a consolidated procurement of its voting system support
services contract in 2010 may have resulted in limiting competition. Only one proposal
for $20.9 million was received and SBE could not provide sufficient documentation that
evaluations of the technical and price proposals were performed to ensure that costs
were reasonable and that all requirements were met prior to awarding the contract.
Additionally, SBE did not modify the voter system support services contract when the
contract’s scope was significantly reduced and did not submit contract modifications to
the Board of Public Works, as required by State regulations.
• SBE had not established internal controls over purchasing transactions to ensure they
were properly reviewed and approved. According to the State’s accounting records,
during fiscal year 2012, SBE’s expenditures through the Financial Management
Information System totaled approximately $11 million of which $9.2 million were
processed without sufficient approval. Furthermore, appropriate justification was not
always provided for sole source procurements.
• Procedures over cash receipts, which totaled approximately $7 million in fiscal year
2012, lacked control and accountability. For example, deposit verifications were not
properly performed and deposits were not made timely.
• SBE did not adequately investigate and resolve delinquent accounts receivable totaling
$2 million that were noted in our preceding audit report, and did not adequately review
non-cash credit adjustments, which totaled approximately $1.4 million during our audit
period.
• SBE had not recovered indirect costs for federal grants because it did not prepare an
indirect cost recovery plan as required by State policy. Consequently, a portion of the
federal funds received for the grants, which could have been used to cover certain
indirect costs of administering the grants, was instead used for direct program costs.
According to the State’s records, during fiscal years 2010 through 2012, federal fund
expenditures for the aforementioned grants totaled approximately $19.8 million.
• Potential security concerns over the Online Voter Registration System, which allows
citizens to register to vote and update voter registration records online, were noted in
September 2012 by an independent security research team, but not properly
addressed by SBE until fiscal year 2014. In addition, adequate procedures were not in
place to ensure convicted felons serving court-ordered sentences were removed from
the voter registration database.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2013 to November 30, 2014
4) State Corporate Purchasing Card (CPC) Program (Performance) (3/26/14 – 24
pages – 2 Findings)
We conducted a performance audit of the State’s CPC program to identify processes and
data analysis techniques that could be used to enhance the integrity of the Program. For
fiscal year 2013, State CPC purchases totaled $260 million and since inception of the
Program through June 30, 2013, State agency purchases have totaled $3 billion.
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) has established certain
policies and practices to help ensure that CPCs are used for appropriate purposes. Both
automated and manual process controls have been established. However, additional
actions should be taken by GAD to improve controls and further promote the integrity of
the CPC program.
• GAD had not required State agencies to use L-3 data to assist in monitoring
cardholders’ purchasing activities. L-3 data, which are available from the purchasing
card bank, includes significant descriptive information captured by certain merchants
for each purchase, such as item description and quantity, combined with detailed
merchant information and cardholder information. Our examination of L-3 data
identified four cardholders who made inappropriate CPC purchases which, based on
our investigation and the investigations of the agencies involved, totaled $255,000. We
found that L-3 data item descriptions alone can raise suspicion, such as the purchase
of obviously inappropriate items like guitars and toy soldier figures. Also, attempts to
conceal improper purchases are obvious when the items purchased described in the L-
3 data do not agree to the cardholders’ descriptions of the items purchased as
recorded in their purchase activity logs.
• GAD had not established or sponsored orientation and training programs for agencies
on other available techniques for analyzing and assessing the propriety of CPC
transactions. These techniques include reviewing or identifying declined transactions,
multiple vendors at one address, similar employee and vendor addresses, high dollar
volume of purchases by one cardholder from an obscure vendor, and purchases
structured to avoid transaction limits.

5) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – Medical Care Programs
Administration (MCPA) (4/25/14 – 26 pages – 9 Findings)
• Two federal audits recommended recoveries from the State. For example, an audit
issued in December 2013 disclosed that MCPA drew down $115.3 million in federal
funds for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 that were not supported by actual
expenditures. MCPA generally agreed with the audit findings and refunded or would
refund the questioned reimbursements.
• MCPA did not adequately monitor certain vendors contracted to assist in verifying
amounts billed by hospitals, long-term care (LTC) providers, and Managed Care
Organizations (MCOs) and to recover related overpayments. For example,
 Audits of medical records to ensure hospital services billed were actually provided
were not conducted for hospital claims after 2007. Furthermore, MCPA did not
adequately monitor the vendor responsible for ensuring hospital charges were for
medically-necessary procedures and services. Payments for hospital services
totaled $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2012.
 MCPA did not conduct patient credit balance audits at LTC facilities prior to October
2011 to identify funds due the State from provider billing errors, duplicate payments,
and/or third-party collections. Further, cost settlements with the facilities were not
conducted on a timely basis. Payments to LTC facilities totaled $1.1 billion in fiscal
year 2012.
 MCPA did not ensure a vendor responsible for enrolling new applicants in MCOs
met certain contract performance requirements. In response to our concerns,
MCPA recovered $900,000 from the vendor.
• MCPA did not take appropriate action to maximize the recovery of funds from other
sources, such as third-party insurers and Medicare, to reduce Medicaid costs.
 MCPA did not ensure that referrals of potential third-party insurance for Medicaid
recipients were properly and timely investigated. Supervisory reviews were not
conducted to ensure investigations were completed, appropriate conclusions
reached. MCPA received 89,000 referrals during fiscal year 2013.
 Procedures were inadequate to maximize Medicare funding. For example, a
process was not in place to ensure that Medicaid recipients age 65 or older had
applied for Medicare as required by State regulations (to reduce State costs).
• MCPA needs to continue efforts to address longstanding deficiencies with recipient
enrollment procedures as well as to improve information system security.

Significant Audit Findings
November 1, 2013 to November 30, 2014
6) Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) (5/15/14 – 26 pages – 12 Findings)
• DJS had not established proper internal controls in a number of areas to ensure that
financial transactions were properly authorized and supported.
 User access capabilities were not properly restricted to prevent unauthorized
disbursement transactions in the State’s Financial Management Information System
and evidence was lacking to ensure that the alternate approval process established
by DJS was effectively performed. Numerous employees could initiate and approve
certain disbursement transactions without independent approval.
 Adequate procedures were not in place to verify the accuracy of billings totaling
approximately $2.3 million that were paid for electronic monitoring services.
 Several vendors were routinely used for individual small purchases of goods and
services without obtaining competitive bids as required, and certain maintenance
contracts were split to circumvent procurement oversight and documentation
requirements.
 Corporate purchasing card transactions were not thoroughly reviewed and
approved, allowing one employee to make $91,000 in unauthorized purchases.
• DJS did not ensure that youth care contractors submitted financial statements as
required nor did DJS conduct timely audits of youth care contract expenditures to
identify overpayments as required by its policy. Approximately 53% of financial
statements reviewed were submitted after the required due date and 34% of the
required audits were not completed within one year after receiving the statements.
• DJS did not ensure that certain payroll adjustments and caseworker determinations of
youths deemed ineligible for federal funding were subject to supervisory approval. For
example, out of an OLA test of 42 adjustments for other payroll earnings totaling
$612,000, DJS could not provide documentation of supervisory approval for 13
payments of $220,000.
• DJS did not adequately control access to the restitution accounts receivable system
and critical transactions were not reviewed timely. These deficiencies allowed
overpayments totaling $134,000 to occur without timely detection.
• DJS’ access and monitoring controls over its automated case management system
were not sufficient to properly protect critical sensitive data.
• Physical inventories of equipment were not conducted at required intervals and related
record keeping was deficient.

7) Maryland Department of Aging (MDOA) (7/1/14 – 22 pages – 7 Findings)
MDOA is responsible for identifying the needs of the State’s elderly and ensuring that
those needs are met through a comprehensive network of accessible services at the local
level. MDOA has divided the State into 19 geographical regions and each region is served
by a local Area Agency on Aging (AAA), which is either a local government agency or a
nonprofit organization.
• MDOA lacked evidence to substantiate that certain activities of AAAs were properly
monitored.
 A comprehensive policy was lacking to ensure that financial reviews of the AAAs
were subject to supervisory review and contained adequate documentation to
evidence the appropriate use of State grant funds, which totaled $17.9 million
during fiscal year 2013. OLA’s examination of selected MDOA reviews found that
the results were poorly documented and lacked approval by supervisory personnel.
 Documentation of procedures performed and evidence examined by MDOA staff
during AAA site visits to verify eligibility of participants in two State elderly care
programs was not sufficient.
 AAA administrative expenditures relating to Senior Care grant funds were not
monitored to ensure they did not exceed the limit allowed by MDOA policy.
According to expenditure reports submitted by seven AAAs, several AAAs
exceeded that limit by a total of $552,000 for fiscal years 2012 and 2013.
 The timeliness of initial eligibility determinations and annual redeterminations for
participants of the Medicaid Waiver for Older Adults Program performed by AAAs
was not monitored, and there were frequent processing delays.
• Requests for reimbursement of federal fund expenditures were delayed resulting in
$39,000 in lost interest income to the State, and MDOA could not substantiate federal
fund accrued revenues totaling $3.7 million as of June 30, 2013.
• Authentication, monitoring, and backup controls over the MDOA Medicaid billing
system were not sufficient.

8) University System of Maryland (USM) – University of Maryland Eastern Shore
(UMES) (11/7/14 – 32 pages – 13 Findings)
• UMES did not exercise effective oversight of grants awarded to its affiliated Foundation
totaling $640,000.
 Two UMES management employees, who at different times during the audit period
also served as Foundation Executive Director, were allowed to exercise virtually
complete control over the grant transactions for both entities. In addition, the
related scope of the agreements between UMES and the Foundation was vague
and immeasurable. Also, UMES provided grant funding to the Foundation in
advance of the expenditures being incurred; but did not obtain documentation to
ensure the funds were spent for their intended purposes. Finally, OLA was unable
to account for a $25,000 UMES grant payment to the Foundation, a condition which
was referred to the Office of the Attorney General.
 The management employee who currently served as the Foundation Executive
Director was involved in business activities with the Foundation that were not
disclosed to UMES as required and raised questions regarding a potential conflict
of interest. This employee conducted business with the Foundation through a
limited liability corporation that this employee owned and these business activities
were financed, in part, by State grants provided by UMES. In addition, this
employee did not always file financial disclosure statements with the State Ethics
Commission.
 UMES disbursed federal funds totaling $385,000 to its affiliated Foundation for
purposes inconsistent with applicable federal regulations.
 UMES and its affiliated Foundation did not comply with certain USM policies. For
example, resources provided to the Foundation by UMES were not accurately
disclosed and required reports were not always submitted by the Foundation.
• UMES had not established adequate controls over certain aspects of its student
accounts receivable. For example, non-cash credit entries related to housing and
board charges were not adequately reviewed to ensure propriety and independent
reviews were not performed to ensure all eligible student accounts were timely referred
to the State’s Central Collection Unit.
• Numerous security and control issues were noted regarding UMES’ information
systems. For example, controls over UMES accounts and passwords were not
sufficient to protect this information, and personally identifiable information was
inappropriately stored in clear text.

9) Uninsured Employers’ Fund (UEF) (11/7/14 – 22 pages – 7 Findings)
UEF is responsible for paying workers’ compensation awards to claimants who failed to
receive payments from their employers because they did not have workers’ compensation
insurance, as required. UEF is also responsible for collecting assessments from certain
employers and insurance companies to fund these awards.
• Certain deficiencies existed with UEF’s processes to bill, monitor, and collect
assessments on Workers’ Compensation Commission (WCC) awards, as well as
medical payments made on behalf of claimants, from insurance companies and
employers.
 UEF did not have a process to ensure the accuracy of WCC awards entered in
its automated accounts receivable system. The awards are the basis for
assessments and billings to employers and insurers. Furthermore one employee
could process adjustments to receivable records without independent review
and approval. As of November 5, 2013, UEF’s account receivable balance
totaled $51.6 million.
 UEF’s automated accounts receivable system did not generate certain notices
to facilitate collection of delinquent accounts and did not generate accurate
accounts receivable aging reports. Furthermore, UEF did not refer delinquent
accounts to the State’s Central Collection Unit (CCU). According to UEF’s
records, $12.9 million of the November 5, 2013 receivable balance should have
been referred to CCU, based on the accounts age, but had not been.
• UEF indemnity payments made to claimants, totaling $3.6 million in fiscal year 2013,
were not subject to independent review and UEF did not obtain supporting
documentation for $1.4 million in fiscal year 2013 payments made to its third-party
administrator for managing certain claimants’ indemnification and medical expenses.
• UEF collections totaling $8.8 million in fiscal year 2013 were not properly verified to
deposit and responsibilities for performing certain functions were not properly separated.
• UEF’s information systems controls over security event monitoring and user access
were not sufficient. Furthermore, a disaster recovery plan was not in place and critical
programs and data files were not backed up offsite.
• UEF did not comply with State procurement regulations when it procured certain
services.

10) Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) (11/20/14 – 34 pages – 14 Findings)
As a result of the significance of our audit findings, OLA determined that MIA’s fiscal
accountability and compliance level was unsatisfactory, in accordance with the rating
system OLA established in conformity with State law.
• MIA’s procurement of a new automated premium tax system did not comply with State
procurement regulations and one MIA management employee exercised control over
virtually all aspects of the procurement and implementation of the new system. In
addition, the system development and implementation proceeded without a plan and
related specifications, and while the new system provided certain new capabilities,
other capabilities that were available in the former system were lost which, in absence
of proper manual controls, adversely impacted MIA operations. MIA collected premium
taxes totaling $458 million during fiscal year 2014.
• MIA allowed the premium tax system contractor complete control over the system.
Also, MIA lacked assurance that the system (the application, server, and database)
was properly secured and configured to protect it from external threats and
unauthorized changes.
• MIA had not established adequate controls over audits of premium tax filings, including
a lack of independent supervisory review of audit results. For example, OLA tests of 43
tax audits found inaccuracies or deficiencies with 11 audits, with premium tax payments
totaling $50.9 million, including the issuance of a duplicate account credit of $403,000
and the failure to assess penalties and interest of $158,000.
• MIA’s procedures were not sufficient to ensure certain tax payments were received
timely. OLA tests of 27 payments totaling $7.4 million found penalties and interest
were not always assessed for late payments. OLA estimated $156,000 in penalties and
interest could have been assessed, but were not.
• MIA had not established proper internal controls over premium tax refunds. For
example, certain refunds were approved and authorized for payment by the same
supervisory employee and OLA identified 28 potential duplicate refunds totaling
$361,000. In addition, MIA did not reconcile its records of premium tax revenues with
the corresponding State accounting records.
• MIA had not established sufficient controls over the issuance of producer licenses and
MIA lacked assurance that the outsourced producer and pre-licensing services systems
were protected against operational and security risks.
• Effective controls were not established over financial examination services, cash
receipts, purchases and disbursements, and MIA’s information technology network.
