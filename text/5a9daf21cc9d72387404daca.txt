Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
(DHMH) is responsible for promoting the health
of the public and for strengthening partnerships
between State and local governments, the
business community, and all health care
providers in Maryland regarding health care.
The following units were included in this audit:
(cid:131) Office of the Secretary (excluding the Health
Professional Boards and Commission)
(cid:131) Deputy Secretary for Health Care Financing
(cid:131) Operations
(cid:131) Deputy Secretary for Public Health Services
(cid:190) During FY 2006, expenditures for these four
units totaled approximately $55 million.
(cid:190) Audit report included 14 findings. 8 findings
from DHMH’s preceding audit report were
repeated.

Key Audit Issues
(cid:190) Adequate controls were not established over the
issuance of, accounting for, and safeguarding of
vital records, including birth certificates.
(cid:190) DHMH did not properly oversee the issuance and
security of vital records by the local heath
departments.
(cid:190) Access to DHMH’s vital records automated
system was not adequately restricted.
(cid:190) Subprovider budgets were not always reviewed
and expenditures were not always audited.
(cid:190) Various health care facilities were not inspected
annually as required by State law.

Inadequate Controls Over Vital Records
(cid:190) Sufficient documentation was not always
provided by applicants for certified copies of
birth certificates. (Finding 1)
(cid:190) DHMH did not use prenumbered forms for all
vital records. As a result, DHMH could not
adequately account for the forms and the
related collections.
(cid:190) For the forms that were prenumbered, DHMH
did not adequately account for the forms as to
issued, voided, or on hand.
(cid:190) Original birth certificates, prenumbered blank
stock certificates, and completed applications
were not always adequately secured.
(cid:190) Most of these deficiencies were commented
upon in our preceding audit report. The lack of
controls over prenumbered certificates has
been commented upon in our reports dating
back to 1999.

Lack of Oversight of Local Health Departments
(cid:190) DHMH did not properly oversee the issuance
and security of vital records by the local health
departments (LHDs) to ensure compliance with
laws, regulations and security procedures.
(Finding 2)
(cid:190) As a result, procedures over issuance of
certificates were inconsistent and not always
adequate.
(cid:190) Because certificates are issued in many
locations, the need for proper oversight is
critical.
(cid:190) A similar situation was commented upon in our
preceding audit report.

Access to Automated System Not Restricted
(cid:190) DHMH did not periodically review access to the
automated vital records system to ensure that
capabilities assigned to employees were proper.
(Finding 3)
(cid:190) Consequently, users were assigned additional
capabilities that were not needed, which could
result in birth certificates being issued to
unauthorized individuals.
(cid:190) For example, we noted 26 users that had the
capability to add and/or change birth
information and to print the related certificates.
Another 5 users had this capability but also had
routine access to cash collections received from
the sale of the certificates.
(cid:190) A similar situation was commented upon in our
preceding audit report.

Inadequate Monitoring of Subproviders
(cid:190) DHMH provided $438 million in annual financial
assistance to local health departments (LHDs)
and private providers during FY 2006. In many
instances, these primary providers subsequently
awarded funding to subproviders, such as drug
treatment programs and family planning clinics.
(Finding 4)
(cid:190) DHMH did not ensure that subprovider budgets
were reviewed and related expenditures were
audited.
(cid:190) For example, our test of 8 FY 2006 grants to
LHDs totaling $28.2 million disclosed that
subprovider budgets for 7 of these grants
($24.4 million) were not reviewed by the LHDs
or by the funding units.
(cid:190) Inadequate review of subprovider budgets and
lack of subprovider expenditure audits were
commented upon in our two preceding audit
reports.

Health Care Facilities Not Inspected Annually
(cid:190) DHMH had not inspected 73 percent of the
1,567 licensed assisted living facilities and
59 percent of the 186 facilities for the
developmentally disabled in FY 2006.
(Finding 5)
(cid:190) As of November 2006, inspections had not
been performed for most of the 337
unlicensed assisting living facilities that had
applied for licensure as far back as 1998.
(cid:190) These facilities will continue to operate unless
significant violations are reported.
(cid:190) State law requires that these facilities be
inspected at least annually.
(cid:190) Similar conditions were commented upon in
our prior audit report.

Other Findings of Interest
(cid:190) As of October 26, 2006, taxpayer donations to
the Cancer Fund totaling $890,000 had not
been spent since the Fund’s inception in April
2005. (Finding 6)
(cid:190) This fund was established by State law for
cancer research, prevention, and treatment.
(cid:190) A federal fund reimbursement totaling $72.9
million was not requested timely, resulting in
a loss of interest income to the General Fund
of approximately $396,000. (Finding 7)
(cid:190) Consequently, State general funds, which
would have otherwise been available for
investment, were used to finance federal fund
expenditures for extended periods.
