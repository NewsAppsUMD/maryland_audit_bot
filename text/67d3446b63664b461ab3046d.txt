Re: Audit of the Comptroller of Maryland – Information
Technology Division (Fiscal Operations)
The Honorable Brooke E. Lierman, Esq., Comptroller
Comptroller of Maryland
Goldstein Treasury Building
80 Calvert Street
Annapolis, Maryland 21404
Dear Comptroller Lierman:
We received your request for a 12-month delay of our upcoming audit of the Comptroller
of Maryland – Information Technology Division (Fiscal Operations) (COM-ITD) due to the
ongoing implementation of several Major Information Technology Development Projects
(MITDPs). To that end, we requested an implementation status for the 2 findings included in
our most recent report of COM-ITD. In response to our request, your Office provided a status
report, as of March 6, 2025, which indicated that COM-ITD had fully addressed both of the
report findings.
Based on the circumstances and the reported status of the prior findings, your request for
a 12-month delay of the COM-ITD audit has been approved.
Sincerely,
Brian S. Tanen
