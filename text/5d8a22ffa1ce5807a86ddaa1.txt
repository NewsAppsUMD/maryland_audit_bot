Introduction and Scope, Objectives, and Methodology
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires each county, incorporated city or town, and taxing district in
Maryland (referred to in this report as local governments) to file annual (or once
every four years under specified conditions) audit reports. There were 195 local
government audit reports due for our fiscal year 2018 review (24 counties, 157
cities and towns, and 14 taxing areas that are created under State law). The
reports are to include financial statements, with accompanying notes, and
auditors’ reports that express opinions as to whether the financial statements are
fairly presented. The financial statements are required to be prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and audited in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Finally, we annually
prepare and distribute audit guidelines to provide additional information regarding
the accounting, reporting, and auditing requirements.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-307 of the Code requires the Office of
Legislative Audits to perform a desk review of each local government’s annual
audit report for compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and
auditing standards. As part of the desk review process, we also addressed other
attributes as described below. Section 16-308 of the Article specifies the
reporting and review requirements applicable to special taxing districts created by
the counties. The applicable county is responsible for reviewing each special
taxing district’s compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and for
submitting the districts’ reports to the Office of Legislative Audits. The Office is
required to review the results of the counties’ reviews and the districts’ reports for
compliance with the law.
We conducted a desk review of each of the fiscal year 2018 reports that had been
received from the counties, incorporated cities and towns, and taxing districts.
We also reviewed one fiscal year 2013 and 2014 report (Town of Marydel); two
fiscal year 2015 reports (Town of Deer Park and Town of Marydel); two fiscal
year 2016 reports (City of Hyattsville and Town of Marydel); and five fiscal year
2017 reports (City of Hyattsville, Town of Marydel, City of Seat Pleasant, Bel Air
Special Taxing Area, and Washington Suburban Transit Commission) that were
received over the last year. The desk reviews consisted of reviewing each audit
report in order to accomplish the following tasks:
 Identify areas of noncompliance with our audit guidelines and certain
accounting and auditing standards pertaining to the presentation of the
financial statements and auditors’ reports.
5

--- Page 8 ---
 Identify any instances of noncompliance with certain provisions of State law
(for example, collateral for bank deposits, timely filing of audit reports).
 Identify local governments with potential financial problems relating to deficit
fund balances or unfavorable trends and ratios, based on analyses of financial
data over the most recent five-year period (July 1, 2013 through June 30,
2018).
We also reviewed each of the fiscal year 2018 special taxing district reports
received and the related results of the counties’ reviews of these reports. The
purpose of our review was to ensure that the counties had reviewed the reports
submitted for compliance with the provisions of the law and to identify instances
in which required reports were not submitted.
At the conclusion of our review, letters were sent to applicable local governments
and their independent auditors to notify them of the deficiencies disclosed during
the review so that corrective actions can be taken to help ensure future
compliance. Additionally, as appropriate, letters were also sent to local
governments, and to their legislative representatives, to communicate
noncompliance with State law or potential financial problems. For these issues,
the local governments were asked to advise us of corrective actions that will be
taken.

Results of Desk Reviews
Audit Reports
Finding 1
A number of local governments had not filed the required audit reports or
had filed after the required filing date.
As of July 26, 2019, eight local governments were delinquent in filing audit
reports as required by the Local Government Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland.
Local Government Fiscal Years Outstanding
Allegany County 2018
Town of Deer Park 2016, 2017, 2018
City of Hyattsville 2018
Town of Lonaconing 2017, 2018
City of Mount Rainier 2017, 2018
City of Seat Pleasant 2018
Bel Air Special Taxing Area 2018
Upper Potomac River Commission 2018
Furthermore, 18 local governments submitted audit reports after the required
filing date. The submission of audit reports after the required filing date was also
noted for 8 of these 18 local governments during at least our preceding year’s
review. The failure of a local government to file an audit report, or a delay in
filing, results in the lack of timely accountability to its citizens. The Local
Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of Maryland
generally requires audit reports to be filed on or before October 31 after the close
of the fiscal year or on or before December 31 after the close of the fiscal year for
those local governments with a population of more than 400,000.
Budget language adopted during the 2019 Session of the Maryland General
Assembly (Chapter 565, 2019 Laws of Maryland) resulted in the withholding of
certain transportation aid from the Town of Deer Park pending receipt of their
delinquent audit reports. Furthermore, failure to file a required report with the
Department of Legislative Services for three successive years provides the
Executive Director with reasonable cause to suppose that the municipality is no
longer actively operating under its charter, which could cause this town to have its
charter repealed. The failure of this local government to submit audit reports has
been reported to the Executive Director. The failure of the City of Mount Rainier
7

--- Page 10 ---
to file the required reports for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2017 and 2018 has
also been reported to the Executive Director.
Subsequent to July 26, 2019, Allegany County, the City of Seat Pleasant, and the
Upper Potomac River Commission submitted their audit reports for fiscal year
2018. Also subsequent to July 26, 2019, the Town of Lonaconing submitted its
audit report for fiscal year 2017, although its fiscal year 2018 audit report is still
outstanding.
We will review all delinquent audit reports and take any follow-up action
necessary when the reports are received. The results of these reviews will be
included in the report on our review of fiscal year 2019 local government audit
reports.
The towns of Barton, Brookview, Church Creek, Eagle Harbor, Eldorado,
Galestown, Goldsboro, Henderson, Hillsboro, Mardela Springs, Queen Anne,
Templeville, and the Ellerslie and Mount Savage Special Taxing Areas previously
requested and were granted waivers from filing audit reports. These local
governments met the conditions for filing an audit report every fourth year as
provided for under the Local Government Article, Section 16-305 of the Code
and, depending on the waiver period, will be required to file its next audit report
for either fiscal year 2019, 2020, or 2021.
Finding 2
The auditor’s report for one local government contained an adverse opinion
on one opinion unit.
The auditor’s report for the Town of Sykesville contained an adverse opinion (a
statement that the financial statements are not presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles) on the discretely presented component
unit opinion unit because of the omission of financial data for the Town’s
component unit. Specifically, financial data related to a development corporation
that is a component unit of the Town had not been audited and was not included
in the Town’s financial statement, thus resulting in the adverse opinion regarding
the discretely presented component units.
8

--- Page 11 ---
As a result, the Town’s financial statements were not presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as required by State law. The
Town’s audit report for each fiscal year since 2009 also contained an adverse
opinion due to this situation.
The auditor for the Town of Sykesville submitted a letter providing an
explanation regarding the opinion that was not unqualified, as required, but the
resolution of the applicable condition is uncertain.
Finding 3
Auditors’ reports for six local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards.
Auditors’ reports for six local governmental units were not presented in
accordance with certain generally accepted auditing standards. The following is a
summary of these deficiencies:
Number of
Area of Noncompliance
Audit Reports
Auditor’s report did not include all basic elements (for 4
example, auditor did not include an emphasis-of-
matter paragraph related to a change in accounting
principle).
Auditor’s report did not clearly express an opinion on all 2
basic financial statements.
The Local Government Article, Section 16-306 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland requires that audits be performed in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. These standards require, in part, that the auditor express an
opinion(s) as to whether the basic financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the respective financial position, the respective changes in
financial position, and cash flows, where applicable, of the local government in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Financial Statements
Finding 4
Financial statements submitted by 14 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.
Financial statements submitted by 14 local governments did not meet certain
requirements of generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of 1 of these 14 local governments included a deficiency that was also
cited during our preceding year’s review. The following is a summary of the
deficiencies and the corresponding number of instances:
Number of
Deficiency
Instances
Misclassification or improper presentation (for example, 7
presentation of net position was improper).
All required financial statements were not presented or 3
presentation of statement(s) was inappropriate.
Governmental fund balances were not properly 3
classified.
Items reported as assets, deferred outflows of resources, 1
liabilities, or deferred inflows of resources were not
properly displayed.
Finding 5
Financial statements, accompanying notes, and required supplementary
information did not include certain disclosures required by generally
accepted accounting principles for 11 local governments.
Certain required information was not included in the financial statements, or
disclosed in the accompanying notes or the required supplementary information,
for 11 audit reports. The financial statements of 1 of these 11 local governments
included two such deficiencies. Furthermore, the financial statements of 1 of
these local governments included a deficiency that was also cited during our
preceding year’s review. Adequate disclosure is necessary to facilitate the
understanding of and to provide for fair presentation of the financial information.
The following is a summary of the areas of insufficient disclosure and the
corresponding number of instances:

Noncompliance with State Law
Finding 6
Financial statements of 19 local governments contained disclosures that
cash deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as
required by State law.
Twenty financial statements for 19 local governments (primarily from fiscal year
2018, but also from fiscal years 2017 and 2015) contained disclosures that cash
deposits were not adequately collateralized, or otherwise insured, as required by
State law (Exhibit A). The Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland requires that deposits with financial institutions by
local governmental units be fully collateralized. Full collateralization minimizes
the risk of loss of deposits in the event the financial institution defaults. In
addition, this law requires that collateral be of the types specified in the State
Finance and Procurement Article, Section 6-202 of the Code.
Finding 7
One local government invested in equities, which is a violation of State law.
The financial statements of the Town of Morningside disclosed that the Town had
investments in equities, totaling $266,851 as of June 30, 2018, which is a
violation of State law. Local Government Article, Section 17-101 of the
Annotated Code of Maryland restricts the types of investments for local
governments to those specified in the State Finance and Procurement Article,
Section 6-222 of the Code. Investments not authorized by State law increase the
Town’s risk of loss associated with investments.

Potential Financial Problems
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the following potential financial
problems were noted based on the information presented in the local
governments’ audited financial statements and accompanying notes.
Finding 8
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for one local
government as of June 30, 2018.
Significant unfavorable trends and ratios were noted for one local government as
of June 30, 2018 (Exhibit B). The unfavorable trends and ratios occurred
because, over the five-year period reviewed, the local government had general
fund expenditures that exceeded general fund revenues, significant decreases in
general fund balances, and significant decreases in the ratio of general fund
balances to general fund expenditures.
Special Taxing Districts
The preceding contents of this report are applicable to local governments filing
audit reports in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Article,
Section 16-306 of the Code. Section 16-308 of this Article requires that certain
types of special taxing districts (created by a county) file annual audit or financial
reports with the county in which the districts are located not later than 90 days
after the close of the fiscal year, in accordance with the rules and regulations
established by the applicable county. The applicable county is responsible for
reviewing each district’s compliance with the applicable provisions of the law and
for submitting copies of these reports to the Office of Legislative Audits.
Finding 9
The required reports had not been filed for four special taxing districts as of
July 26, 2019.
As of July 26, 2019, we had not received the required reports for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2018 for four special taxing districts, which are located in Anne
Arundel County. Anne Arundel County advised us that they were in the process
of pursuing compliance with the applicable filing requirement for these districts
and that appropriate follow-up action would be taken (for example, withholding
funds).
