Background Information
The Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division (GAD) annually
provides State agencies with instructions for completing the fiscal year-end
budget closeout process. State agencies individually report to GAD their fiscal
year-end closing transactions that have not been previously recorded in the State’s
accounting records. GAD is responsible for closing the State’s accounting
records on a statewide basis and for preparing the State’s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR).
GAD contracts with an independent accounting firm for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the State’s basic financial statements contained in the CAFR. In its
audit report dated December 13, 2013, applicable to the fiscal year ended June 30,
2013, the firm stated that the State’s basic financial statements presented fairly, in
all material respects, the respective financial position of the State of Maryland as
of June 30, 2013, and the respective changes in the financial position and cash
flows, for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (referred to as GAAP).
The State’s CAFR states that, on a budgetary basis, the General Fund had an
unencumbered balance of approximately $501.9 million as of June 30, 2013. This
represents a decrease of approximately $49.3 million from the balance reported at
the preceding fiscal year-end ($551.2 million). The CAFR also states that the
State Reserve (Revenue Stabilization Account) balance totaled $720.2 million as
of June 30, 2013.
The budgetary General Fund balance does not reflect the effect of year-end
GAAP adjustments made to the State’s financial statements that were prepared on
a modified accrual basis of accounting. Certain GAAP adjustments, if recognized
on the budgetary basis, would have reduced the aforementioned unencumbered
budgetary General Fund balance of $501.9 million. For example, one GAAP
adjustment reduced the Fund balance by $646.2 million for State and local
income tax collections that were recorded as revenue for fiscal year 2013 but were
applicable to future fiscal years. This adjustment was $238.2 million larger than a
similar adjustment made for the fiscal year 2012 CAFR. Other GAAP
adjustments totaling $34.7 million were made for liabilities incurred by State
agencies during fiscal year 2013 for which general fund appropriations were not
available to finance the expenditures (see Exhibit 2).

Introduction, Objectives, and Scope
We conducted a review of the State’s budget closeout transactions for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2013. This review was conducted under the authority of the
State Government Article, Section 2-1221 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
The objective of our review was to determine whether budget closeout
transactions, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, were properly supported and
made in accordance with State budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting
policies.
Our review consisted of tests of significant year-end transactions for 26
Departments and independent agencies to ascertain if the transactions were
properly supported and made in accordance with State budgetary laws,
regulations, and accounting policies. We reviewed, on a limited basis,
transactions processed subsequent to June 30, 2013 to determine if the
transactions were properly recorded (such as charged or credited to the proper
fiscal year). We also reviewed the disposition of selected expenditure and
encumbrance transactions from the fiscal year 2012 closing to ensure they were
appropriately paid and remaining balances, if any, were cancelled.
As part of our current review, we contacted various officials of State agencies, as
well as the independent accounting firm under contract with the State to express
an opinion on its financial statements. Our review excluded public colleges and
universities and transactions processed through the Transportation Trust Fund
because the related financial activity does not involve the State’s General Fund
and/or because agencies have the authority to retain unspent funds at year-end.
Our conclusions for the aforementioned objective are contained on page 9 of this
report.
We also assessed the status of the 9 issues (appearing in five findings) identified
in our January 22, 2013 report entitled Statewide Review of Budget Closeout
Transactions for Fiscal Year 2012. We determined that 4 of the 9 issues had not
been resolved and are repeated in this report (see Exhibit 1).
Our review was limited to the procedures necessary to accomplish the
aforementioned objective. These procedures did not constitute an audit conducted
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
Had we conducted an audit in accordance with GAGAS, those standards would
require the issuance of recommendations as part of our reporting process. In
addition, other matters may have come to our attention that would have been
7

reported. We advised the appropriate agencies of our findings. Formal responses
were not requested since this report contains no recommendations. Our fieldwork
was conducted during the period from August 2013 to January 2014.

Findings
Closeout Transactions
Conclusion
Our review of State agencies’ budget closeout transactions disclosed that such
transactions were generally properly supported and made in accordance with State
budgetary laws, regulations, and accounting policies. However, we determined
that eight departments or units thereof were not in compliance primarily because
certain year-end transactions were not properly recorded, could not be
substantiated, or did not comply with budget closeout requirements.
Revenue Transactions
Several agencies recorded unsubstantiated revenues to offset various fund deficits.
Specifically, four State agencies recorded federal fund revenues totaling
approximately $17.6 million to cover expenditures even though there was no
indication that these revenues were available. In addition, special fund revenues
for one of those agencies had been recorded to cover special fund expenditures
totaling approximately $15.2 million, although collection of the special fund
revenue is doubtful. The use of general funds will likely be required to eliminate
the deficits resulting from these transactions. Furthermore, federal fund
reimbursements of $24.1 million for one State agency were disallowed, which
may also require the use of general funds to pay the resulting liability.
Expenditure Transactions
Two State agencies inappropriately encumbered general funds totaling $2.3
million at fiscal year-end to avoid reverting unused appropriations. Another State
agency did not use $1.3 million of general funds in accordance with a budgetary
law language for the appropriation. To eliminate an over-expenditure condition, a
fourth State agency transferred $600,000 of federal fund expenditures to general
fund expenditures in a separate budgetary unit that had unspent general fund
appropriations.
A summary of our findings, by agency, is included in Exhibit 1.
Prior Year Closing Encumbrances and Accrued Expenditures
Our review of the disposition of selected accrued expenditure and encumbrance
transactions from the fiscal year 2012 closing disclosed that the transactions were
properly liquidated or adequate documentation existed justifying why the
transaction had not been liquidated.

Revenue Transactions
Finding 1
The recovery of recorded federal revenues totaling approximately $17.6 million
is uncertain.
Analysis
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), the Department of
Human Resources (DHR), the Department of Aging (DOA), and the
Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) could not substantiate their ability to
collect federal fund revenues of approximately $6.5 million, $5.8 million, $3.7
million, and $1.6 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2013. If these agencies are
unable to recover these federal grant funds, general funds may be needed to
eliminate the resulting deficits.
MSDE
MSDE recorded year-end federal fund revenue transactions totaling $6.5 million
related to the Library Services Technology Act (LSTA) grant expenditures made
during fiscal years 2010 to 2013. MSDE has been unable to satisfy the
documentation requirements for reimbursement requests established by the
federal grantor agency subsequent to an audit conducted of MSDE’s fiscal year
2008 and 2009 LSTA grant expenditures. The report issued by the audit firm
engaged by the grantor agency questioned costs previously reimbursed to MSDE
totaling $783,866 due to the lack of adequate procedures and/or documentation to
support amounts charged to the grant for subgrantees, fringe benefit costs, other
direct costs, and administrative costs. This issue was commented upon in our
fiscal year 2012 budgetary closeout report; at June 30, 2012, MSDE recorded
federal fund revenues of $4.7 million related to LSTA expenditures.
DHR
DHR recorded federal fund revenue transactions of approximately $5.8 million at
June 30, 2013 related to Title XIX Medicaid claims for foster care children in
residential group homes and foster care programs receiving medical services.
However, DHR could not provide documentation to support any of the claims for
federal Medicaid reimbursement, which would consist primarily of
documentation from providers that the medical services were provided to eligible
children.
DOA
DOA recorded federal fund revenue transactions of approximately $3.7 million at
June 30, 2013 related to federal fund expenditures for the Money Follows the
Person grant and the Medicaid Waiver that were incurred during fiscal year 2013
and prior years. However, as of January 3, 2014, requests for reimbursement of
10

--- Page 13 ---
these expenditures had not been prepared. This issue was commented upon in our
preceding budgetary closeout report; at June 30, 2012, DOA recorded
unsubstantiated federal fund revenues of $2.9 million related to similar federal
fund expenditures.
DVA
Federal fund revenue transactions totaling approximately $1.6 million were
primarily recorded on DVA’s behalf by the Comptroller of Maryland – General
Accounting Division (GAD) to eliminate deficit balances that existed in several
federal programs as of June 30, 2013. Officials at DVA and GAD could not
provide any documentation supporting that the year-end recorded revenues would
be received. According to GAD, these deficits resulted from federal fund
expenditures incurred over a number of years and the deficit had increased by
$200,000 since June 30, 2012. This issue has been commented upon in our two
preceding budgetary closeout reports.
Finding 2
Special fund revenue transactions related to assistance payments totaling
approximately $15.2 million could not be substantiated.
Analysis
The Department of Human Resources (DHR) recorded special fund revenue
transactions of approximately $15.2 million at June 30, 2013 for Local
Department Operations Assistance Payments. These transactions were recorded
to eliminate a deficit balance in the assistance program special funds as of June
30, 2013. The deficit resulted from special fund expenditures that exceeded the
available special fund revenues during fiscal years 2010 through 2013 (including
$3.7 million for fiscal year 2013). This issue was commented upon in our
preceding budgetary closeout report.
Finding 3
The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has a liability to the federal
government of $24.1 million related to various disallowed claims.
Analysis
The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene – (DHMH) has a liability to
the federal government of approximately $24.1 million for disallowed claims
related to Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) residential service
costs and the Medical Care Programs Administration drug rebate program.
State general funds may be needed to repay the federal government. The
Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division recorded a decrease to
11

--- Page 14 ---
the General Fund in the State’s fiscal year 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report to recognize these disallowances.
As disclosed in our October 2, 2013 fiscal compliance audit report on DDA, DDA
residential service costs totaling approximately $20.6 million were disallowed by
the federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) – Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) in its September 2013 audit report which recommended
that DDA refund the overbilled amount to the federal government. On October 9,
2013, in response to the final OIG report, DHMH, on behalf of DDA, requested
that DHHS consider mitigation of the monetary findings in light of substantial
changes being made to management of the program and DHMH’s interest in
keeping as much funding as possible. As of January 8, 2014, there has been no
mitigation of the liability.
In November 2013, DHHS OIG issued another audit report disallowing $3.5
million of federal reimbursements because DHMH had not complied with federal
Medicaid requirements regarding rebates when billing manufacturers for
physician-administered drugs. The audit report recommended that DHMH refund
the $3.5 million.
Expenditure Transactions
Finding 4
Unexpended general fund appropriations totaling approximately $2.3 million
were not cancelled at fiscal year-end.
Analysis
The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE) and the Judiciary did not
cancel unexpended general fund appropriations totaling $1,660,000 and $618,000,
respectively, at fiscal year-end. Instead, encumbrances were inappropriately
recorded to retain these funds. This practice violated the yearly closing
instructions of the Comptroller of Maryland – General Accounting Division since
the encumbrances did not represent actual fiscal year-end commitments by the
State for goods or services and consequently would not qualify as valid
encumbrances.
MHBE
MHBE encumbered unused general fund appropriations totaling $1,660,000 so
that the funds could be retained and used for contractual agreements entered into
during fiscal year 2014. At June 30, 2013, MHBE did not have any obligations,
such as approved contracts, to support the encumbrance of these appropriations.
12

--- Page 15 ---
Judiciary
The Judiciary encumbered general fund appropriations totaling $618,000 for a
contract that expired at June 30, 2013. During the fiscal year-end closing, the
Judiciary encumbered the unspent balance of a $750,000 contract for installing
audio recording equipment. The Judiciary entered into the one-year contract on
July 1, 2011 and subsequently modified the contract to extend it another year
through June 30, 2013. During those two years, the Judiciary paid a total of
$132,000 for all goods and services provided under the contract.
Finding 5
The Department of Juvenile Services transferred, without proper
authorization, approximately $600,000 of federal fund expenditures related
to an overspent federal grant award to general fund expenditures in a
separate budgetary unit that had unspent general fund appropriations.
Analysis
The Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) transferred federal fund
expenditures to general fund expenditures in a separate budgetary unit without
proper approval. Specifically, DJS overspent a federal grant in DJS’ Residential
and Community Operations unit by approximately $600,000 (expenditures
exceeded federal fund appropriations and approved grant authorizations). At the
end of fiscal year 2013, DJS transferred the $600,000 in federal expenditures to
its DJS Baltimore City Region Community Operations unit, which had unspent
general fund appropriations to fund these costs.
DJS should have sought a budget amendment in accordance with Section 7-209 of
the State Finance and Procurement Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland to
transfer the available general fund appropriations to the unit that actually incurred
the expenditures.
Finding 6
The Maryland State Department of Education did not use certain general
fund appropriations in accordance with budgetary law language.
Analysis
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) did not use certain
general fund appropriations in accordance with budgetary law language.
Specifically, MSDE inappropriately spent approximately $1.3 million of general
funds on the State Share of Foundation Program that were designated in the
budget bill to be either transferred to the Guaranteed Tax Base Program (if
13

--- Page 16 ---
additional State funds were necessary for that program) or reverted to the State’s
General Fund. We were advised by MSDE that the budgetary language
restricting the use of the general fund appropriation was not complied with
because additional amounts were needed in the State Share Program to meet the
State’s per pupil funding specified in Section 5-202 of the Education Article of
the Annotated Code of Maryland. MSDE did not seek approval for this action.
Chapter 148, Laws of Maryland, 2012 provided that $1,376,467 of the fiscal year
2013 appropriation made for the State Share of Foundation Program shall not be
spent for that purpose and instead may only be transferred to the Guaranteed Tax
Base Program if additional State funds are necessary and any funds not expended
for this restricted purpose shall revert to the General Fund. At fiscal year 2013
year-end, MSDE only reverted $60,000 from the State Share of Foundation
Program to the State’s General fund, and none of the appropriation was
transferred to the Guaranteed Tax Base Program.
