AUDIT FINDING AND RECOMMENDATION
Develop and Implement Information Security Policies and Procedures
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (First Issued in 2019)
The Executive Secretary continues to explore options with respect to adoption of a security
standard and development of security policies and procedures. Industry best practices suggest that
entities prepare, disseminate, and maintain information security policies, standards, guidelines, and
procedures to facilitate effective implementation of an information security program.
Without documented and formally approved information security policies and procedures, the
Potomac River Fisheries Commission (Commission) cannot effectively communicate and implement
information security requirements to protect and mitigate risks to sensitive data. Additionally, the
Commission may inconsistently address security needs in the information technology (IT) environment,
increasing the potential of unauthorized access to data and reducing the ability to recover from system
outages timely, among other risks.
The Commission has not adopted an information security standard and lacks documented and
approved information security policies and procedures due to a lack of financial resources to hire full-
time IT personnel. Instead, the Commission uses outside contractors to help manage and maintain its IT
operations, and these contractors may not be fully cognizant of the requirements of the industry best
practices.
The Commission should continue to dedicate the necessary resources to select a security
standard, develop and formally approve information security policies and procedures, and implement
them into their information security program. The policies should align with the requirements in the
security standard the Commission selects and establish the minimum information security requirements
to implement in the Commission’s IT environment. Selecting an information security standard and
developing and implementing information security policies and procedures will help to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and achieve compliance with the security standard.

new bridge over the Potomac River. License revenues decreased overall by approximately five percent.
The Commission had the following expenses during the current and previous fiscal years.

Fiscal Year 2020

Total expenses increased by 48 percent from fiscal year 2019 due to an increase in oyster seeding
expenses including new seeding covered by the Maryland Department of Transportation grant. In
addition, the Commission upgraded and replaced their information technology equipment and software.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2020 with an operating profit of $92,193, including funding of
the retiree healthcare trust. In addition, the Commission ended the year with a positive operating cash
balance of $301,038 as shown in Chart 1. The available operating cash is a combination of money held
in three separate accounts: operating, Virginia Local Government Investment Pool, and Maryland Local
Government Investment Pool.

Fiscal Year

The Commission closed fiscal year 2020 with an overall cash balance of $1,074,253 in five
different bank accounts, which was a 14 percent increase, $132,295, over fiscal year 2019 levels. The
cash balance includes $205,150 in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts to fund future
oyster work and $486,251 in a separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree health care reserves.
The remaining three accounts include three operating accounts. The retiree healthcare account is
managed by a trust and legally cannot be used to fund operations. The Commission earmarked two
accounts for the Reserve and Harvest programs, and the Commission no longer uses these reserves to
supplement operating cash. As shown in Chart 2, as of June 30, 2020, the Commission’s operating cash
coverage remains at a positive rate of 4 months coverage of operating expenses as the Commission
continues to restrict contributions to the oyster programs.

The Honorable Ralph S. Northam
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Kenneth R. Plum
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2020. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commission’s financial system; review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls; test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and review corrective
actions of audit findings from the prior year report.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances.

We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also tested details of
transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system. The financial information presented in this report
came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted a matter involving internal control and its operation that requires management’s
attention and corrective action. The results of our tests of compliance with applicable laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are
required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. The matter is described in the section
entitled “Audit Finding and Recommendation.”
Status of Prior Findings
The Commission has taken adequate corrective action with respect to audit findings reported in
the prior year that are not repeated in this letter.

Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on September 15, 2020. Management’s response to
the finding identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did not

This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
