Audit Overview
(cid:190) The Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA) is
responsible for developing comprehensive
treatment and rehabilitation services for
individuals with mental illness. MHA’s functions
include:
(cid:131) overseeing the provision of publicly funded
services for the care and treatment of
individuals with mental disorders;
(cid:131) supervising State mental health facilities; and
(cid:131) reviewing and approving local government
plans for treatment of the mentally ill.
(cid:190) MHA’s expenditures during FY 2007 totaled
approximately $575 million, the vast majority of
which was incurred for mental health services.
(cid:190) Our report, which covered the audit period from
July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2007, included 11
findings, 3 of which were repeated from the
preceding audit report.

Overview of Key Audit Findings
(cid:190) MHA did not ensure that federal reimbursement
requests were submitted timely or that when
submitted, reimbursement was requested for all
allowable costs. For example, due to the use of
incorrect provider rates, $1.15 million in federal
funds was not claimed in CY 2006.
(cid:190) MHA procedures for reviewing authorization
decisions made by its administrative service
organization (ASO) were inadequate. During, FY
2007, the ASO was paid $14.4 million to manage,
process and pay claims totaling $475 million.
(cid:190) Interest income totaling $1.8 million earned on
funds use to pay providers was not transferred to
the State’s General Fund, as required.
(cid:190) Independent reviews of provider claims paid by the
ASO excluded certain verification procedures and
problems found were not always investigated.
(cid:190) Sufficient action was not taken to recover provider
advances totaling $737,000.

Accuracy of Federal Reimbursement Requests
MHA did not ensure that federal reimbursement
rates received for certain eligible services
corresponded to the related service rates paid to
providers. (Finding 1)
(cid:131) OLA analysis of CY 2006 claims paid disclosed
approximately 270,000 claims for which the
related federal reimbursement was based on
amounts totaling $2.3 million less than the
actual service rates paid to the providers.
(cid:131) Consequently, the State received $1.15 million
(50 percent federal reimbursement of $2.3
million) less in federal funding than it would
have if the actual claim amount had been used
to calculate the federal reimbursement.
(cid:131) Prior to our analysis, MHA had not identified
this situation nor initiated any necessary
corrective action.

Untimely Federal Reimbursement Requests
Eligible provider claims were not always submitted
for federal reimbursement within the timeframe
required by federal regulations. (Finding 2)
(cid:131) Federal regulations require that claims be
submitted within a specified two-year period
after payment to the provider.
(cid:131) OLA test of 26 claims paid by the ASO found 7
that appeared to have exceeded the two-year
period, and federal reimbursement totaling
approximately $43,000 had not been obtained
for those claims.
(cid:131) Federal authorities advised that there are only
a limited number of exceptions to the time
requirement, and MHA had no documentation
that the tested claims met any of these
exceptions.

Review of ASO Service Authorization Decisions
MHA lacked adequate procedures for systematically
reviewing service authorization decisions made by
the ASO. The ASO paid $475 million for provider
claims in FY 2007. (Finding 3)
(cid:131) Although State regulations require MHA to
regularly and systematically review the ASO’s
authorization decisions, MHA could not
document how it selected these decisions for
review, including sample size, types of service
to examine, and frequency of such reviews.
(cid:131) For example, MHA reviewed 12 inpatient
hospital authorizations decisions made by the
ASO during FY 2007, even though the ASO
authorized approximately 20,000 inpatient
stays in the first 6 months of that year. We
question whether the sample selected for
review was sufficiently comprehensive.

ASO Claim Audits and Bank Account Interest
(cid:190) The ASO did not perform the number of
contractually required inpatient claim audits.
(Finding 4)
(cid:131) The contract requires the ASO to audit,
including a review of related billing and
medical records, claims filed by a minimum of
6 inpatient facilities per year to ensure claim
accuracy.
(cid:131) As of June 30, 2007, only 2 such audits had
been performed since inception of the
contract in October 2004; while inpatient
claims paid from July 2006 to April 2007
totaled $75.6 million.
(cid:190) Interest income earned in a bank account
established by MHA for the ASO’s use in
processing claims had not been transferred to the
State’s General Fund since the account’s
inception in October 2004, as required by the
State Treasurer. As of June 2007, interest earned
totaled approximately $1.8 million. (Finding 5)

Contractor Claim Reviews
MHA did not adequately monitor a contract executed
with a private entity to perform periodic reviews of
selected claims processed by the ASO for the
purpose of ensuring compliance with certain
requirements, such as proper authorization.
(cid:131) The entity’s procedures excluded certain critical
attributes, such as verifying that claims paid
entirely from State funds were not actually
eligible for federal reimbursement, and that the
claims were submitted by providers within the
timeframe required by State regulations. OLA
found $39,000 in claims miscoded as not
eligible for federal reimbursement. (Finding 6)
(cid:131) Deficiencies and discrepancies identified by the
contractor’s reviews of the ASO were not always
investigated and resolved. For example, reports
noted differences between actual provider
payments and established rates, but reports
frequently did not note how the findings were
resolved. (Finding 7)

Collection of Provider Advances No Longer Needed
Sufficient action had not been taken to collect
provider advances totaling approximately
$737,000. (Finding 9)
(cid:131) These funds had been advanced several
years ago for various reasons, including
delays in processing claims by the former
ASO (pre-October 2004).
(cid:131) MHA had no documentation that action had
been taken to recover these amounts, such
as offsetting future claims from the provider
or submission to the Department of Budget
and Management’s Central Collection Unit.
(cid:131) During CY 2006, one provider with
outstanding advances of $187,000
received claim payments of approximately
$4 million that possibly could have been
used to offset the amount due.

Conclusion
MHA should:
(cid:190) ensure the propriety of federal reimbursement for
paid claims and recover any amounts due when
reimbursement was based on less than the actual
claims paid. Furthermore, claims for federal
reimbursement should be submitted within the
required timeframe.
(cid:190) establish adequate procedures to select ASO
service authorization decisions to ensure sufficient
review coverage, and ensure that the ASO conducts
the required number of claim audits.
(cid:190) verify that interest income is regularly transferred to
the State’s General Fund.
(cid:190) ensure that procedures used in contractor claim
reviews include all critical verification procedures,
and that significant deficiencies and discrepancies
noted are investigated and resolved.
(cid:190) initiate recovery procedures for outstanding
provider advances.
