AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Develop Strategy to Address Going Concern Issue
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (first issued in fiscal year 2016)
The Commission continues to have a potential going concern issue, as it appears that they do not
have the resources to continue operating without using their reserve funds. The Commission is not
aggressively monitoring operating cash balances or developing strategies to increase revenues or
decrease expenses. During fiscal year 2017, the Commission used $80,000 in cash restricted for future
projects to cover operating expenses when there was no operating cash available. As of June 30, 2017,
the Commission had not reimbursed the reserve for these funds. At the end of fiscal year 2017, the
Commission’s deficit for restricted funds totaled approximately $145,000, an increase of $55,000 over
the fiscal year 2016 deficit. The Commission continues to annually set-aside funds generated from
operations to support future oyster work. The Commission’s operating loss of $84,000 in fiscal year
2017, demonstrates the Commission’s inability to operate with a positive cash balance.
The Commission decided to fund two oyster preservation projects over the past six years, in total
for $400,000, and did not consider the toll these projects would take on operating expenses. They
expected the programs to be self-sustaining; however, even though the Commission is no longer funding
the projects at $50,000 per year each, the Commission has also diverted certain revenues, which were
previously used for operating expenses, for these projects. The diverted revenues include all oyster
licenses, surcharges, inspection taxes, and identification tags.
While the Commission has recently begun to address this problem, they have not taken any
extraordinary measures to bring the situation under control. The Commission is slowly researching ways
to increase revenues; however, they should perform more stringent reviews of their revenue streams.
While they have evaluated where they can reduce expenses, they continue to fund the oyster programs,
diverting all oyster revenues to the programs. The Commission needs to take a hard line with respect to
these revenues and begin maintaining these license revenues in the operating budget. If there are excess
funds at year end, the Commission could then consider further funding of the oyster programs. In
addition, the Commission needs to evaluate new projects in light of their mission and purpose, which is
the responsibility for adopting the rules, regulations, and licenses for both commercial and recreational
taking, catching, or attempting to catch fish, crabs, oysters, and clams from the tidal Potomac River
waters. The Virginia Potomac River Compact of 1958 established the Commission to conserve and
improve all valuable fishery resources of the river. While the preservation of the oyster population is
important, concentrating all funding efforts in this area without regard for other areas of responsibility
and the need for funds for ongoing administrative operations could result in the inability to remain a
viable going concern.

Improve Financial Recording
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (first issued in fiscal year 2016)
The Commission still does not have accounting personnel with adequate knowledge of
accounting standards to properly record and process the Commissions’ uncommon financial
transactions. This has resulted in various inaccuracies, as described below, in the Commissions financial
records.
During fiscal year 2017, the Fiscal Officer did not properly capitalize expenses for capital assets.
The Commission replaced one HVAC unit totaling $8,259, which the Fiscal Officer expensed to “Building
Maintenance” rather than capitalizing the unit as “Building Improvements.” The Commission’s
capitalization policy requires capitalization of all additions, renovations, and repairs to capital assets that
increase the economic benefits of the assets. In addition, the policy requires capitalization for assets
that have an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of $5,000 or more at the
date of acquisition.
The Fiscal Officer did not prepare the year-end adjusting entry to record the expense of the
annual contribution to the Retiree Healthcare investment account resulting in an understatement of
expenses of $53,500. In addition, the Fiscal Officer did not adjust the liability account for interest earned
resulting in an understatement of $2,813. These errors resulted in a total understatement of the liability
account of $56,313.
As noted in our prior year management recommendation, in completing the annual
reimbursement from the Healthcare investment account, the Fiscal Officer incorrectly calculated the
annual expense amount resulting in a cumulative under-reimbursement of operating funds of $4,044.
However, the Fiscal Officer did not reimburse the operating account for this amount as recommended
in last year’s report.
Finally, as noted in the prior year, a review of the Oyster Management Reserve and the Rotational
Oyster Harvest Program revealed that the Commission was not properly accounting for these programs.
For fiscal year 2017, while the Commission now accounts for these programs within their operating
expenses, the Fiscal Officer did not adjust the liability account related to this future oyster work resulting
in an understatement to the account of $20,268.
Overstatement of liabilities and expenses hinders the ability of the Commission to assess its
financial position and make sound financial decisions. The prior Fiscal Officer retired in December 2017,
and the Commission promoted a current employee to the position. The Commission authorized and the
new Fiscal Officer has taken training in the accounting system and classes in accounting at the local
community college. The Commission should continue to encourage the current Fiscal Officer to seize
the opportunity to enhance her knowledge. We also recommended that the Commission should ensure
that the Executive Secretary has adequate knowledge of accounting procedures affording him the
capability to determine that transactions recorded in the financial system are proper and correct.
Neither the Commission or the Executive Secretary have taken steps to ensure the Executive Secretary’s
accounting knowledge is enhanced. We continue to recommend that the Executive Secretary, at a
minimum, take a basic accounting course to enable him to understand accounting principles.

Prepare Bank Reconciliations Timely
Type: Internal Control
Repeat: Yes (first issued in fiscal year 2016)
During fiscal year 2017, the Commission did not prepare bank reconciliations timely. The
Commission holds five checking/savings accounts, which requires them to complete a total of 60
reconciliations. The Assistant Executive Secretary prepared reconciliations sixty to ninety days after
month end for 34 reconciliations or 57 percent. Due to these issues, we expanded our review of
reconciliations into fiscal year 2018. Between July 2017 and March 2018, the Assistant Executive
Secretary prepared bank reconciliations for all accounts between 65 and 90 days after each month end
for 37 percent of the reconciliations.
The Commission policy manual does not outline a timeframe for the completion of the
reconciliations. Best practices suggest that the Commission should complete a reconciliation at least
monthly to ensure that transactions are correct and no fraud has occurred. Without timely reconciliation
of all bank accounts, the Commission increases the risk that unauthorized expenditures will occur and
that deposits will not be properly recorded. The Executive Secretary needs to set specific deadlines for
completion of all monthly bank reconciliations and monitor to ensure that the Assistant Executive
Secretary prepares the reconciliations timely.
Develop Disaster Recovery Plan and Perform Continuity of Operations Testing
Type: Internal Control and Compliance
Repeat: No
The Commission has not adopted an applicable security standard and does not have an adequate
disaster recovery plan. The Commission performs daily backups of their servers; however, they have
never tested the backups to ensure the backup is effective. In addition, the Commission stores backups
in an unsecure and unprotected off-site location. Therefore, the backups are subject to damage,
destruction, or loss.
The Commission’s disaster recovery plan does not include documented manual workarounds
that will allow the Commission to continue functioning during recovery times after a disaster event. As
a result, the Commission does not perform continuity of operations (COOP) testing. Testing the COOP
is an essential process to verify the Commission can continue performing mission essential business
functions until the restoration of critical information systems. Not periodically testing the COOP to
ensure that employees can efficiently execute roles and responsibilities during an emergency could
potentially delay resuming business operations and may not meet the Commission’s pre-determined
recovery time objective expectations.
The Commission should determine which of the security standards would work best for the size
of their operations and adopt that standard. Based on the adopted standard, the Commission should
develop a robust recovery plan that includes documented manual workarounds and a secure off-site
storage location for backups. In addition, the Commission should begin periodic COOP testing to ensure
operations can continue in the event of a disaster.

COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTS
The Potomac River Fisheries Commission is a bi-state commission established to conserve and
improve the fishery resources of the tidewater portion of the Potomac River. The Commission’s
leadership consists of eight Commissioners, four representing Maryland and four representing Virginia.
During the current and previous fiscal years, the Commission received revenues from the
following sources.
Commission Revenues
Table 1
2016 2017
Virginia appropriations $148,750 $148,750
Maryland appropriations 140,000 140,000
Federal and other grants 63,754 44,975
Sport fishing licenses 143,678 125,267
Commercial fishing licenses 76,880 80,872
Commercial crab licenses 68,545 71,240
Commercial oyster licenses 88,262 90,500
Commercial license surcharge 38,250 25,500
Oyster bushel tax 11,698 21,733
Interest and miscellaneous 35,868 41,752
Total revenue $815,685 $790,589
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission’s revenues decreased by three percent for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to
decreases in the sales of oyster licenses and non-commercial fishing licenses. These license revenues
decreased due to the closing of oyster hand scraping harvest areas and a decrease in the sale of pleasure
boat licenses.

Reserve Fund deposits for:
Retiree health care 53,500 53,500
Total expenses $804,267 $874,025
Source: Commission’s financial system
Total expenses increased by eight percent from fiscal year 2016. This is mainly attributable to
the continued payment of oyster seeding expenses, which included $62,000 of fiscal year 2016 expenses
that were not paid until fiscal year 2017. These increasing costs coupled with decreasing revenues
continues to be a concern for the Commission in the future.
The Commission closed fiscal year 2017 with an operating loss of $83,436, including funding of
the retiree healthcare trust.
The Commission is retaining less cash overall each year. While the Commission ended the year
with a positive balance in the operating fund as shown in Chart 1 below, this was the result of use of the
oyster programs cash reserves. The funds reserved for two oyster projects and authorized by the
Commission in 2012 and 2013 continue in a deficit situation, as the Commission continues to use the
cash reserves to pay operating expenses. For further discussion on this issue, see the finding entitled
“Develop Strategy to Address Going Concern Issue” in the section “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.”

Fiscal Year
Source: Commission’s financial system
The Commission closed fiscal year 2017 with an overall cash balance of $584,189, which was a
six percent decrease ($38,122) over fiscal year 2016 levels. The decrease is due to the timing of expenses
at year-end for the Oyster Management Reserve program and the Rotational Oyster Harvest Program in
the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts, respectively. The Commission paid approximately
$62,000 in expenses related to fiscal year 2016 in fiscal year 2017. The cash balance includes $103,383
in the Virginia and Maryland investment pool accounts to fund future oyster work and $429,948 in a
separate Virginia investment pool account for retiree health care reserves as of June 30, 2017. The
retiree healthcare account is managed by a trust and legally cannot be used to fund operations. The
Commission earmarked the other two accounts for the Oyster Management Reserve and Rotational
Natural Oyster Harvest Program projects, and the Commission should not use the reserves to
supplement operating cash. The Commission has traditionally maintained sufficient operating cash to
cover two to three months of expenses. However, as shown in Chart 2 on the following page, as of
June 30, 2017, the Commission’s operating cash coverage continues to decrease due to the
Commission’s contributions to the oyster programs and deflection of other revenues to these programs.
Although the operating account cash balance at year-end was $50,859, the funds are only there because
the Commission borrowed cash from the restricted funds to pay operating costs. The operating fund
owes the restricted funds $144,899, essentially leaving a negative cash balance in the operating fund.

The Honorable Ralph S. Northam
Governor of Virginia
The Honorable Thomas K. Norment, Jr.
Chairman, Joint Legislative Audit
and Review Commission
We have audited the financial records and operations of the Potomac River Fisheries
Commission for the year ended June 30, 2017. We conducted this performance audit in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Audit Objectives
Our audit’s primary objectives were to evaluate the accuracy of recorded financial transactions
in the Commission’s financial system, review the adequacy of the Commission’s internal controls, test
compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, and review corrective
actions of audit findings from the prior year report.
Audit Scope and Methodology
The Commission’s management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal
control and complying with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Internal
control is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting, effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements.
We gained an understanding of the overall internal controls, both automated and manual,
sufficient to plan the audit. We considered significance and risk in determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures. Our review encompassed controls over the following significant cycles, classes of
transactions, and account balances.

Payroll expenses Federal grant revenues and expenses
Appropriations
We performed audit tests to determine whether the Commission’s controls were adequate, had
been placed in operation, and were being followed. Our audit also included tests of compliance with
provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. Our audit procedures
included inquiries of appropriate personnel, inspection of documents, records, and contracts, and
observation of the Commission’s operations. We performed analytical procedures, including budgetary
and trend analyses. We confirmed bank balances with outside parties. We also tested details of
transactions to achieve our objectives.
A nonstatistical sampling approach was used. Our samples were designed to support conclusions
about our audit objectives. An appropriate sampling methodology was used to ensure the samples
selected were representative of the population and provided sufficient, appropriate evidence. We
identified specific attributes for testing each of the samples and when appropriate, we projected our
results to the population.
Conclusions
We found that the Commission properly stated, in all material respects, the amounts recorded
and reported in the Commission’s financial system, except as noted in the finding titled “Improve
Financial Recording” in the section entitled “Audit Findings and Recommendations.” The financial
information presented in this report came directly from the Commission’s financial system.
We noted certain matters involving internal control and its operation and compliance with
applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements that require management’s attention and
corrective action. These matters are described in the section entitled “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.”
The Commission has not taken adequate corrective action with respect to audit findings reported
in the prior year and; therefore, those findings are repeated in the section entitled “Audit Findings and
Recommendations.”
Exit Conference and Report Distribution
We discussed this report with management on June 4, 2018. Management’s response to the
findings identified in our audit is included in the section titled “Commission Response.” We did not audit
management’s response and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
This report is intended for the information and use of the Governor and General Assembly,
management, and the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia and is a public record.
